    "description": "The Geomark datasets are spatial reference files that describe the feature, its location and its name. Examples of the types of features included in these datasets are: rivers, water bodies, railway lines, parks, airports, hospitals, education centres, emergency facilities, sport facilities, mountains, transport infrastructure, power facilities and community venues (but not road names). The data contained within the individual Geomark datasets has been sourced from Vicmap Elevation, Vicmap Hydro, Vicmap Features of Interest and Vicmap Transport. The difference between the features in these Vicmap datasets and Geomark is that the Geomark features have been combined to create one piece of geometry based on its name and type.\nGEOMARK_POINT : A statewide point dataset containing information for “named” or “could be named” features. Points represent relatively small area features that have been generalised or larger features where the spatial source is a coordinate or an address. Examples of small area point entities include wind turbines, snow poles, and emergency markers.\nGEOMARK_LINE : A statewide line dataset containing information for “named” or “could be named” features.

They include areas of sediment supply (sources), sediment loss (sinks), and the sediment transport processes linking them (pathways). Sediment transport pathways include both alongshore and cross-shore processes, and therefore cells are best represented in two-dimensions.

    "description": "This dataset comprises the results of phytoplankton pigment composition analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network - National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. Pigment samples are taken for the complete water column (0-50m) and at the depths of the shallow WQM and the deeper WQM attached to the mooring at that site.\n\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\n\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\n\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\n\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\n\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

    "description": "Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) is the percentage of ground area occupied by the vertical projection of foliage. The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on regression models applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM  and Landsat-8 OLI imagery for the period 1988-2014. An annual woody spectral index image is created for each year using a multiple regression model trained from field data collected mostly over the period 1996-1999. A robust regression of the time series of the annual woody spectral index is then performed. The estimated foliage projective cover is the prediction at the date of the selected dry season image for 2014. Where this deviates significantly from the woody spectral index for that date, further tests are undertaken before this estimate is accepted. In some cases, the final estimate is the woody spectral index value rather than the robust regressionprediction. The product is further masked to remove areasclassified as non-woody (see Landsat Woody Vegetation Extent - Queensland 2014). Corrections have been applied to remove errors due to topographic effects, cloud, cloud shadow, water, cropping, and regrowth following clearing. Some errors may remain. The product was generated from WRS-2 path/row scenes obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Tennant Creek for 2019. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "This experiment tested the effects of secondary treated sewage effluent on infauna assemblages that were taken from a 'reference' site immediately after a large dump of macroalgae had cleared from the mudflat. Macroalgae cover can have severe effects on infaunal assemblages so it was expected that the recent macroalgae dump would affect the responses of infauna to the effluent dosing. Twelve intact sediment cores were collected from this site on the Western Treatment Plant foreshore (Port Phillip Bay, Victoria) and brought back to the laboratory. Four cores were assigned to each of the two treatments, which were high dose (7mls effluent per minute) or no dose of effluent. The experiment ran for 13 days in October 1999. \n\nThroughout the experimental period, dissolved oxygen levels were measured and animals that migrated from the sediment were collected, counted and identified. At the end of the experiment, sediment chlorophyll levels were measured and infauna remaining in the sediment were counted and identified.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the biomass sampling component of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80 deg C)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "title": "An investigation of hypothesis testing and power analysis in impact assessment, using case studies of marine infauna.",
    "description": "This thesis used several BACI-style statistical tests for impact (MBACI and BACI-style planned comparisons) and examined the statistical power of the tests using infaunal data from 2 long-term monitoring programs. The monitoring programs were conducted between 1982 and 1994 to assess the impact of 2 coastal waste discharge points off Ninety Mile Beach in eastern Victoria, Australia. The sampling programs are outlined in the attached resource and the datasets generated from these programs are outlined in the related child metadata records. \n\nEstimates of variance of infaunal abundance calculated from the statistical tests were extremely variable. Estimates from the same taxon, from studies in the same region, using identical sampling methods, differed by an order of magnitude or more in 25% of cases.  The worst estimates of variance were usually obtained from single surveys, which had no component of large-scale temporal variation. This suggests that estimates of variances based on single sampling times can be unreliable and it may be desirable to initially include more replicates to allow for a larger than expected error variance.  \n\nThe effect sizes observed in the infaunal data were very variable, with the most extreme being in excess of 10000% change. Many of the observed effects appeared to be natural events rather than as a result of a disturbance. Effect sizes for power calculations should be made in a meaningful ecological context to ensure impact assessments are both meaningful and statistically powerful. \n\nGradient analysis is the main alternative to the BACI-style designs in impact assessments and, in this study, provided an indication of the spatial extent of an impact however comparison with a more conventional BACIP design suggested it might be more costly to undertake. Compositing and subsampling infaunal samples was shown to be one way to reduce the costs of assessing impacts in soft sediments. \n\nThe patterns of variability seen in these data sets resulted in some large and unpredictable error variances and observed effect sizes. To reduce such problems it may be necessary to include multiple sampling times in long-term monitoring programs.",

The data shows business establishments with their trading name, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, location and CLUE block and small area allocation. The data covers the year period of 2013.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has acquired the data through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "The Other Structure Feature Class sits within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Assets Geodatabase. The Other Structure layer includes infrastructure items associated with historic heritage such as historic ruins, lighthouses, monuments, silos and stockyards as well as other miscellaneous features such as beacons, channel markers and wildlife structures.\n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially. The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes. The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS. The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field. AMS is also set up to be used by other OEH Divisions eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point. \n\nDetailed documentation is available including: - Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets) - Data Model - Business Rules - Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed. Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) hydro systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data is available for May 2020 and June 2020, and it also includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 7 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

This service generally contains the current standard Topographic maps from the 1:100,000; 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 series.\nWhere coverage exists at multiple scales, the largest scale map is displayed.&nbsp;\n\nThe sourced Geotiff file is cropped to the map window only, with no legend, disclaimers, map grid, scale bar or north arrow displayed. The NSW Topographic Map series is derived from Spatial Services’ Digital Topographic Database (DTDB).&nbsp;\n\nInformation viewed in this web service includes:• Roads• Points of interest• Localities• Contours• Drainage• Cultural data• Parks and forests• Property boundaries.&nbsp;\n\nThis web service allows users to easily integrate the topographic map cache coverage for NSW into Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant spatial platforms and applications.&nbsp;\n\nThe NSW Topographic Map Cache web service can be used for mapping, emergency services, natural resource management, geosciences and sustainable development.&nbsp;\n\nThis service ensures users are able to consume topographic map data without the requirement of hosting the map files on their own servers. It is important to note that depictions of roads and tracks do not necessarily indicate a public right of way.&nbsp;\n\nUnlawful entry upon private land or a restricted area and/or wilful damage of property such as gates and fences expose offenders to legal prosecution.&nbsp;Initial Publication Date31/07/2019Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

It is divided into the seven themes of the FSDF and two categories Each of these themes is made up of various Feature Classes (or layers) that contain the relevant spatial data and their associated attributes and relationships. This dataset was captured by utilising the best available source at a variety of scales and accuracies,&nbsp;ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m.A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:3857WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Terms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and Specification\nOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.&nbsp;This dataset is compliant with the NSW Foundation Spatial Data Framework and its specifications.Data CustodianDCS Spatial Services346 Panorama AveBathurst NSW 2795Point of ContactPlease contact us via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data AggregatorDCS Spatial Services346 Panorama AveBathurst NSW 2795Data DistributorDCS Spatial Services346 Panorama AveBathurst NSW 2795Additional Supporting Information<a href=\"https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/publications/information_sheets/data_dictionaries\">Data Dictionaries</a>TRIM Number",

The RWS boundaries are derived from Water Resource Plan (WRP) boundaries for the inland areas. The coastal areas are aligned with the Water Sharing Plan (WSP) boundaries. The Murray RWS boundary is further defined using the Geoscience Australia's geofabric data HR Regions layer.

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2021 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2021 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2021 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia conducted a marine seismic survey (GA-0352) over various areas of the Gippsland Basin, between 5th of April to the 24th of April 2015, by the Gardline CGG vessel MV Duke. This service includes all the bathymetry data collected during the survey, with the data also available as a free download from the Geoscience Australia website.\n\nThe aim of the survey was to acquire industry-standard precompetitive 2D seismic data, Multi-beam echo-sounder (MBES) and sub-bottom profiling (SBP) data to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the basin. The survey, undertaken as part of the Department of Industry and Science's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP), aimed to identify and characterise indicators of natural hydrocarbon or fluid seepage that may indicate compromised seal integrity in the region. The data collected during this survey will enhance sequence stratigraphic studies in the Gippsland Basin that provide constraints on the most suitable areas for storage of CO2 and help to identify potential CO2 storage reservoirs.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

This has \nnecessitated additional filtering to support the use of the data for decision-making.\nThe filtering process involved removing:\na) Records that were accurate to the suburb only level\nb) Records where the co-ordinates given were inconsistent with the location \ninformation in the record field\nc) Records that were otherwise identical but had different dates\nd) All records without a CC-BY 4.0 licence. Any threatened species under NSW or \nfederal law (species defined as ‘sensitive’ are excluded for this public release as \nthey cannot be distributed without written consent of DCCEW).\nThis filtering for b) and c) was achieved by removing records whose co-ordinates were \nwithin 1m of each other. The filtering process removed 73% (67% from b) and c), 6% from \nd) of all Bionet wildlife vehicle strike records identified by the data query leaving 18,367\nstate-wide.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne employs a contractor to perform traffic counts on roads throughout the municipality. The numbers of vehicles are recorded per hour and split into 12 categories based on the Austroads vehicle classification. Vehicle class 13 is used when the type of vehicle can’t be determined.\n\nIn the 2017/16 surveys all bikes, motorcycles and maximum speeds were captured. In the 2015 surveys not all surveys captured bikes, motorcycles and maximum speed. In the 2014 surveys no bikes, motorcycles or maximum speed were captured.\n\nThis data is designed to be joined to the road corridor data on road_segment and seg_id. Some records have more than one road segment this is because the survey crosses intersecting roads and the intersections have a road segment number. In the Road corridor table some road segments will have the same seg_id.\n\n\nFor a description of each field please see the attached data dictionary.\n\n<b>Known data issues:</b>\n- 112 records had vehicle_class fields which contained the character '-'. This should value should be a 0 value.",

It was provided to\nGeoscience Australia in early 2011 by PRL.\nThis shapefile is a first pass only. There is the possibility of adding further cleared areas\nthrough closer inspection of the orthophoto’s and redefining some of the edges to more\nclosely represent the area cleared.\nThe Pre-PRL Clearing data was digitized by hand by PRL in October 2010 from aerial photographs taken in 1976, 1982 and 1987. The 1976 image was used first,\nthen 1982, then 1987 making sure that each polygon snapped to the last.\nGenerally digitises at 1:5000 although this is variable.\nAll polygons have been assigned an attribute and the year represent the first time the area is\nindicated as being cleared off the orthophoto.\nThis data is logical as each attributed year shows the progress of clearing across Christmas\nIsland in a logical manner.\nDisclaimer",

The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA3. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA3 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset displays the position and extents of fuel breaks that have been identified to be upgraded in the RFMP 2019-28. Strategic fuel breaks are usually located between assets and surrounding rural areas or bushland. Fuel breaks typically consist of an area of variable width next to an existing track or road where bushfire fuels are maintained at lower levels. The lower fuel levels within fuel breaks result in much reduced fire behaviour. In this way, they provide a defensible space in which fire fighters may work with increased safety to protect assets, usually associated with back-burning activities during fire suppression operations. They also provide an opportunity to ‘break-up’ fire runs and assist with prescribed burning operations.",

    "description": "Contemporary refugia contain communities that are strongly associated with climatic and topographic factors that confer a degree of protection from endangering processes such as fire and disease. These refugia have two important roles: they provide locations for the conservation of species and communities and they provide sources for population expansion if limiting conditions abate. \n\nPlaces qualifying as refuges from frequent fire do so because, although they contain plants sensitive to fire, they are protected in the landscape by climatic, topographic and soil features. It is generally accepted, however, that very few, if any, places have totally escaped the effects of fire in Tasmania and that refugia will have occasionally been burnt under extreme fire conditions. But such events are considered much rarer in these places in comparison with areas that lack the protection afforded by refugia. It is the low frequency of burning that marks these places as significant. \n\nAfter wildfire, forest communities associated with refugia are usually slower to recover and may take many decades, even centuries, to do so.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:100 000 scale). Refugia from present processes are coded with a unique number and the relevant National Estate values and criteria.\n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criterion A2: Importance in maintaining existing processes or natural systems at the regional or national scale.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1997.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in March 2008, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

The forecasts refer to the 30 June in each stated year.\n\nWA Tomorrow includes three forecast bands (Lower, Central, Upper), indicating three probable futures. For the user who requires the best estimate of future population size, the central forecast should be used. \nFor further information please consult the <a href=\"https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-planning-lands-and-heritage/western-australia-tomorrow-12-population-forecasts\">WA Tomorrow 12 website</a>",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nAsset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion (SSB) on 18 December 2015 (v1.1) supersedes the previous version of the SSB Asset database V1.0 (Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 03 August 2015, GUID: e453be86-2ddc-488b-9490-2e7c9ee130b7). It contains the Asset database (SSB_asset_database_20151218.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (SSB_asset_database_20151218_GISOnly.gdb), a data dictionary (SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the Water Asset Information Tool (WAIT) process as outlined below. This version should be used for Materiality Test (M2) test.\n\n\n\nThe user needs to join the Table Assetlist  or Elementlist  to the spatial data.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Sydney regions are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Sydney Basin bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\t              Notes\n\n1\t               1.0\t               3/08/2015\tInitial database.\n\n2\t               1.1\t               18/12/2015\t\"(1) Added 93 assets/9897elements from 18 datasets required by SSB asset workshop.\n\n                                                                                      (2) Fixed 22 AIDs in spatial data, which can not directly join  to relevant table in asset database\"\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 18 December 2015.

    "title": "Spatial causal network for green hydrogen production in the Upper Spencer Gulf region, South Australia",
    "description": "This dataset was compiled by the Water for Sustainable Hydrogen project from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The spatial causal network comprises a rigorous and comprehensive scientific assessment of potential causal pathways by which hydrogen and renewable energy development can affect environmental assets. The network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.",

    "description": "Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. \n\nExperiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. Previous experiments have revealed that owners win more contests than floaters because they are more motivated. This experiment was designed to test if owners are more motivated than floaters in response to high quality territories.\n\nThe results revealed that owners won more contests in 'high quality' territories than in 'natural' territories but this difference was not significant. Although owners win more contests in 'High quality' territories, the lack of significance may indicate only a small asymmetry between owners and floaters. It is possible that owners and floaters have similar abilities to perceive the food availability and be similar in motivational level.",

    "description": "Surface Water Management subareas for Western Australia were derived in consultation with the regional offices, and geometry is based on hydrographic catchments. Regional Department of Environment officers identified areas of similar management requirements to define boundaries or aggregations of hydrographic subcatchments. Regions with notable management concerns both currently and possibly in the future were identified to become management subareas. Management subareas will be used in the calculation of sustainable yields, flow rates and ultimately these calculations will be available for water allocation and natural resource management decisions. In addition, native vegetation clearing values have been calculated for each of the subareas located within the extent of the South-West region of Western Australia, for input into the allocation process.\n\nThe Surface Water subarea data was developed in order to give a clear understanding of surface water availability and to provide management tools to make good water allocation and natural resources management decisions.\n\nDataset was formerly known as Surface Water Management Subareas (DOW-021)",

Users can also create, save and print maps which display the map layers of interest. In addition, the Miners and Explorers Map can be used by miners and explorers to locate and/or avoid areas of environmental sensitivity when planning their projects. The Miners and Explorers Map can be used to:  \n\n\nInterrogate and interpret data layers  \n\n\nLocate existing mining and exploration titles  \n\n\nPlan exploration proposals by plotting points, drilling locations and calculating areas and distances  \n\n\nRun an “Area Analysis” to see where data layers overlap with an existing mining or exploration title  \n\n\nCreate, save and print maps that can be submitted with exploration activity applications  \n\n\nHelp explorers to comply with the Complying Exploration Activity (CEA) pathway for an exploration activity application.

Data are obtained from in-situ data loggers deployed on the reef. Data loggers instantaneously record sea temperatures every 30 minutes and are exchanged and downloaded approximately every 12 months. Temperature loggers on the reef-flat are generally placed just below Lowest Astronomical Tide level. Reef-slope (or where specified as Upper reef-slope) generally refers to depths 5 - 9 m while Deep reef-slope refers to depths of ~20 m.",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST012009.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, New South Wales, January 25, 2009\nArrived:  \tWellington, New Zealand, February 1, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This report describes the hydraulic modelling for the first stage of a flood study of the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley commissioned by the Water Board in 1987. The study is required in order to \"determine the effects that various arrangements of major or future works for Warragamba Dam have on flooding in the valley\" (Revised Brief for the Preparation of an E.I.S., Water Boards August 1987). Stage 1 required a simplified model to be developed, calibrated and used to provide a measure of the relative effects on flooding of options for such works.\nThe model used is described in Section 2. Section 3 describes the calibration phase, in which three historical floods were used to adjust model parameters in order to match historical and modelled flood heights. The various options for Warragamba Dam flood protection works have an impact on the outflow hydrographs from the dam. Outflow hydrographs were determined for each option for five \"design\" floods and run through the calibrated hydraulic model. Peak flood heights were then tabulated and compared at three key locations In the valley. Section 4 describes the options while Section 5 discusses the modelling methods used to run these cases. The results are presented as a series of tables and graphs.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.15) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Alpine Peatland flux station was established in 2017 at Heathy Spur I, an alpine sphagnum bog on the Bogong High Plains recognised by Parks Victoria as a reference ecosystem for this endangered ecological community. The vegetation is dominated by the peat-forming moss <em>Sphagnum cristatum</em>, as well as typical peatland species including candle heath (<em>Richea continentis</em>), alpine baeckea (<em>Baeckea gunniana</em>) and rope rush (<em>Empodisma\nminus</em>). The Alpine Peatland tower typically experiences a mild growing season from October to June and 2-3 months of snow cover from July to September.",

The 2016 Interpretation of TEMPEST Airbourne Electromagnetic Data from Esperance (Mira Geoscience) was also used in creating this dataset. This location can change pending known factors that impact the location of the seawater interface including the time of year, tidal movements, abstraction, recharge and throughflow.  \n\nThe full assessment of the SWI in this area is documented in report HR437 Esperance Seawater Interface Priority Area Assessment.\n\nThis dataset is sourced from the Statewide Seawater Interface Project, funded by the Government of Western Australia under the State Groundwater Investigation Program. \n\nIn the Esperance area, the project runs from April 2020 to March 2023 and the data are collected from: \n- Seawater interface monitoring (SWIM) bores installed or owned by the department\n- Downhole natural gamma and induction logging\n- Installation of data loggers and continuous static groundwater level (SWL) measurements from data loggers\n- Electrical conductivity (EC) depth profiling\n- Groundwater chemistry sampling.\n- Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey.\nThe above data that is owned by the department can be downloaded from the Water Information Reporting (WIR) Portal or by contacting the Department. AEM survey data can be downloaded via the interactive geological map tool GeoVIEW.WA from the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety.\n\nInformation on the SWI project can be found on the Western Australia State Government website (www.wa.gov.au).",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the works details from with surface water licences from NSW in the Gloucester & Hunter region. The short guide to NSW Office of Water's licensing data has been provided to accompany the dataset (both the spatial locations and the associated licence details). \n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act).\n\n2.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n3.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n4.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n5.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading). This means a spatial select with not find these WALs and the volumes associated with them. The WAL is still related to a particular Water Source and can be re-associated with a different Licensed Work Approval at a later date.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset was extracted from the NSW Office of Water's licensing system. Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area supplied by the Bioregional Assessment project teams for each area. Corresponding work locations found with each polygon were exported from the licensing system.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2013) NSW Office of Water Surface Water Offtakes - Hunter v1 24102013.

It surveys major wetland sites in the Murray–Darling Basin, and provides invaluable information on the ecosystem health of wetlands and rivers. The survey provides baseline information with which to assess changes in, and impacts on, eastern Australian wetlands and rivers. The survey includes etuaries, coastal lakes, rivers, swamps, floodplains and saline lakes, as well as dams, reservoirs and impoundments.\r\n\r\nFor more information see: https://www.ecosystem.unsw.edu.au/content/rivers-and-wetlands/waterbirds/eastern-australian-waterbird-survey\r\n\r\nThis data was used by the Department of Environment and Energy to produce Figure BIO25 in the Biodiversity theme of Australia State of the Environment 2016, available at\r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/biodiversity/topic/2016/freshwater-species-and-ecosystems#biodiversity-figure-BIO25\r\n",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "The Australian Bureau Of Meteorology - Australian Gridded Intensity, Frequency, Duration Datasets (BOM - IFD) for a 100 year return interval. IFD datasets contain rainfall statistics, with the CSIRO Archive having data for 2, 24 & 72 hour periods at .05° resolution for the South East Australia region covering New South Wales and Victoria. IFD datasets are commonly used in Climate change studies, for design and risk assessment of dams and bridges, design of roof and stormwater drainage systems, flood plain management, soil conservation studies and to express the \"severity\" of a single rainfall event (in terms of its rarity). The process of estimating IFDs, known as frequency analysis, is an important part of hydrological design procedures. An analysis of rainfall data from a single station is often unreliable; not temporally or spatially consistent; and should generally not be used for design purposes. Instead a set of accurate, consistent IFD data was derived for the whole of Australia by the Bureau of Meteorology as part of the revision of Australian Rainfall and Runoff with the Institute of Engineers Australia(1987). INTENSITY is the rainfall rate (in mm per hour), FREQUENCY is how often a type of rainfall event will occur and DURATION is the period of time over which the rain is measured. There are 3 files covering the 2, 24, 72 hr periods (each ~1.03MB) in Ascii Arcg format totaling approximately 3.11 MB.",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2017. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",
