Derwent Bay Watch is a collaborative program between councils and state government that tests water quality at 19 bays, coves and other sites around the estuary during summer months. \nWater samples are collected each Tuesday from the start of December to the end of March and analysed for the faecal indicator bacteria Enterococci (Enteralert method) at the Public health Lab. Because the samples must be cultured, it takes several days to publish the results.",

The paper examines trends in criminal offences and family violence incidents to 30 June 2020, focusing on comparing the period from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 with the same period in 2019.\nThis paper aims to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic, associated behaviour changes and implemented restrictions impacted on crime in Victoria. It examines whether there were changes in the volume, nature or location of offending recorded by police following the introduction of restrictions in late March 2020 and provides an overview of offences recorded for breaching restrictions introduced to address COVID-19.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2014 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who felt their GP always or often showed respect for what they had to say in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) for people aged 50 to 74. The NBCSP began in 2006. It aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from bowel cancer by actively recruiting and screening the eligible target population for early detection or prevention of the disease. The data spans the years of 2015-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of people invited to screen through the NBCSP during the relevant 2-year period, who returned a completed screening test within that period or by 30 June of the following year. The number of individuals invited to screen excludes those who deferred or opted out without completing their screening test.\n\n\nValues assigned to n.p. in the original data have been set to null.\n\n\nSA2 areas were assigned to NBCSP invitees using an SA1 to SA2 correspondence. Those invitees without reliable SA1 details were mapped with a postcode to SA2 correspondences instead, which may lead to some minor inaccuracies in results.\n\n\nSome invitee SA1 codes and postcodes cannot be attributed to an SA2. These invitees were included in an 'Unknown' group where applicable.\n\n\nSome postcodes cross SA2 boundaries, leading to slight inaccuracies.\n\n\nBiennial screening for those aged 50-74 is not fully rolled out. During the time period reported, the specific ages invited within the 50-74 age range included 50, 54, 55, 58, 60, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72 and 74.\n\n\nThese results calculate participation rates using the new NBCSP performance indicator specifications. This indicator now measures a 2-year invitation period and also excludes those who opted off or suspended participation. Therefore, these results cannot be compared to rates reported prior to 2014.\n\n\nNBCSP participation rates per area are not related to bowel cancer incidence rates.\n\n\nSA2 areas with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed. SA2 data for the Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay and Lord Howe Island were suppressed due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nThe 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016, and the 2016-2017 period covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017.\n\n\nParticipation by SA2 is not available for the period 2014-2015.\n\n\nThe number of people in different SA2s may not sum to 'Australia' total due to rounding.\n\n",

    "description": "The NSW SPOT 2025  imagery product is a state-wide satellite dataset for NSW Government. The SPOT 2025 satellite data acquisition period was from December 2024 to May 2025. The imagery scenes used to create the NSW mosaic includes Lord Howe Island. This imagery data set has been acquired through GeoImage Pty Ltd and Airbus Defence and Space.\n\nSPOT satellites offer high resolution imaging over broad areas in a single pass at resolutions up to 1.5m. Such precise coverage is ideal for applications at national and regional scales from 1:250,000 to 1:15,000. SPOT 6 also includes the benefits of the near-infrared (NIR) which enables applications for detection of features not visible to the human eye, such as detecting and monitoring vegetation health.\n\nData products supplied for all of NSW are:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<strong>State-wide mosaic High Definition 75cm resolution (GDA2020)</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n\nState-wide mosaic 1.5m resolution (WGS84 and GDA2020/NSW Lambert) \n</li>\n<li>\n\n100k Mapsheet tiles (GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMulti spectral scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPan sharpened scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPanchromatic scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nShapefile cutlines of statewide mosaic (WGS 84 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe statewide mosaic comes with RGB enhancements with 1:10 compression of the pansharpened imagery in ECW  (63GB) and JP2000 (84GB) format. Individual 100k mapsheet mosaics contain RGB+NIR band combination; unenhanced 16-bit GeoTIFF format tile.\n\nThe NSW mosaic is available from internal DCCEEW APOLLO Image Webserver for DCCEEW employees.\n\nThe 4band 100k mapsheet tiles are available for download from JDAP(pending).\nThe rectified multispectral, pan sharpened and panchromatic scenes are available for download from JDAP (pending)\n\nAcknowledgement when referencing: includes material © Airbus DS 2025\n\nContact spatial.imagery@environment.nsw.gov.au for further information or to request access to the imagery or JDAP \n\n<strong>These image products are only available to other NSW Government agencies upon request.</strong>",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced. This has been calculated with the number of selected females who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nInduction of labour is a set of procedures (pharmacological and/or instrumental) to start the uterus contracting and begin the process of labour.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nThe Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2020) is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management and co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the same as the previously published Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2020) (released 03 December 2020) but with an amended title that more accurately reflects the full extent of the dataset.\r\n\r\nIt was developed from multiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets related to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous land dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the Forests of Australia (2018) dataset.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of final datasets. The following attributes are applied in this dataset:\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous owned__: Freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land and forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: Land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: Land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan.\r\n\r\n* __Other special rights__: Land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements and legislated special cultural use provisions.\r\n\r\nIn this dataset, the attributes of Indigenous ownership, Indigenous management or co-management, and other special rights are applied separately. The dataset structure therefore differs from Indigenous estate datasets published by ABARES in 2018 or earlier.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The NSW Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) is used by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) to classify drought in New South Wales. It integrates weather, climate, soil, and land-use datasets into a single framework to help decision making.\nThe CDI combines meteorological, hydrological and agronomic definitions of drought using indicators for rainfall (RI), soil water (SWI), and plant growth (PGI). From these, a fourth index, the Drought Direction Index (DDI), is developed. Used together, these indices classify the five categories of drought. By using multiple indicators, the CDI provides an overall indication of drought conditions in NSW. \nThe CDI is a long-term drought indicator which tracks events that are at least 9-12 months in duration. It is not overly sensitive to short term climatic events and for this reason can lag field conditions. \nFor more information on the CDI and its underlying indicators, see https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/interactive-drought-map/Learn-more/understanding-the-cdi-phases\nCDI online interactive map https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/interactive-drought-map\nDPIRD's interactive CDI map provides free access to current and historical drought information at the NSW parish level (~10-20 farms), while the underlying monitoring occurs at 1 square kilometre resolution (data provided by ANUClimate). The interactive map is updated daily and displays the latest (4 days lag) CDI and drought indicator values for NSW. \nTime series CDI and indicator data for up to 5 years before present for a particular location can be obtained by using the location search bar or by clicking on the LLS, LGA, then Parish of interest. Time series can be downloaded as figure files (.jpg).\nCDI data cannot be downloaded directly from the interactive map. For access to the data that is displayed on the map, please visit the Seasonal Conditions Information Portal (SCIP) https://edis.spaceport.intersect.org.au/\nThe Seasonal Conditions Information Portal provides access to monthly snapshots of CDI data in several forms:\nMonthly CDI and indicator GIS .zips containing .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj (2020 January to present),\nMonthly CDI and indicator .csv files (2020 January to present),\n    Monthly LGA percentages in drought .csv files (2016 January to present),\n    Weekly updating high-quality parish-level time series figures (.jpg) (2 years before present to present), and \n    Extended parish time series by decade (1970 – 2020).\nThe NSW State Seasonal Update https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/state-seasonal-update contains a verified version of CDI information released as monthly report and accompanying text.\nIncludes: statewide overviews of monthly indicators, including the CDI, rainfall, temperature, remotely-sensed vegetation and water availability Regional (Local Land Service) breakdowns of seasonal conditions Climate driver updates Seasonal forecasts of rainfall, temperature, and drought.\nNSW Drought in a Changing Climate Report: The NSW-CDI has also been utilised to assesses the longer term risk of future drought using CMIP6 climate projections to drive the EDIS system.  A report summarising the project and its results are available here https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/seasonal-conditions-and-drought/key-research/drought-under-climate-change.\nAdditional data available by request by contacting seasonal.conditions@dpird.nsw.gov.au",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Sydney - Haymarket - The Rocks) with SA2 code (11337).\nBuildings is a spatial dataset which represents Australia's built environment derived from remotely sensed imagery and aggregated data sources. The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Sydney - Haymarket - The Rocks SA2 by AURIN.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a13.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "*Fires in Australia’s Forests 2011–16 (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof the extent and frequency of planned and unplanned fires occurring in\r\nforest in the five financial years between July 2011 and June 2016,\r\nassembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was\r\ndeveloped from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and\r\nterritory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest\r\nFire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest\r\ncover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018, \r\nand forest tenure information sourced from the *Tenure of Australia’s\r\nForests (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a\r\nfinancial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event\r\noccurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is\r\nrecorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into\r\ntwo categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and\r\nadvice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe *Fires in Australia’s forests 2011–16 (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is provided as part of the five-yearly Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "title": "Agricultural commodities: March quarter 2017",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n The March edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities to 2021-22. \r\n The outlook will be an important focal point at the conference and underpin many presentations delivered by ABARES speakers at the conference. \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts, as well as articles on the EU sheep meat industry; farm performance of broadacre and dairy farms; productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries; and disaggregating farm performance by size. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8.3 per cent to a record $63.8 billion in 2016-17 before easing by 3.9 per cent to a forecast $61.3 billion in 2017-18. Despite the forecast decline, the gross value of farm production in 2017-18 would be 17.3 per cent higher than the average of $52.3 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 4.4 per cent to $31.2 billion in 2017-18, following a forecast decrease of 2.6 per cent in 2016-17. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of livestock production in 2017-18 would be around 28 per cent higher than the average of $24.4 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to decrease by 11.3 per cent to $30 billion in 2017-18, after a forecast increase of 20.2 per cent in 2016-17. The decrease follows record production of wheat and barley in 2016-17, which resulted from favourable seasonal conditions during winter and spring. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of crop production in 2017-18 would be around 8 per cent higher than the average of $27.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• In 2021-22 the gross value of farm production is projected to be around $59.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8.6 per cent higher than the average of $54.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 (also in 2016-17 dollars). In 2021-22 the gross value of crop production is projected to be around $29.0 billion and the gross value of livestock production is projected to be around $30.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars). \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $48.7 billion in 2017-18, higher than the forecast $47.7 billion in 2016-17. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2017-18 are beef and veal (up 1 per cent), wool (10 per cent), dairy products (11 per cent), sugar (10 per cent), cotton (35 per cent), wine (5 per cent), lamb (3 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (4 per cent), rock lobster (6 per cent) and mutton (1 per cent). \r\n• Forecast increases in 2017-18 are expected to be partly offset by expected declines in export earnings for wheat (down 9 per cent), coarse grains (11 per cent), canola (6 per cent) and chickpeas (42 per cent). \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of wool, dairy products, sugar, wine, lamb, barley, canola, rock lobster and mutton are forecast to increase in 2017-18. Export prices for cotton and chickpeas are forecast to fall. Prices for beef and veal, wheat and live feeder/slaughter cattle are forecast to remain around the same as in 2016-17. \r\n• In 2021-22 the value of farm exports is projected to be around $46.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8 per cent higher than the average of $43.1 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• The value of crop exports is projected to be $24.9 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 7 per cent higher than the average of $23.2 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. The value of livestock exports is projected to be $21.8 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 10 per cent higher than the average of $19.8 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 2.3 per cent in 2017-18 to $1.5 billion, after decreasing by a forecast 3.4 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 3.3 per cent in 2017 and 3.4 per cent in 2018. Growth is expected to rise further to around 3.5 per cent in 2019 before declining to 3.4 per cent in 2021 and 3.3 per cent in 2022. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.8 per cent in 2017-18. Over the medium term to 2021-22, economic growth is assumed to average around 3 per cent. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2017-18, slightly lower than the forecast average of US75 cents in 2016-17. It is assumed to appreciate slightly over the medium term, reaching US74 cents towards 2021-22. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n The EU sheep meat industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers of sheep meat. Imports are controlled by import quotas and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• Australia is the second largest exporter to the European Union, behind New Zealand, although its allocated quota is just 8 per cent that of New Zealand's. \r\n• As a high value market for sheep meat, expanding sheep meat exports to the European Union would benefit the Australian industry. However, until the trade outcomes of Brexit are known, opportunities for Australian sheep meat exporters are uncertain. \r\n\r\n Farm performance: broadacre and dairy farms, 2014-15 to 2016-17  \r\n• In 2016-17 farm cash income for Australian broadacre farms is projected to average $216,000 a farm, the highest recorded in the past 20 years. \r\n• Record broadacre farm cash incomes this year are the result of near record winter grain production in most regions and good prices for beef cattle, sheep, lamb and wool. \r\n• Average farm cash income is projected to increase for broadacre farms in all states except Tasmania in 2016-17. \r\n• Farm cash income for dairy farms is projected to decline by 17 per cent nationally to an average of $105,000 a farm in 2016-17, reflecting lower average farmgate milk prices and reduced milk production. \r\n\r\n Productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries  \r\n• From 1977-78 to 2014-15, productivity in the broadacre industries averaged 1.1 per cent a year as a result of declining input use (down 1 per cent a year) and modest output growth (up 0.1 per cent a year). \r\n• In the dairy industry, productivity growth averaged 1.5 per cent a year between 1978-79 and 2014-15. This reflected average annual growth of 1.3 per cent in output and an average annual decline of 0.2 per cent in input use. \r\n\r\n Disaggregating farm performance by size  \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms produced 46 per cent of total output, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms produced 12 per cent of total output. \r\n• The average rate of return, including capital appreciation, generated by the largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms was 8.2 per cent, while the smallest 10 per cent generated average returns of -2.8 per cent. \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms had the lowest average equity ratio of all farms (79 per cent), while the smallest 10 per cent of farms had the highest average equity ratio (97 per cent). \r\n",

    "description": "Future Melbourne Community Plan is the City of Melbourne’s premier planning document. It outlines a plan to grow Melbourne as a global, liveable, and sustainable city. The City of Melbourne accepted responsibility for monitoring the Future Melbourne indicators over the ten years from 2008 and reporting outcomes to Melbourne City Council, the public and City of Melbourne administration. City of Melbourne has commenced a review of the Future Melbourne 2008 plan this year with a view to writing a renewed Future Melbourne 2016-26 plan.\n\n\n\nTo be able to track Melbourne’s progress according to the aims set out in the Future Melbourne 2008 Plan, City of Melbourne developed and indicators framework including indicators for personal wellbeing and social connection, derived from the Australian Unity wellbeing survey. Australian Unity and the Australian Centre on Quality of Life at Deakin University have conducted national bi-annual population surveys for the last ten years and created an index of perceived wellbeing for the Australian population, including the population of Melbourne. Both organisations support the Index being used and developed as a scientific tool and encourage investigations into the usefulness of the Index by others.\n\n\n\nCity of Melbourne annually collects data on the personal wellbeing, social connection, self-reported health, volunteering behaviour, food security, acceptance of diverse cultures; engagement in decision making and arts and cultural activities of residents in Melbourne Local Government Area. To achieve this City of Melbourne commissioned a survey of 400 respondents.",

The Census collects information on students and staff from all non-government establishments that have, as their major activity, the administration or provision of full-time primary, secondary and/or special education. \nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - Downloadable Data Files.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Queensland Department of Education - State and Non State School Listings 2012-2018.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nFrom 2015, students enrolled at state schools are recorded against their age or ability appropriate year level as determined by their school.\n\n\nFrom 2015, Year 7 became the first year of secondary school in Queensland.\n\n\nA half cohort of Prep Year was introduced in 2007 to align with the shift in the compulsory school starting age from 2008. In 2017 the half cohort is in Year 10.\n\n\nThe school structure in this data is as at August 2017; historical data has been combined for schools which have been amalgamated. For this reason, schools which were created by an amalgamation may have enrolments for years prior to opening.\n\n\nThe number of schools in this data may differ from the school count cube because there are a small number of schools which do not have enrolments of their own; rather students from other schools attend these schools on an as needs basis. The Lady Cilento Children's Hospital School does not have enrolments of their own.\n\n",

    "description": "\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (related waterbodies) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

    "title": "Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017",
    "description": "##This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at September 2017. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update May 2016 released in June 2016. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the May 2016 version: Desert Channels and Mackay-Whitsundays natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland; the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges NRM region in South Australia (extending into part of the Murray-Darling Basin NRM region); the state of New South Wales; the state of Victoria; the state of Tasmania; the state of Western Australia; and the Northern Territory. The capital city of Adelaide was also updated using 2016 mesh block information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This equates to over 585 million hectares or 76% of Australia, the largest update of catchment scale land use mapping to date. \r\n\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. Users should also note that it is not possible to calculate land use change statistics between annual CLUM national compilations as not all regions are updated each year; land use mapping methodologies, precision, accuracy and source data (in particular satellite imagery) have improved over the years; and the land use classification has changed over time. In particular, the major differences between this September 2017 version and the May 2016 version are:\r\n\r\n* The September 2017 version has been mapped to version 8 of the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification (released in October 2016)\r\n* Improvements to the Western Australia mapping including improved mapping of native forests, conservation areas, topographic features, horticulture and intensive animal production\r\n* Changes to the mapping of native and modified pastures in New South Wales\r\n* Changes to the mapping of dairies in Tasmania so that only the dairy infrastructure is mapped as dairies and the dairy pastures are mapped as modified pastures.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to calculate change when earlier land use datasets have been revised and corrected to ensure that changes detected are real change and not an artefact of the mapping process. The Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) have done this on an NRM regions basis for Queensland and can be accessed at:\r\n\r\n* Data: Search the Queensland Spatial Catalogue (http://dds.information.qld.gov.au/dds/) for \"Land Use Mapping\"\r\n* Reports: https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/vegetation/mapping/qlump-reports.\r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). As a seamless spatial dataset for Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as irrigated horticulture and dryland cropping) and more specific land use categories such as grapes, cotton, cereals, sugar and tree fruits. These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Australia. A complementary dataset Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017 provides commodity level mapping as a vector dataset. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of catchment scale mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The date of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. The most current mapping occurs in intensive agricultural areas; older mapping generally occurs in the semi-arid and pastoral zones. \r\nThe primary classes of land use in the ALUM Classification are:\r\n \r\n1. Conservation and natural environments - land used primarily for conservation purposes, based on maintaining the essentially natural ecosystems present\r\n2. Production from relatively natural environments - land used mainly for primary production with limited change to the native vegetation\r\n3. Production from dryland agriculture and plantations - land used mainly for primary production based on dryland farming systems\r\n4. Production from irrigated agriculture and plantations - land used mostly for primary production based on irrigated farming\r\n5. Intensive uses - land subject to extensive modification, generally in association with closer residential settlement, commercial or industrial uses\r\n6. Water - water features (water is regarded as an essential aspect of the classification, even though it is primarily a land cover type, not a land use)\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). ACLUMP, of which ABARES is a partner, promotes the development of consistent information on land use and land management practices. This consortium of Australian, state and territory government partners is critical to providing nationally consistent land use mapping at both catchment and national scale, underpinned by common technical standards including an agreed national land use classification. ACLUMP provides a national land use data directory and the maintenance of land use datasets on Australian and state government data repositories.

The other HF ocean radar station is at Fremantle.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe GUI HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 230 deg true east of north (approximately south-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

The lightest 18O value (-2.99ppt) is recorded during the Holocene (~5cm depth) while the LGM (~125cm depth) is positioned at the heaviest 18O value of -0.59ppt. Once the estimated ice volume effect has been accounted for, this still leaves a substantial difference in 18O which must be accounted for through significant changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) or salinity. The 13C record ranges from a minimum at approximately 8500 yrs BP of 0.16ppt to a maximum value of 1.31ppt during MIS 3.",

    "description": "All government primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have school zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas).\nSchool zones were produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nSchool zones defined as metropolitan have taken preference over school zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of school zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some school zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website.\nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

The site depth is 469 m.\n\nIt is one of four regional shelf moorings located in the Timor Sea, extending from the Timor Trough to Joseph Bonaparte Gulf. These moorings comprise the Indonesian Throughflow array, which was deployed in June 2011. This is an important first step in the enhanced monitoring of northern Australian waters.  These shelf moorings complement the three deep-water moorings deployed in the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait to monitor inter-basin Indian-Pacific Ocean exchange.\n\nProcessed data from the first two deployments (Jun 2010 and Jan 2011) are now available.",

The Gate point layer is only indicative for locked gates and the information is not always kept up to date therefore regard all gates as locked for safety reasons.\n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially.   The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes.  The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS.  The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field.  AMS is also set up to be used by other OEH Divisions eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\n\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point.\nDetailed documentation is available including:\n-  Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets)\n-  Data Model\n-  Business Rules\n-  Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed.  Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

    "title": "Lessons from the water market: The southern Murray-Darling Basin water allocation market 2000-01 to 2015-16",
    "description": "ABARES Lessons from the water market report analyses trends in water allocation prices in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), between 2000-01 and 2015-16. This report analyses the major demand and supply side drivers of water allocation prices in the sMDB, drawing on historical data for 2000-01 to 2015-16. The study disentangles the effects of climate variability (rainfall, water storage and allocation volumes) from the key policy changes (including Commonwealth purchase of entitlements for the environment) and irrigation sector changes that have occurred during the period. \r\n\r\nKey Issues • The main driver of change in water prices over this period has been variation in rainfall, storages and allocations. During the peak of the drought water prices jumped to more than $1 000 per ML, before dropping to near zero during the flood years (2010-11 and 2011-12). Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, storage volumes steadily decreased and prices steadily increased. \r\n• However, ABARES finds that even after controlling for these dry conditions, market prices during 2014-15 and 2015-16 were higher than expected from past experience. The report finds that these higher prices can be explained by a combination of demand and supply factors including: Commonwealth entitlement purchases, state carryover rule changes, interregional trade restrictions and commodity price fluctuations and irrigation land-use changes. \r\n• While Commonwealth entitlement purchases reduce the supply of water and have an upward effect on prices, these are offset to some extent by Commonwealth investments in water saving infrastructure. Further, even if water savings are ignored, Commonwealth entitlement purchases offer only a partial explanation for the increase in water prices. \r\n• Another important factor has been changes to carryover rules particularly in Victoria, which have led to large increases in carryover volumes since 2007-08. This increase carryover since 2007-08 has contributed to higher allocation prices in the market. Despite this, carryover remains a positive development that will benefit irrigators in the long run by keeping prices lower in drought years. \r\n",

This region includes the Port Phillip Bay and Western\nPort coastlines. Points are captured to show the indicative location of the\nendpoint for a waterway or channel as geographic coordinates.\nThe data table includes minimal attributes to assist in\nidentifying the feature.\nData was created using the waterway (Reach) layer from original FIS\n1:50K (Vicmap Hydro) streams data set, which included only those waterways\nwithin catchments of greater than 60ha. Waterways (Reach) Rectification project\nundertaken 2001 to 2003 to review and correct the extent of the waterways reach\nnetwork to ensure a complete data set exists (using the Drainage Metropolis\nBoundary, 50K data, 1:2500 Drainage Record Plans, Drainage Limits data,\northophotos, as constructed and/or design drawings, contour data and Melway\nStreet Directory). Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in\nGIS and AMIS for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for\nstart / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length\nthat are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated\nin 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10\nusing Lidar survey data (contours). Data is maintained using Lidar survey data\n(contours) and 60 ha limits.

    "description": "<b>Oct 2024 Minor Amendment No.3</b>\n(Zone Map Dataset 2 of 5, needs to be used in conjunction with Zones, Local plan boundary, Local plan precincts and North Lakes Locality datasets).\nThe Zoning Map is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of distinct clients to alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) by treatment type. The AODTS data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the client was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment type refers to the type of activity used to treat the client's alcohol or other drug problem. Main treatment type is the principal activity that is determined at assessment by the treatment provider to be necessary for the completion of the treatment plan for the client's alcohol or other drug problem for their principal drug of concern. One main treatment type is reported for each treatment episode.\n\n\nAssessment only, support and case management only, and information and education only can only be reported as main treatment types. The AODTS NMDS also collects data on a client's other treatment types; however this variable is not included the data.\n\n\nDue to the nuances of data collection systems in Western Australia and Victoria, caution should be used when comparing the reported number of episodes by main treatment type in these states' PHNs to others. Western Australia's and Victoria's data collection systems do not collect an additional treatment type. Instead, a new treatment episode is opened for any additional treatment a client receives, and the additional treatment is recorded as the main treatment. This may inflate the reported number of episodes provides in the collection year.\n\n",

    "description": "We propose an investigation of pulsars with interpulse (IP) emissions using the Ultra-wide-bandwidth Low (UWL) receiver at the Parkes (Murriyang) telescope. We aim to explore the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through the application of the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained across a wide bandwidth spanning 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. Emission heights will be measured using both the delay-radius and geometrical\n  methods to examine their frequency dependence and test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of different profile components will be conducted to constrain pulsar emission properties, while pulse intensity modulations will be analyzed to identify potential phase-lock phenomena. Our study will provide more information on the understanding of the properties of pulsars with IP emissions.",

    "description": "NSW Tenancy laws say how residential tenancy agreements can be ended. Tenancies are usually terminated by the tenant, landlord, the landlord's agent, or by a Tribunal order. Fair Trading conducts an end-of tenancy survey to collect data about how and why tenancies end. This survey was designed to help Fair Trading to better understand the renting experience to help inform future tenancy reforms. The current survey commenced on 2 August 2021.\nThe survey process\nEvery principal tenant and landlord or nominated agent is asked to complete a survey when a bond claim is finalised through an online bonds system. Survey invitations are sent by email and participation is voluntary. Individual responses are kept anonymous.\nFair Trading initially conducted a pilot survey in 2019/2020. Results from that survey informed the current ongoing end of tenancy survey. \nThe end of tenancy survey \nThe survey data is collected quarterly, and is available to download for use by the community, research, business and industry.\nTo mitigate re-identification risks, postcode information has been removed and response dates grouped into months.\nIt should be noted that the representativeness of the survey data is limited, including because:\n*  participation is voluntary\n*  the survey only includes respondents who used Rental Bonds Online to lodge and claim their rental bond, so the sample does not extend to all terminated tenancies\n*  no demographic information is collected\n*  some tenancies had duplicate responses\n*  domestic violence victims may also self-select out of completing such a survey, given their vulnerability and the difficult circumstances they may experience after ending a tenancy.\n*  The survey commenced in August 2021",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2011.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the measurement of Secchi Depth and Total suspended solids (inorganic and organic components) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling.\n\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\n\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\n\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\n\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\n\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

The term 'patched' means that if on any day a station does not have an observation then the gap in the record is 'patched' (ie. filled) with an estimate obtained by spatial interpolation of the daily data from surrounding stations. Consequently the Patched Point Data for a given location always contain a complete data record, or in other words, there are no missing data.",

    "description": "This proposal aims to constrain burst rates and spin down properties of a sample of new Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) discovered with the ASKAP CRAFT Coherent upgrade (CRACO) system. Over the past 12-months of commissioning, CRACO discovered and precisely localised 15 new RRATs, characterised by their sporadic pulses with dispersion measures (DM) consistent with Galactic sources. We request 22.5h of Parkes time split into three 30min observations spanning 6-months for each target. This can help constrain periods and potentially phase-coherent timing solutions given that we already have arcsec-precision interferometric localisations. Our main science goals are: 1) to measure their burst rates, periods, and spin-down properties; 2) to assess their nulling fraction and intermittency; 3) to measure their polarimetric properties and constrain their emission mechanism; 4) to determine if the CRACO RRATs are fundamentally different from the known RRAT population. Some of these goals can be answered even with the detection of a limited number of pulses.",

See more information here.\n\nEach row contains information about the restrictions that apply to one parking bay. Each restriction consists of a set of columns:\n\nHow the data joins:\nThere are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions. \nThe way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don’t currently join.\n\nField information:\n- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)\n- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive. (1-5=Monday to Friday)\n- StartTime: The time each day when the restriction applies.\n- EndTime: The time each day when the restriction ends.\n- TypeDesc: The type of restriction. Eg: \"2P Meter\" (two hour parking, paid for using a meter), \"Disabled Only\" (only vehicles with disabiled permits can park).\n- Description: A compact, human-readable description of the overall restrictions. TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces\n- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).\n- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\n\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times. Each restriction is a set of columns with a number: FromDay1, ToDay1, StartTime1, EndTime1, etc.\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhile all due care has been taken to ensure the data of this website is accurate, current and available please note: \n·         there may be errors or omission in it\n·         there may be occasions where the data is not available and/or the website will be unavailable. \n\nThe City of Melbourne and its employees accept no responsibility for any loss, damage, claim, expense, cost or liability whatsoever (including in contract, tort including negligence, pursuant to statue and otherwise) arising in respect of or in connection with accessing, using or reliance upon the data in this website, or the unavailability of the data or the website.",

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "This dataset identifies the Management Areas declared under the Waterways Conservation Act 1976.\n\nUnder the Waterways Conservation Act 1976, the Minister for Water and the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation have responsibility for the conservation of the waters and associated land in five declared Management Areas. The declared Management Areas are Albany waterways, Avon River, Wilson Inlet, Peel Inlet and Leschenault Inlet.\n\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation has an approval process for certain works affecting waterways and foreshore areas and can provide advice on other developments affecting, or likely to affect, the condition and public amenity of these \nwaterways.\n\nKey aspects of the Act relate to protecting and managing the condition and amenity of waterways when there are disturbance activities within or adjacent to the Management Areas. Activities within or adjacent to the Management Area that should be referred to the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation for discussion or licensing include:\n<ul>\n<li>changes or intensification of land use adjacent to or impacting on waterways or their foreshore areas (e.g. land planning, development, mining, mineral exploration, drainage or flood risk management proposals)</li>\n<li>dredging, reclamation, dewatering, drainage and construction activities including retaining walls, jetties, private boat ramps or public facilities</li>\n<li>other activities that may affect declared management areas, for example, those that may increase nutrients.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFurther information and advice can be sought from Department of Water and Environmental Regulation's regional offices. Contact information for regional offices is available at the Department of Water website.",
