    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to compile this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. The dataset was developed to assist in the classification of permanent waterholes in the Cooper GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe dataset contains two shapefiles. The first (COO_Lakes_WH_WFS.shp) contains all the lakes and waterholes identified in the 250K topo maps and uses the Water Observations From Space dataset to find the pixel within each polygon that has the maximum proportion of time inundated (MAX field). Waterholes that are inundated more than 70% of the time (MAX>0.70) are considered to be semi-permanent, those that are inundated more than 95% (MAX>0.95) are considered to be permanent. The second dataset (perm_WH_DTWT.shp) is looking at the depth to water table beneath waterholes. There are no dedicated observation bore networks to look at groundwater levels beneath waterholes so this dataset is using the closest water level observation up to a maximum of 5 km away. The field NEAR_DIST is the distance of the bore from the waterhole and the field WH_DTWT is the  depth to water table below the waterhole assuming that the groundwater level is the same as that in the borehole within 5 km. A positive value in WH_DTWT means that the groundwater level is below the water level of the waterhole, a negative value means that the groundwater level is above the water level of the water hole.",

The survey was funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin accounts for about three-quarters of Australia's citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit production with a large percentage of these crops grown in the southern Basin. \r\n",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nThe Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2020) is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management and co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the same as the previously published Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2020) (released 03 December 2020) but with an amended title that more accurately reflects the full extent of the dataset.\r\n\r\nIt was developed from multiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets related to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous land dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the Forests of Australia (2018) dataset.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of final datasets. The following attributes are applied in this dataset:\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous owned__: Freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land and forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: Land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: Land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan.\r\n\r\n* __Other special rights__: Land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements and legislated special cultural use provisions.\r\n\r\nIn this dataset, the attributes of Indigenous ownership, Indigenous management or co-management, and other special rights are applied separately. The dataset structure therefore differs from Indigenous estate datasets published by ABARES in 2018 or earlier.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a13.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "*Fires in Australia’s Forests 2011–16 (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof the extent and frequency of planned and unplanned fires occurring in\r\nforest in the five financial years between July 2011 and June 2016,\r\nassembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was\r\ndeveloped from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and\r\nterritory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest\r\nFire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest\r\ncover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018, \r\nand forest tenure information sourced from the *Tenure of Australia’s\r\nForests (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a\r\nfinancial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event\r\noccurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is\r\nrecorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into\r\ntwo categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and\r\nadvice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe *Fires in Australia’s forests 2011–16 (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is provided as part of the five-yearly Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n The March edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities to 2021-22. \r\n The outlook will be an important focal point at the conference and underpin many presentations delivered by ABARES speakers at the conference. \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts, as well as articles on the EU sheep meat industry; farm performance of broadacre and dairy farms; productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries; and disaggregating farm performance by size. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8.3 per cent to a record $63.8 billion in 2016-17 before easing by 3.9 per cent to a forecast $61.3 billion in 2017-18. Despite the forecast decline, the gross value of farm production in 2017-18 would be 17.3 per cent higher than the average of $52.3 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 4.4 per cent to $31.2 billion in 2017-18, following a forecast decrease of 2.6 per cent in 2016-17. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of livestock production in 2017-18 would be around 28 per cent higher than the average of $24.4 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to decrease by 11.3 per cent to $30 billion in 2017-18, after a forecast increase of 20.2 per cent in 2016-17. The decrease follows record production of wheat and barley in 2016-17, which resulted from favourable seasonal conditions during winter and spring. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of crop production in 2017-18 would be around 8 per cent higher than the average of $27.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• In 2021-22 the gross value of farm production is projected to be around $59.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8.6 per cent higher than the average of $54.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 (also in 2016-17 dollars). In 2021-22 the gross value of crop production is projected to be around $29.0 billion and the gross value of livestock production is projected to be around $30.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars). \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $48.7 billion in 2017-18, higher than the forecast $47.7 billion in 2016-17. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2017-18 are beef and veal (up 1 per cent), wool (10 per cent), dairy products (11 per cent), sugar (10 per cent), cotton (35 per cent), wine (5 per cent), lamb (3 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (4 per cent), rock lobster (6 per cent) and mutton (1 per cent). \r\n• Forecast increases in 2017-18 are expected to be partly offset by expected declines in export earnings for wheat (down 9 per cent), coarse grains (11 per cent), canola (6 per cent) and chickpeas (42 per cent). \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of wool, dairy products, sugar, wine, lamb, barley, canola, rock lobster and mutton are forecast to increase in 2017-18. Export prices for cotton and chickpeas are forecast to fall. Prices for beef and veal, wheat and live feeder/slaughter cattle are forecast to remain around the same as in 2016-17. \r\n• In 2021-22 the value of farm exports is projected to be around $46.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8 per cent higher than the average of $43.1 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• The value of crop exports is projected to be $24.9 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 7 per cent higher than the average of $23.2 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. The value of livestock exports is projected to be $21.8 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 10 per cent higher than the average of $19.8 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 2.3 per cent in 2017-18 to $1.5 billion, after decreasing by a forecast 3.4 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 3.3 per cent in 2017 and 3.4 per cent in 2018. Growth is expected to rise further to around 3.5 per cent in 2019 before declining to 3.4 per cent in 2021 and 3.3 per cent in 2022. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.8 per cent in 2017-18. Over the medium term to 2021-22, economic growth is assumed to average around 3 per cent. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2017-18, slightly lower than the forecast average of US75 cents in 2016-17. It is assumed to appreciate slightly over the medium term, reaching US74 cents towards 2021-22. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n The EU sheep meat industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers of sheep meat. Imports are controlled by import quotas and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• Australia is the second largest exporter to the European Union, behind New Zealand, although its allocated quota is just 8 per cent that of New Zealand's. \r\n• As a high value market for sheep meat, expanding sheep meat exports to the European Union would benefit the Australian industry. However, until the trade outcomes of Brexit are known, opportunities for Australian sheep meat exporters are uncertain. \r\n\r\n Farm performance: broadacre and dairy farms, 2014-15 to 2016-17  \r\n• In 2016-17 farm cash income for Australian broadacre farms is projected to average $216,000 a farm, the highest recorded in the past 20 years. \r\n• Record broadacre farm cash incomes this year are the result of near record winter grain production in most regions and good prices for beef cattle, sheep, lamb and wool. \r\n• Average farm cash income is projected to increase for broadacre farms in all states except Tasmania in 2016-17. \r\n• Farm cash income for dairy farms is projected to decline by 17 per cent nationally to an average of $105,000 a farm in 2016-17, reflecting lower average farmgate milk prices and reduced milk production. \r\n\r\n Productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries  \r\n• From 1977-78 to 2014-15, productivity in the broadacre industries averaged 1.1 per cent a year as a result of declining input use (down 1 per cent a year) and modest output growth (up 0.1 per cent a year). \r\n• In the dairy industry, productivity growth averaged 1.5 per cent a year between 1978-79 and 2014-15. This reflected average annual growth of 1.3 per cent in output and an average annual decline of 0.2 per cent in input use. \r\n\r\n Disaggregating farm performance by size  \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms produced 46 per cent of total output, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms produced 12 per cent of total output. \r\n• The average rate of return, including capital appreciation, generated by the largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms was 8.2 per cent, while the smallest 10 per cent generated average returns of -2.8 per cent. \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms had the lowest average equity ratio of all farms (79 per cent), while the smallest 10 per cent of farms had the highest average equity ratio (97 per cent). \r\n",

    "description": "\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (related waterbodies) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70°E to 170°W, 20°N to 70°S.  Only night time passes are included in the product. Each grid cell contains the 1 night average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR productsMatchups with buoy SST observations (adjusted to skin depths) indicate typical 2014 biases of &lt; 0.05 degC and standard deviations of 0.5 degC to 0.6 degC for NOAA-18 and NOAA-19.  Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.",

    "title": "Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017",
    "description": "##This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at September 2017. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update May 2016 released in June 2016. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the May 2016 version: Desert Channels and Mackay-Whitsundays natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland; the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges NRM region in South Australia (extending into part of the Murray-Darling Basin NRM region); the state of New South Wales; the state of Victoria; the state of Tasmania; the state of Western Australia; and the Northern Territory. The capital city of Adelaide was also updated using 2016 mesh block information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This equates to over 585 million hectares or 76% of Australia, the largest update of catchment scale land use mapping to date. \r\n\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. Users should also note that it is not possible to calculate land use change statistics between annual CLUM national compilations as not all regions are updated each year; land use mapping methodologies, precision, accuracy and source data (in particular satellite imagery) have improved over the years; and the land use classification has changed over time. In particular, the major differences between this September 2017 version and the May 2016 version are:\r\n\r\n* The September 2017 version has been mapped to version 8 of the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification (released in October 2016)\r\n* Improvements to the Western Australia mapping including improved mapping of native forests, conservation areas, topographic features, horticulture and intensive animal production\r\n* Changes to the mapping of native and modified pastures in New South Wales\r\n* Changes to the mapping of dairies in Tasmania so that only the dairy infrastructure is mapped as dairies and the dairy pastures are mapped as modified pastures.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to calculate change when earlier land use datasets have been revised and corrected to ensure that changes detected are real change and not an artefact of the mapping process. The Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) have done this on an NRM regions basis for Queensland and can be accessed at:\r\n\r\n* Data: Search the Queensland Spatial Catalogue (http://dds.information.qld.gov.au/dds/) for \"Land Use Mapping\"\r\n* Reports: https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/vegetation/mapping/qlump-reports.\r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). As a seamless spatial dataset for Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as irrigated horticulture and dryland cropping) and more specific land use categories such as grapes, cotton, cereals, sugar and tree fruits. These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Australia. A complementary dataset Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017 provides commodity level mapping as a vector dataset. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of catchment scale mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The date of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. The most current mapping occurs in intensive agricultural areas; older mapping generally occurs in the semi-arid and pastoral zones. \r\nThe primary classes of land use in the ALUM Classification are:\r\n \r\n1. Conservation and natural environments - land used primarily for conservation purposes, based on maintaining the essentially natural ecosystems present\r\n2. Production from relatively natural environments - land used mainly for primary production with limited change to the native vegetation\r\n3. Production from dryland agriculture and plantations - land used mainly for primary production based on dryland farming systems\r\n4. Production from irrigated agriculture and plantations - land used mostly for primary production based on irrigated farming\r\n5. Intensive uses - land subject to extensive modification, generally in association with closer residential settlement, commercial or industrial uses\r\n6. Water - water features (water is regarded as an essential aspect of the classification, even though it is primarily a land cover type, not a land use)\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). ACLUMP, of which ABARES is a partner, promotes the development of consistent information on land use and land management practices. This consortium of Australian, state and territory government partners is critical to providing nationally consistent land use mapping at both catchment and national scale, underpinned by common technical standards including an agreed national land use classification. ACLUMP provides a national land use data directory and the maintenance of land use datasets on Australian and state government data repositories.

    "description": "This short core obtained off Sumatra (BAR9403, 5.82 S, 104.0316 E) records the palaeoceanography from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present day. The lightest 18O value (-2.99ppt) is recorded during the Holocene (~5cm depth) while the LGM (~125cm depth) is positioned at the heaviest 18O value of -0.59ppt. Once the estimated ice volume effect has been accounted for, this still leaves a substantial difference in 18O which must be accounted for through significant changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) or salinity. The 13C record ranges from a minimum at approximately 8500 yrs BP of 0.16ppt to a maximum value of 1.31ppt during MIS 3.",

    "description": "ABARES Lessons from the water market report analyses trends in water allocation prices in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), between 2000-01 and 2015-16. This report analyses the major demand and supply side drivers of water allocation prices in the sMDB, drawing on historical data for 2000-01 to 2015-16. The study disentangles the effects of climate variability (rainfall, water storage and allocation volumes) from the key policy changes (including Commonwealth purchase of entitlements for the environment) and irrigation sector changes that have occurred during the period. \r\n\r\nKey Issues • The main driver of change in water prices over this period has been variation in rainfall, storages and allocations. During the peak of the drought water prices jumped to more than $1 000 per ML, before dropping to near zero during the flood years (2010-11 and 2011-12). Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, storage volumes steadily decreased and prices steadily increased. \r\n• However, ABARES finds that even after controlling for these dry conditions, market prices during 2014-15 and 2015-16 were higher than expected from past experience. The report finds that these higher prices can be explained by a combination of demand and supply factors including: Commonwealth entitlement purchases, state carryover rule changes, interregional trade restrictions and commodity price fluctuations and irrigation land-use changes. \r\n• While Commonwealth entitlement purchases reduce the supply of water and have an upward effect on prices, these are offset to some extent by Commonwealth investments in water saving infrastructure. Further, even if water savings are ignored, Commonwealth entitlement purchases offer only a partial explanation for the increase in water prices. \r\n• Another important factor has been changes to carryover rules particularly in Victoria, which have led to large increases in carryover volumes since 2007-08. This increase carryover since 2007-08 has contributed to higher allocation prices in the market. Despite this, carryover remains a positive development that will benefit irrigators in the long run by keeping prices lower in drought years. \r\n",

The data covers migrating settlers with a Date of Settlement between 01/07/2020 and 30/06/2021. The location data is aggregated based on the Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries of the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data in this dataset are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit Data.gov.au.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data with the 2011 LGA boundaries of the ABS Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC). Where the recorded number of settlers is less than 5 (\"&lt;5\" in the original table), it has been set to 4 for confidentiality.",

Georeferenced TIF image of the magentics of the Beetaloo Sub-basin and adjacent area.  Total magnetic intensity (TMI) data measures variations in the intensity of the Earth magnetic field caused by the contrasting content of rock-forming minerals in the Earths crust. Magnetic anomalies can be either positive (field stronger than normal) or negative (field weaker) depending on the susceptibility of the rock. The 2015 Total magnetic Intensity (TMI) grid of Australia has a grid cell size of ~3 seconds of arc (approximately 80 m). This grid only includes airborne-derived TMI data for onshore and near offshore continental areas.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessments\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset is a clip of the Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) Grid of Australia 2015 (sixth edition) for the area immediately surrounding the Beetaloo GBA region.

    "description": "*Forests of Australia (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation\r\nand land cover data inputs, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as:\r\n\"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single\r\nstem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2021) (unpublished, also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2020), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map as forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nTwenty-seven crabs (13 males, 14 females) were observed on the day after spring tide over several semilunar cycles. Digital photos of the crabs were taken before, during and after low tide. These photographs were examined for any changes in colour or pattern. \n\nUca capricornis do not regularly change their colouration over the course of the day. Of the 27 individuals observed, 24 did not noticeably change their colour, and none altered their pattern.",

    "description": "Measurements of temperature within the snow / firn cover in Wilkes Land East Antarctica were made along the routes of oversnow traverses operating out of Casey (66.6 S 110 E).  In general, measurements were made at a nominal depth of ten metres as a first estimate of mean annual surface temperature of the ice sheet, and for many sites, at some additional depths, typically around twenty metres.  Actual depths of measurements are included with the temperature data as well as date of observation.  No attempt has been made to apply any correction for seasonal or interannual variation.\n\nTwo different methods were used to drill the access holes: an ice coring auger (usually PICO drill, originally SIPRE drill); a steam drill.  In some areas depth of drilling was limited by problems associated with the texture of the firn and difficulties in recovery of material from the hole.\n\nWhere relevant, date of drilling is included with the data, or time elapsed between drilling and temperature measurement.  Temperature measurements were made using 100 ohm platinum resistance elements with resistance measured using a 'Leeds and Northrup' resistance bridge.  The bridge uses a zero/nul measurement technique, thus avoiding heating effects in the sensor Refer quality entry for further details).\n\nThese data form part of the data collected for ASAC projects 456 (Properties and Structure of Antarctic Snow and Ice ), 458 (Characteristics, Dynamics and Mass Budget of the Ice Sheet in Wilkes Land ) and 2224 (Glacier dynamics and mass discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet, 45 degrees -160 degrees E) - ASAC_456, ASAC_458, ASAC_2224).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nsite_id (the marker code of the measurement site)\n\nobservation_date (date on which measurement was made, in ISO8601 format yyyy-mm-dd)\n\nobservation_date_year (year of measurement date)\n\nobservation_date_month (month of measurement date)\n\nobservation_date_day (day of measurement date)\n\ntemperature (degrees C)\n\ndepth_of_observation (m)\n\nlatitude\n\nlongitude\n\ndrill_type\n\ndate_drilled\n\ncomment\n\ndays_between_drilling_and_measurement\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset contains the extent of the coastal zone for the Great Barrier Reef. This extent was identified as the most suitable area to be investigated on land and at sea as part of a conservation planning project looking at coastal development along the GBR coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial part of the coastal zone was initially defined in consultation with stakeholders and included the Queensland Government¿s definition as ¿either: five kilometres from the coastline; or where land first reaches the height of 10 metres Australian Height Datum (AHD), whichever is further from the coast¿ (Queensland Coastal Management Plan). However, the Queensland government definition corresponds to a narrow strip of coastline in most areas and does not encompass most of coastal land uses (and their potential future expansion) that have a significant impact on the marine environmental such as agriculture. In the context of biodiversity conservation and water quality, workshop participants were asked what the coastal zone meant to them. The answers were summarised into four main categories:\r\n1- Intensive coastal-based agriculture,\r\n2- Geomorphological characteristics,\r\n3- Typical coastal vegetation, and\r\n4- Human presence and activities.\r\nThe coastal zone was defined to include all features that would match these four categories, and that also included the Government¿s definition. The marine part of the coastal zone was also defined during this process and the offshore boundary was described as the maximum flood plume extent (secondary flood plume) as in Álvarez-Romero et al. 2013. The extent was smoothed to allow a clear area to be defined. This covers the areas that are have the greatest level of impacts from coastal development, in particular from run-off.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nGBR_coastal_zone.shp (and all associated files as part of the shapefile)\r\nThis dataset contains a polygon that defines the extent of the area identified as the most appropriate coastal zone of the Great Barrier Reef to investigate conservation planning, in particular spatial planning of coastal development to ensure the health for the GBR World Heritage Area.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nÁlvarez-Romero, J.

    "description": "BMT WBM was commissioned by Bankstown City Council to prepare a Flood Study for the Cooks\nRiver stormwater catchment. Similar studies were simultaneously commissioned for the Punchbowl,\nthe Georges Hall, the Lansdowne and the Miller Road stormwater catchments. The location of the\nCooks River stormwater catchment is shown in Figure 1-1.\n\nThe study has been undertaken under the direction of Bankstown City Council and their Floodplain\nManagement Committee. The Committee includes Councillors and Council staff, officers from the\nOffice of Environment &amp; Heritage (OEH), the State Emergency Service and community\nrepresentatives.\nThe study investigates flood behaviour throughout the Cooks River stormwater catchment for existing\ncatchment conditions as at 2012. This includes the analysis of:\n<ul>\n<li>Flows within the underground pipe drainage network; and</li>\n<li>Surface runoff across the catchment.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA two-dimensional computer model was established for the catchment to analyse stormwater flood\nbehaviour under existing catchment conditions. The model provides information on the extent of flood\ninundation, flood depths and flood velocities throughout the catchment for design floods ranging from\nrelatively frequent events to more extreme floods. Full details are outlined in the Cooks River\nCatchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as Appendix C.\n\nResults from this study will form the technical basis for the Floodplain Risk Management Study. The\nFloodplain Risk Management Study will identify areas of high flood risk and investigate options to\nmanage and reduce this risk. Assistance will be sought from the community to help identify these\nareas and to derive appropriate solutions during the subsequent study.\n\nThe flood model developed during this study will provide Council with a valuable tool to assess the\nfuture development in the catchment.\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all public drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Indicative information on drainage asset performance for various storm events;</li>\n<li>A property database including surveyed floor levels, flood levels and the resulting floor level\nimmunity, expressed in the magnitude of a storm event;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood behaviour due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This technical report estimates the responsiveness of demand for structural pine to changes in timber and steel prices. Measures of demand responsiveness can provide valuable insights into the potential implications of changes in policy or market settings on volumes and prices received by producers. The analysis focuses on estimating short-term price elasticities of demand--a formal measure of the sensitivity of demand--to changes in prices in the same quarter or recent past. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The estimates in this report suggest that the importance of timber and steel prices on the quantity of structural timber demanded in the short-run is limited. However, the volume of residential construction activity was found to have a substantial effect for demand of domestically produced structural pine products. In particular, new house commencements explain a great deal of the quarter-on-quarter changes in the quantity of domestic structural pine sales. This confirms the common assertion by industry that house commencements are the primary driver for structural timber demand within Australia. \r\n\r\n Looking forward, changes in consumer preferences, socio-demographic trends and building regulations will likely play a much greater role in the choice of building materials used in housing construction compared with timber and steel prices. Trends suggest consumers are placing more weight on the environmental benefits of structural materials. Changing architectural styles will change the material requirements for a standard home. A global trend towards higher-density living will likely promote a shift toward multi-unit buildings, with recent changes to the National Construction Code opening the way for increased timber use in the midrise construction market, leading to greater timber use in multi-level buildings. \r\n",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps\">riverine flooding</a> in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nSee some <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information\">frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding</a>.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1. Is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.\n 2. Has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses.\n 3. Is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which:\n   - May involve unstable and/or unpredictable variables and is therefore limited in its accuracy and applicability; and,\n   - Will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.\n\n 4. Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n 5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n 6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n\nAccordingly:\n\n 1. While the information presented on this website attempts to represent what may be experienced during a flood, actual flood events may differ substantially.\n\n 2.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Long Beach in the east, to Huskisson in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 7 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

    "title": "IMOS - National Reef Monitoring Network Sub-Facility - Global cryptobenthic fish abundance",
    "description": "The National Reef Monitoring Network brings together shallow reef surveys conducted around Australia into a centralised database. The IMOS National Reef Monitoring Network sub-Facility collates, cleans, stores and makes this data rapidly available from contributors including: Reef Life Survey, Parks Australia, Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia), Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (South Australia), Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales), Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service and Parks Victoria.\n\nThe data provided by the National Reef Monitoring Network contributes to establishing and supporting national marine baselines, and assisting with the management of Commonwealth and State marine reserves. \n\nReef Life Survey (RLS) and the Australian Temperate Reef Network (ATRC) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources by coordinating surveys of rocky and coral reefs using scientific methods, with the ultimate goal to improve coastal stewardship. Our activities depend on the skills of marine scientists, experienced and motivated recreational SCUBA divers, partnerships with management agencies and university researchers, and active input from the ATRC partners and RLS Advisory Committee.\n\nRLS and ATRC data are freely available to the public for non-profit purposes, so not only managers, but also groups such as local dive clubs or schools may use these data to look at changes over time in their own local reefs. By making data freely available and through public outputs, RLS and ATRC aims to raise broader community awareness of the status of Australia's marine biodiversity and associated conservation issues.\n\nThis dataset contains records of cryptobenthic fishes collected by RLS and ATRC divers and partners along 50m transects on shallow rocky and coral reefs using standard methods. Abundance information is available for all species recorded within quantitative survey limits (50 x 1 m swathes either side of the transect line, each distinguished as a 'Block'), with divers searching the reef surface (including cracks) carefully for hidden fishes. These observations are recorded concurrently with the macroinvertebrate observations and together make up the 'Method 2' component of the surveys. For this method, typically one 'Block' is completed per 50 m transect for the program ATRC and 2 blocks are completed for RLS - although exceptions to this rule exist.\n\nThis dataset supersedes the RLS specific \"Reef Life Survey (RLS): Cryptic Fish\" collection that was available at https://catalogue-rls.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?uuid=6a56db3f-d1b2-438d-98c6-bd7dd540a4d5 (provision of data was stopped in June 2021).",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1. Is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.\n 2. Has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses.\n 3. Is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which:\n   - May involve unstable and/or unpredictable variables and is therefore limited in its accuracy and applicability; and,\n   - Will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.\n\n 4. Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n 5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n 6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nAccordingly,\n\n 1. While the information presented on this website attempts to represent what may be experienced during a flood, actual flood events may differ substantially.\n\n 2. This website does not provide a forecast or prediction of future flood events or advice or warnings about floods that may occur in the future or their extent or impact.\n\n 3.

    "description": "These tables present a summary of employment under the Public Service Act 1999 at 31 December 2012 and during the 2012 calendar year. The data is an update of that presented in the APS Statistical Bulletin 2011-12.\r\nData becomes available at six monthly intervals — through this summary for calendar year data and through the annual State of the Service Report (SOSR) and APS Statistical Bulletin (the Bulletin). The data in these tables is sourced from the APS Employment Database (APSED), which contains data extracted from agencies’ HR systems.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Public Service Commission continues to work with agencies to improve the quality and timeliness of the data they provide to APSED. Each year extensive audits and error checking of APSED are undertaken, to ensure that sound conclusions can be drawn from the data. Through this audit process, previously published data has been updated. The June 2012 data published in SOSR and the Bulletin has been revised.\r\n\r\nAs in the Bulletin, a headcount approach is used in these tables—that is, people working part-time are aggregated with people working full-time without weighting. Data also includes inoperative staff. Employees’ classification in these tables refers to their base or substantive classification. Abbreviations used in these tables and changes to administrative arrangements for the period July to December 2012 are explained in the link below. The Explanatory Notes at Appendix 1 of the Bulletin provide definitions of terms used in these tables.\r\nThe Bulletin is available at http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-apsc/parliamentary/aps-statistical-bulletin/snapshots-december-2012",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nAustralia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0, an update of  Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013), is a continental dataset which identifies forested and non-forested land over which Indigenous Australians have legislated use and rights. \r\n\r\n The Indigenous use and rights information was sourced from multiple Indigenous land ownership, land management and land rights datasets from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies. The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset. \r\n\r\n The update was necessary in order to align the forest cover types of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013) and also to introduce an attribute containing forest category information into the dataset. The update had no impact on the Indigenous land management categories reported by the Australia's Indigenous forest estate dataset, and minimal impact on the area of forest types reported against each land management category. \r\n\r\n\tThe  Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0 dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands, and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\n\tThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and SOFR 2013. The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are: 1.\tIndigenous owned and managed; \r\n2.\tIndigenous managed; \r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and \r\n4.\tOther Special rights. \r\n These categories align with the reporting requirements for the NIFS and SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1988. For each day of sampling three resources are provided in the compressed (zipped) folder: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "title": "East Hills Stormwater Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located within the Sydney suburb of East Hills. The study area is a small\nurban catchment centred on the East Hills Railway station, which drains through a\nstormwater pipe network to the Georges River. Much of the study area is also affected by\nflooding from the Georges River, where a series of blockwall “finger levees” have been\nconstructed to reduce flood velocities and the hazard experienced to the occupants of\nriverfront dwellings. The catchment is wholly within the Bankstown local government area.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for some 88 stormwater pits and\n83 stormwater drainage pipelines.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. The stormwater pipe\nnetwork is included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\n\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 4. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study Upper Kedron Sub-Model. This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a17.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "Radiocarbon dating was used to construct an age model for the upper sections of core MD002361 to a depth of 205cm, after which the age-model was based on the chronology of Bassinot et al. as the core extends beyond the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) of SPECMAP. The age versus depth profile for this core shows a step-like pattern with increased sedimentation rates during interglacial periods and decreased rates during glacial periods. The average sedimentation rate over the length of the core is 2.5cm/1000yrs, with a high sedimentation rate illustrated during the holocene (15cm/1000yrs). It appears that the sedimentation rate may be affected by river discharge, with an increase in red-brown sediment during the interglacial periods. This is shown with an increase in sedimentation rate during MIS 5 and MIS 11. The age at the deepest part of the core (1360cm) is ~549,058yrs BP.",

    "description": "The second capture of the area surrounding the Floreat Surf Life Saving Club, these sand dunes were captured by UAV imagery on 24th Aug 2022 for the Cambridge Coastcare beach dune modelling and monitoring project. It was created as part of an initiative to innovatively monitor coastal dune erosion and visualize these changes over time for future management and mitigation. This data includes Orthomosaic, DSM, DTM, Elevation Contours, 3D Mesh, 3D Point Cloud and LiDAR constructed from over 500 images captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh\nThis LiDAR dataset is a 3D point cloud (i.e. a 3D set of points in .LAS format): the X,Y,Z position and colour information is stored for each point of the point cloud of the Floreat SLSC and South Floreat carpark (2022 Flight-1 project area).",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "The 2014 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, health and wellbeing, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 12 May to 15 June 2014. Overall, 99,392 employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 68%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download. \r\n\r\n* 2014 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2014 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2014 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2014 employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n \r\n* 2014 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2014 employee census for use with the SPSS software package.\r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2014 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2014 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is  the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012,  charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. \r\n\r\nGenerally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. \r\n\r\nThis dataset provides a record of the 2013 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2013 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2012 – 30 June 2013, for others it will be the 2013 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nFor the 2013 financial year (being the first period for reporting to the ACNC), the Commissioner exercised her discretion to extend the due date for lodgement to 31 March 2014. As at August 2014, approximately 42 000 registered charities have filed their 2013 AIS with the ACNC. The dataset is updated fortnightly.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the [ACNC Register](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity). There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information:\r\n\r\n-\tis commercially sensitive and it could cause harm\r\n-\tis false, confusing or misleading\r\n-\tis offensive\r\n-\tcould endanger public safety\r\n-\tfalls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund).\r\n\r\nSome charities have asked for their details to be withheld. If their withholding request is pending or has been approved, the AIS data relating to these charities has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity).\r\n\r\nThe 2013 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2013 reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS will ask further questions, particularly in relation to financial information for medium and large charities. The dataset of 2014 Annual Information Statements will be uploaded to data.gov.au in due course.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datatsets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://www.data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Average annual family income is\r\ncalculated as the family share of farm income plus any wages (that are\r\nincluded as farm costs for taxation assessment) paid to the owner manager,\r\nspouse and dependant children, plus all off-farm income of owner manager and\r\nspouse. The data is reported at the Statistical Division (SD) level for\r\nAustralia. This data relates to broadacre and dairy farms run by owner\r\nmanagers and has been collected by annual farm survey interview and is\r\nsupplemented by information in the farm accounts. The data is presented at a\r\nscale of 25000000. The following attributes are contained within the dataset;\r\nSd code a a unique 3 digit code for Statistical Divisions (SD), Sd name a the\r\nname of the Statistical Division (SD), Faminc a the average annual farm family\r\nincome for the period 1996-1997 to 1998-1999.

The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55.

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

We apply recently-developed statistical methods to a novel dataset, compiled from Australia's national account statistics and farm surveys. \r\n\r\n The results show agricultural productivity grew at 2.0 per cent a year between 1948-49 and 2013-14. This work provides a unique measure of the productivity performance of Australia's agriculture industry over time, and thereby provides insight into trends in farm performance and the effects of policy reforms.",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2018 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "title": "Over-arching record: Water Circulation of Jervis Bay (Jervis Bay Baseline Studies Project 8)",
    "description": "The Jervis Bay Project was set up to undertake baseline studies of the key habitats and species in Jervis Bay on the New South Wales coast, and to develop a monitoring program to assist with long-term management of the bay. It was funded by the Department of Defence who at that time planned to relocate the fleet base of the Royal Australian Navy to Jervis Bay, and although this plan was abandoned mid-way through the study, the study was completed and the final report published in 1994.\n\nA series of 12 projects were proposed, with the 8th, 'Water Circulation of Jervis Bay' being undertaken by the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of this project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nTwo experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay. The first during the summer months when the bay is normally thermally stratified, from 6th December 1988 to 11th January 1989, and the second during winter when thermal stratification is generally much weaker, from 10th July to 30th October 1990. Between these two experiments, moorings were maintained in the bay entrance and on the shelf, from April 1989 to April 1990, in order to investigate exchange processes between the bay and shelf waters. Further, to better understand the partition of energy from the wind through the water column, two deployments were made with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler that gives current time series at 1m depth intervals over most of the water column. A summer deployment of the Doppler profiler was run from December 1990 to January 1991 and a winter deployment was run from July to September 1991. Approximately once per month throughout the three year period, 1989-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within the bay and out across the shelf to provide additional information on the water exchange and circulation.\n\nAvailable to download through this record is a pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project.

    "description": "Taken from the survey report:\n\nConstruction of a suitable runway near Casey is a major objective of the Air Link from Hobart to the Australian Antarctic Territory and the main focus of this season's fieldwork. The 2002/2003 summer season's Air Transport Project identified and started construction of a snow capped 'Blue Ice' runway site known as A6 South, located in the Upper Vanderford Glacier (UVG) region approximately 65 km south east of Casey Station.\n\nThis season a five-member team was assembled to undertake additional investigation work in relation to snow pavement and to finalise the appropriate aeronautical charts needed to operate a runway supporting wheeled aircraft conducting inter-continental flights from Hobart.\n\nThe runway survey work this season had several objectives:\n\n1) undertake further work on A6 South to produce Type A and B aeronautical charts;\n\n2) determine the Runway flow (movement) rates;\n\n3) survey the Taxiway and Apron areas to facilitate their design; and\n\n4) survey the traverse route from Casey to the site to assist in VHF communications between the Runway and Casey station.\n\nAdditional to the Runway survey a number of other tasks were also carried out in\n\nsupport of science programs being undertaken at Casey.\n\nThe tasks outlined in the surveyors brief are varied and numerous and are included to provide the surveyor with a full and appropriate work program. The various tasks are prioritised, usually with one or two major tasks and a number of minor tasks listed to be undertaken if the opportunity arises. This season's Survey Brief has been included in Appendix A with a summary of achievements listed in Appendix B.\n\nThe following report covers the survey fieldwork undertaken by Air Transport Project (ATP) during the 2003/2004 Summer Field Season. Data collected in support of other scientific programs has been included in this report primarily as a record of work undertaken by the mapping program. These data have been supplied to the various scientists for inclusion in their studies.\n\nSpot height and contour data that were a product of this survey are included in shapefiles available from the Related URLs. The spot heights and contours that were a product of this survey have Dataset_id = 278 in the attribute table.\n\nThe spot heights are along the route from Casey to Wilkins aerodrome, in the vicinity of the aerodrome, along the route to Browning Peninsula and from Browning Peninsula to the aerodrome.\n\nThe contours cover Wilkins aerodrome and nearby area.\n\nElevations are in metres above mean sea level.\n\nThe surveyor, Aaron Read, calculated the elevations above mean sea level from elevations above the ellipsoid using the EGM96 geoid model.",

    "description": "This interactive dashboard contains a map and graphs to indicate the loss of mature trees in the urban area of the ACT, from 2015 to 2020.  The map uses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data\ncaptured in 2015 and 2020 to plot the trajectory of mature tree loss over time. The associated graphs\nand diagrams indicate mature tree loss by suburb, land use and suburb age. These metrics can be used to assess the loss of mature trees across the landscape as required under the Loss of Mature Native Trees Action Plan 2021.\n\nCaveats for the LiDAR-derived data used in this dashboard:\n1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees.\n2. The variable window filter algorithm used in this project was optimised to delineate larger, native trees. As such, smaller (younger) trees and exotics such as Pinus radiata may be under-segmented.\n3. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights), there may still be errors present.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset contains all the input files and scripts to run the regional scale analytic element model for the Gloucester subregion as described in product 2.6.2, Groundwater numerical modelling for the Gloucester subregion (Peeters et al. 2016), as well as a single instance of the model output files.\n\n\n\nThis model is run 10.000 times to provide inputs for the uncertainty analysis and the alluvial modflow models for the Avon and Karuah, also described in product 2.6.2 (Peeters et al. 2016).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPeeters L, Dawes W, Rachakonda P, Pagendam D, Singh R, Pickett T, Frery E, Marvanek S, and McVicar T (2016) Groundwater numerical modelling for the Gloucester subregion. Product 2.6.2 for the Gloucester subregion from the Northern Sydney Basin Bioregional Assessment. Department of the Environment, Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and Geoscience Australia, Australia. http://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/product/NSB/GLO/2.6.2.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe dataset has all files and scripts necessary to execute the 10.000 runs on the linux platform of the CSIRO High Performance Cluster computers. Powerpoint file 'GLO_AEM_flowchart.pptx' describes the workflow of how all the files link together and the order in which they need to be executed.\n\n\n\nThe folder 'inputs' has all the input files for the model. Part of these inputs are stochastic components of the model, which are generated through python script 'inputs/GLO_AEM_stochastic_generator.py'. This script produces the 1000 stochastic realisations of number and position of coal seams (inputs/coalseams), the major faults (inputs/majorfaults), the subseismic faults (inputs/subseismicfaults) and a single realisation of the CSG well file (GLO_AEM_wellfile.csv), which has the coordinates, coal seams intercepted and pumping schedule of the 110 CSG wells in the model. The script takes three input files: 'inputs/GLO_AEM_wellfile_xy.csv', 'inputs/GLO_AEM_MajorFaults.csv','inputs/GLO_AEM_subseismicfaultdomain.csv'. \n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_MajorFaults.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_subseismicfaultdomain.csv' control the geometry and position of the faults and is derived from the geological model described in product 2.1 (Frery et al 2016), dataset GLO RMS Model Depth Structure Eroded v01. File 'inputs/GLO_AEM_wellfile_xy.csv' has the coordinates of the 110 CSG wells, randomly distributed within the AGL stage 1 area (dataset AGL Gloucester Gas Project AECOM report), taking into account the existing and planned mines (dataset Gloucester digitised coal mine boundaries) and the NSW exclusion zones (dataset New South Wales 2 kilometers Residential exclusion zones).\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_BasinBoundary.csv' are the lateral boundaries of the model and are derived from the geological map (dataset Geological Maps Combined for NSW).\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_gwreceptors.csv' are the locations of the groundwater receptors in the weathered zone (from dataset GLO Receptors 20150828).\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_footprint_baseline.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_footprint_crdp.csv' are the footprints of the mine pits, from dataset 'Gloucester digitised coal mine boundaries'\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_waterproduction_baseline.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_waterproduction_crdp.csv' are the time series of pumping rates assigned to the mine footprints. These are sourced from following reports: Duralie: HydroSimulations (2014) - Stratford: Heritage Computing (2012) - Rocky Hill: Australasian Groundwater and Environmental Consultants Pty Ltd (2013)\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_targets.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_interpol_targets.csv' are the coordinates of the output locations in the weathered zone for, respectively, communication with the alluvial groundwater models and interpolation of exceedance probability grids. These coordinates are chosen and generated by the modelling team.\n\n\n\nThe above mentioned files are the input files for the main python script, 'GLO_AEM.py', which uses the ttim package (in directory 'ttim', Bakker, 2015) to generate following files:\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_CSG_waterproduction_0000.csv': simulated water production rate CSG wells for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwreceptors_baseline_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at groundwater receptors under baseline for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwreceptors_crdp_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at groundwater receptors under CRDP for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwtargets_baseline_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at target locations for communication with alluvial modflow models under baseline for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwtargets_crdp_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at target locations for communication with alluvial modflow models under CRDP for simulation 0000\n\n\n\nThe python script reads parameter combination from 'GLO_DoE_Parameters.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01', the 10.000 parameter combinations for the design of experiment to train the emulators.\n\n\n\nBatch file 'GLO_AEM.q' manages running all 10.000 parameter combinations on the linux platform of the CSIRO High Performance Cluster computers.\n\n\n\nPython script 'GLO_AEM_final_spatial_interpolation.py' is almost identical to 'GLO_AEM.py', but reads 200 randomly sampled parameter combinations of the posterior parameter combinations in file 'GLO_AEM_Posterior_interpol.csv' from dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. It produces following output files:\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_interpol_baseline_0000.csv': simulated drawdown at interpolation locations for exceedance probability grids under baseline for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_interpol_crdp_0000.csv': simulated drawdown at interpolation locations for exceedance probability grids under CRDP for simulation 0000\n\n\n\nBatch file 'GLO_AEM_final_spatial_interpolation.q' manages running all 10.000 parameter combinations on the linux platform of the CSIRO High Performance Cluster computers.\n\n\n\nThis dataset only contains a single set of model outputs. During the modelling for the Bioregional Assessments, 10.000 of the output files were generated. \n\nThe drawdown time series at the receptors are postprocessed with script 'GLO_AEM_postprocessing.py' (using batch file 'GLO_AEM_postprocessing.q') to generate maximum drawdown (dmax) and time to maximum drawdown (tmax) in file 'GLO_AEM_10kruns.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. \n\nPython script 'GLO_AEM_postprocessing_Qcsg.py' is used to generate the maximum CSG water production rate in file 'GLO_Qcsg_DoE.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. \n\nPython script 'GLO_AEM_interpol_postprocessing.py' is used to generate exceedance probabilities of dmax and tmax in file 'GLO_AEM_interpol_excprob.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. \n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFrery E, Rohead-O'Brien H, Wilkes P, McVicar T, Van Niel T, Li L, Barron O, Rachakonda P, Zhang Y, Dawes W, Marvanek S, Buettikofer H, and Gresham M (2016) Observations analysis and statistical analysis and interpolation for the Gloucester subregion.

This dataset brings together information collected through a series of aerial strip transects surveys during 1985, as well as anecdotal observations of dugong distribution collected from regular patrols conducted by Australian Customs. Data collection techniques were not rigorous enough to calculate abundance estimates, however the strip transect surveys do provide the first snapshot of dugong distribution through the West Kimberley. This dataset also forms a useful template for the conduct of more rigorous surveys.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This issue of the Australian forest and wood products statistics (AFWPS) includes updated 2015-16 data for key domestic indicators of forestry sector activity, including sales and service income and industry valued added. It also includes interim estimates of the volume and value of logs harvested in 2016-17, along with updated 2016-17 trade statistics for wood products and data for housing and other residential commencements. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Forestry industry value added, or contribution to GDP, increased for the third year in a row, growing by 9 per cent to $8.6 billion in 2015-16. Sales and service income for the forestry sector also grew strongly to $23.7 billion in 2015-16 (up 7 per cent from the previous year). \r\n• ABARES estimates that Australia's forestry sector continued to grow strongly in 2016-17, with the total volume and value of logs harvested reaching record levels. Estimated total volume log harvest from native forests and commercial plantations increased by 9 per cent to 32.8 million cubic metres and estimated total value increased by 12 per cent to $2.5 billion. \r\n• After four consecutive years of growth in residential construction activity in Australia, dwelling commencements fell by 6 per cent to 219,300 in 2016-17. The decrease in commencements of other residential buildings (including units and house conversions) was greater than the decrease in house commencements. \r\n• Australia's trade in wood products has been growing since 2012-13 and reached a record level of $8.6 billion in 2016-17. The value of exports reached a record level of $3.4 billion (up 9 per cent from the previous year), while the value of imports fell to $5.3 billion (down 4 per cent from a record level in the previous year). \r\n• China was our largest trading partner in 2016-17 for wood products, accounting for over a quarter of Australia's total wood product imports, nearly half of total wood product exports and the majority of total wood products export growth over the year. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for May 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for beef producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Beef producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that had at least 100 head of beef cattle on hand at 30 June 2015. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Average total cash receipts for Australian beef farms increased by around 14 per cent in 2014-15 to $391 000 and by a similar percentage in the following year to around $442 000. \r\n• The increases in total cash receipts largely reflected higher receipts from cattle sales, which were largely a result of higher cattle prices. \r\n• In real terms, estimated average farm cash incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 are among the highest recorded since 2000-01. \r\n• Northern region beef farms recorded higher average farm incomes than farms in the Southern region in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. \r\n• Reflecting higher incomes, the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for beef farms increased from -0.1 per cent in 2013-14 to 0.6 per cent in 2014-15 and is estimated to increase further in 2015-16 to around 1.9 per cent. \r\n• Average beef farm debt trended upwards, in real terms, between 2000-01 and 2014-15. In 2014-15 average total debt was around $460 000 a farm. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of a rapid increase in average farm size. \r\n• However, increases in debt over time has largely been supported by an accompanying increase in the total capital value of beef farms. Consequently, average farm business equity ratios remained relatively steady over the period 2000-01 to 2015-16. \r\n",

    "description": "ACT Canopy Estimate Statistics 2020 for blocks, divisions and road polygons are derived from the ACT Canopy Cover 2020 footprint dataset (available soon). The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area).

The point clouds were processed by the ACT Government with ArcGIS to produce ACT Canopy Cover footprint for vegetation above 3m. Canopy modelling was completed at 1m resolution. The canopy footprints were then augmented to block, division and road polygon coverage statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate system: GDA 2020 MGA Zone 55.\n\nTemporal coverage: April 2020\n\nUpdate schedule: every 5 years\n\n\n\nTile photo by Mark Jekabsons, Trees over Gungahlin\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveat: Comparison of the ACT 2020 Canopy Cover to the 2015 is not comparable due to differences in methodology, including differences in resolution and point density, and time of year the LiDAR was captured. The 2015 data was captured in late Autumn, whereas 2020 was captured in early Autumn.",

    "description": "Mating signals are often directed at numerous senses, and provide information about species identity, gender, receptiveness, individual identity and mate quality. Given the diversity of colourful body patterns in invertebrates, surprisingly few studies have examined the role of these visual signals in mate recognition. This experiment demonstrates that distinct carapace colour patterns in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis, enable males to discriminate between their female neighbours and unfamiliar females.\n\nThe experiment was conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT from September to January 2003 and 2004. \n\nThe methodology involved identifying male and female U.capricornis neighbours living 10-30cm apart. The female was caught and randomly assigned to one of seven treatments, including replacement with a similar sized female, and various manipulations to alter her appearance. The female was then tethered close to the males burrow and the interaction monitored. The males behaviour was classified as either 'approach' or 'ignore.' The results show that males tended to approach unfamiliar females tethered nearby, whereas they were more likely to ignore their unaltered neighbours tethered in the same position.",

Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "The record describes data collected from a winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored in the central part of Jervis Bay, New South Wales (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nTwo resources are provided in this record: 1) A schematic of depth bin location for the winter deployment and, 2) The raw, or unfiltered current values for each bin depth provided every 60 minutes in terms of east/west and north/south components.\n\nThis child record relates to the parent, c571bb80-2ae7-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Wine grape farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated wine grape farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on wine grape farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where most of the Basin's wine grapes are produced. Average farm cash incomes of wine grape farms rose from 2006-07 to 2011-12 before falling in 2012-13 in response to lower grape production. An increase in production contributed to slightly higher average farm cash incomes in 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n Grape crops in many areas of the Basin require regular irrigation because of the warm and relatively dry climate. From 2006-07 to 2014-15 the average volume of water used on wine grape farms mostly increased with this increase mainly due to an increase in average farm size. The proportion of grape farms using drip/trickle irrigation technologies has increased. \r\n\r\n The number of grape growers trading temporary water allocations varied from year to year. The years with the highest proportions of net buyers were 2007-08 and 2008-09. ",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for Plant Health Australia  \r\n Overview  \r\n Experience from overseas indicates that the cost of an incursion by black-striped mussel is likely to be large without management. This report presents a comparison of the estimated costs associated with the alternative responses to an incursion: eradication and containment. Hypothetical incursions of black-striped mussel in ten case study areas across four Australian ports were considered. The cost of eradicating the initial mussel incursion from a case study area is compared to the cost of containing the mussel population to the port encompassing the case study area. The findings indicate that eradication is in most cases the preferred and less costly option over a range of time scales with the caveat that the likelihood of successful eradication will depend on early detection and response. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n•  Mytilopsis sallei  (black-striped mussel) is an invasive marine species that has been translocated from its native range in the Caribbean to a large number of ports in southern and eastern Asia. \r\n• An incursion of black-striped mussel in Darwin in 1999 was successfully eradicated at a cost of in excess of $3.2 million in 2012 terms. This species has been reported to have become established in a number of overseas trading ports, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai. The risks of translocation to Australia have therefore increased in recent years. \r\n• If an incursion by this species is not managed, it has the potential to cause significant and widespread economic and environmental damage. \r\n• A comparison of the costs associated with eradication with those of containment and control in a range of scenarios found that in many cases eradication is the preferred option, but containment and control may be preferred in some situations. \r\n",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Program from sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. A landscape classification approach was used to determine how hydrological changes due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development may affect ecosystems at a landscape scale in the Isa GBA region. Nine landscape classes have been identified for the Isa GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nInputs into the landscape classification were based on existing classification schemes wherever possible and can be purely physical, biological or predictive. Choice of approach depends on the availability of data at an appropriate scale, as well as the expertise and resources for undertaking the assessment. Landscape classifications should be credible, transparent, logical and consistently applied; where possible, match other classifications (or at least some of their classes); and be feasible within available resourcing. The landscape classification developed for the Isa GBA region is based on Queensland Land Zones (Wilson and Taylor, 2012), which were supplied by the Queensland Government (State of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science), 2018) and assigned to corresponding landscape classes.\r\n\r\nState of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science) (2018) Biodiversity status pre-clear reg ecosys QLD 2018/03/01.

    "title": "Victorian Alpine Resorts - Daily Snow Depth Records Mount Baw Baw",
    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "A tide gauge mooring was installed in 10-12m of water 200m off the west coast of Bowen Island, Jervis Bay. Opposed to other moorings in the area, this particular mooring did not house additional current meters. \n\nOver a period of approx. 9 months the mooring was deployed 4 times in the same location (as illustrated). \nDeployments 1-4  -35.1183 S 150.763 E. \nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 22/6/89 - 13/7/89... 2) 28/8/89 - 13/11/89... 3) 13/11/89 - 29/1/90... 4) 29/1/90 - 28/3/90.\n\nDatasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the tide gauge over the study period.\nThe Aanderaa WLR5 tide gauges used in this study average over 41 seconds for all sampling intervals. In the case of the 2nd and 3rd deployment the sampling interval was 15mins, while for the 4th deployment a sampling interval of 30mins was used. Unfortunately no data is available from the 1st deployment. \n\nThe tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~10m in all deployments. In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2014 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2014 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2013 – 30 June 2014, for others it will be the 2014 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nAs at November 2016, approximately 46 000 registered charities have submitted their 2014 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2014 reporting period. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS asked information about charity finances for the first time. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greated detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe first of these six experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay during the summer months, when the waters are normally thermally stratified. This experiment consisted of 8 current meters in 3 moorings within the bay, along with pressure gauges to measure water levels and a meteorological station measuring winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head. The moorings were maintained for a single deployment from 6th December 1988 to 11th January 1989. [Given that this meteorological data bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nThe black, yellow and orange moorings held tidal gauges, while the red, blue and green moorings held current meters at various depths. The red mooring held current meters at ~6.5m, 10.5m, 14.5m and 18.5m, while the blue mooring held meters at ~5.5m and 11.5m and the green mooring at ~5.5m and 9.5m.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.  There are four subsidiary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n30915440-c321-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\nc5340590-c3b5-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\na4d79ad0-c3c1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\n08d650b0-c3f1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8",

    "title": "Fish Remnant Patches",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe maps represent a compilation of dryland salinity risk and hazard mapping\r\nfor 2000, 2020 and 2050. The map shows the broad distribution of areas\r\nconsidered as having either a high salinity risk or a high salinity hazard. In\r\nsouthern Australia where groundwater level and trend data are available,\r\nassessments that are more confident have been possible. However, in northern\r\nAustralia groundwater data for trend analysis are very sparse or non-existent.\r\nIn these regions, salinity assessments have been based on the presence of\r\ngeological, landscape, regolith, land use and climate attributes which are the\r\nprime drivers of salinity. This national map provides a basis for identifying\r\nthose regions where more detailed assessments are warranted, and where land\r\nuse changes should be targeted if the risks are to be managed.The bulk of non-\r\nagricultural areas in Western Australia, South Australia and western New South\r\nWales were considered to have a very low salinity risk and were not\r\nassessed.Please note that the Commonwealth and all suppliers of source data\r\nused to derive the maps of aAustralia, Forecast Areas Containing Land of High\r\nHazard or Risk of Dryland Salinity from 2000 to 2050a3 do not warrant the\r\naccuracy or completedness of information in this product.

    "description": "#Updated September 2021 to include land use tiles. These tiles address issues with analysis of the large single dataset.#\r\n\r\nThis vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. \r\n\r\nThe vector geodatabase has been cut into 7 shapefile tiles. This reduces the file size and enables more analysis. The extent of tiles is shown below:  \r\n•\tSwan Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth West Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth Coast Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tNorthern Agricultural Region Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tPeel Harvey Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tAvon Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tRangelands Natural Resource Management region\r\n",

    "title": "GBR - Dating and mapping historical changes in Great Barrier Reef coral communities, 2007 - 2010 (MTSRF 1.1.4, UQ)",
    "description": "Trajectories of decline have been observed in coral reefs throughout the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific region attributable to the synergistic effects of human-induced disturbances. Whilst direct and indirect evidence suggests that inshore reefs from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are showing signs of regional decline following European settlement in the mid 18th century, it has proven difficult to ascertain the link between anthropogenic disturbance and coral degradation on a regional scale. This is primarily due to the absence of detailed ecological baselines on the past condition of many of these reefs prior to the advent of long-term monitoring in the mid 1980¿s.\n\nAn understanding of the timing, frequency, duration and cause of mortality events in hard coral communities is necessary to help direct management efforts towards ameliorating potential impacts. Furthermore, assessing the spatial and temporal variability of changes in community structure before and after European settlement, will provide an invaluable management tool to overcome the ¿shifting baseline¿ syndrome.\n\nBy dating and mapping historical changes in coral communities of inshore reefs of the GBR, the purpose of this study is to provide a detailed baseline assessment on coral community structure and an accurate chronology on the history and nature of mortality events.\n\nDead coral skeletons have been dated using the highly-precise (2? ± up to 1 year) thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) uranium-series (U-series) dating method in order to determine 1) the timing of historical mortality in coral communities and massive Porites corals in the Palm Islands region (central Inshore GBR) and reefs adjacent to catchments in the southern GBR (Mackay region) and far northern GBR, 2) historical patterns of storm occurrence on the offshore GBR (One Tree and Heron Reefs), and 3) Holocene sea level changes from the inshore GBR (Magnetic Island).\n\nSo far, more than 320 samples have been dated at the Radiogenic Isotope Facility, University of Queensland. Our results have revealed shifts in coral community structure and a loss of previously dominant Acropora corals in the early 20th century in the Palm Islands region. It is theorized that this loss may be attributable to the synergistic impacts of declining water quality and climatic related factors. Analysis of uplifted reef blocks from the offshore GBR reveals a period of high storm activity throughout the 19th & 20th centuries. Furthermore, U-series dating of fossil massive corals from Magnetic Island suggests that sea level was higher than present around 2200 to 7000 years ago during the Holocene.\n\nOverall, our results show that U-series dating and palaeoecological approaches can provide unique insight into the GBR¿s past.\n\n\nData Units: U-series age (AD) ± 2-sigma error\n\n\nReferences:\n\n- Yu K.

This project will employ acoustic monitoring technology in a series of inshore and offshore environments including coastal bays, inshore reefs and offshore reefs to monitor the presence and movements of predator species (elasmobranchs and teleosts). Mobile predators will be fitted with acoustic transmitters to define their presence and distribution, extent of movement and amount of connectivity between study locations (i.e., movement from bay to inshore reef, movement among reef platforms, etc.).  Predator presence and movement will be integrated with habitat mapping and environmental monitoring data to identify factors that lead to changes in movement patterns and to define any preferred locations or conditions that can be targeted for conservation or management.  Examination of use of habitats will provide information about the amount of time spent in various GBRMP zones and amount of movement among zones to assess the amount of protection provided under current management arrangements.",

White box - Yellow box - Blakely's red gum grassy woodland and derived grassland is a Critically Endangered Ecological Community under the EPBC Act 1999. The criteria for the EPBC community is slightly different to the ACT listed of the community Yellow box-Blakely's red gum grassy woodland and derived grassland community. \nMapping represents 'potential' distribution of the threatened ecological community (tec) as listing status of this community must be verified with field inspection.\nMapping product supersedes mapping completed by Maguire and Mulvaney in 2012 (see <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf\">https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf</a>).\nCaveat: This layer is indicative of likely habitat for threatened grassy box woodlands in the ACT but may not reflect the full distribution. Lack of identification of this community at a site does not necessarily indicate that the community does not occur there.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nThis dataset provides a userguide and setup information relating to accessing the Gescience Australia, 1 second SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM), for visualisation and analysis using ESRI ArcMap and ArcCatalog.\n\n\n\nThe 1 second DSM, DEM, DEM-S and DEM-H are national elevation data products derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. The SRTM data is not suitable for routine application due to various artefacts and noise.\n\nThe data has been treated with several processes to produce more usable products:\n\n\\* A cleaned digital surface model (DSM)\n\n\\* regular grid representing ground surface topography as well as other features including vegetation and man-made structures\n\n\\* A bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM)\n\n\\* regular grid representing ground surface topography, and where possible, excluding other features such as vegetation and man-made structures.\n\n\\* A smoothed digital elevation model (DEM-S)\n\n\\* A smoothed DEM based on the bare-earth DEM that has been adaptively smoothed to reduce random noise typically associated with the SRTM data in low relief areas.\n\n\\* A hydrologically enforced digital elevation model (DEM-H)\n\n\\* A hydrologically enforced DEM is based on DEM-S that has had drainage lines imposed and been further smoothed using the ANUDEM interpolation software.\n\n\n\nThe last product, a hydrologically enforced DEM, is most similar to the DEMs commonly in use around Australia, such as the GEODATA 9 Second DEM and the 25 m resolution DEMs produced by State and Territory agencies from digitised topographic maps.\n\nFor any analysis where surface shape is important, one of the smoothed DEMs (DEM-S or DEM-H) should be used. DEM-S is preferred for shape and vertical accuracy and DEM-H for hydrological connectivity. The DSM is suitable if you want to see the vegetation as well as the land surface height. There are few cases where DEM is the best data source, unless access to a less processed product is necessary.\n\nThe 1 second DEM (in its various incarnations) has quite different characteristics to DEMs derived by interpolation from topographic data. Those DEMs are typically quite smooth and are based on fairly accurate but sparse source data, usually contours and spot heights supplemented by drainage lines. The SRTM data is derived from radar measurements that are dense (there is essentially a measurement at almost every grid cell) but noisy.\n\nVersion 1.0 of the DSM was released in early 2009 and version 1.0 of the DEM was released in late 2009. Version 1.0 of the DEM-S was released in July 2010 and version 1.0 of the hydrologically enforced DEM-H was released in October 2011. These products provide substantial improvements in the quality and consistency of the data relative to the original SRTM data, but are not free from artefacts. Improved products will be released over time.\n\nThe 3 second products were derived from the 1 second data and version 1.0 was released in August 2010. Future releases of these products will occur when the 1 second products have been improved. At this stage there is no 3 second DEM-H product, which requires re-interpolation with drainage enforcement at that resolution.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe following datasets were used to derive this version of the 1 second DEM products:\n\n\n\nSource data\n\n1. SRTM 1 second Version 2 data (Slater et al., 2006), supplied by Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO) as 813 1 x 1 degree tiles. Data were produced by NASA from radar data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in February 2000.\n\n2. GEODATA 9 second DEM Version 3 (Geoscience Australia, 2008) used to fill voids.\n\n3. SRTM Water Body Data (SWBD) shapefile accompanying the SRTM data (Slater et al., 2006). This defines the coastline and larger inland waterbodies for the DEM and DSM.\n\n4. Vegetation masks and water masks applied to the DEM to remove vegetation.\n\n\n\nFull metadata, methodologies and lineage descriptions can be found in the PDF userguide within this dataset.\n\n\n\nFurther information can be found at http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_72759\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2011) Geoscience Australia, 1 second SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2021 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2021 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2021 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "description": "This dataset displays the position and extents of fuel breaks that have been identified to be upgraded in the RFMP 2019-28. Strategic fuel breaks are usually located between assets and surrounding rural areas or bushland. Fuel breaks typically consist of an area of variable width next to an existing track or road where bushfire fuels are maintained at lower levels. The lower fuel levels within fuel breaks result in much reduced fire behaviour. In this way, they provide a defensible space in which fire fighters may work with increased safety to protect assets, usually associated with back-burning activities during fire suppression operations. They also provide an opportunity to ‘break-up’ fire runs and assist with prescribed burning operations.",

    "title": "Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 18 December 2015",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nAsset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion (SSB) on 18 December 2015 (v1.1) supersedes the previous version of the SSB Asset database V1.0 (Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 03 August 2015, GUID: e453be86-2ddc-488b-9490-2e7c9ee130b7). It contains the Asset database (SSB_asset_database_20151218.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (SSB_asset_database_20151218_GISOnly.gdb), a data dictionary (SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the Water Asset Information Tool (WAIT) process as outlined below. This version should be used for Materiality Test (M2) test.\n\n\n\nThe user needs to join the Table Assetlist  or Elementlist  to the spatial data.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Sydney regions are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Sydney Basin bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\t              Notes\n\n1\t               1.0\t               3/08/2015\tInitial database.\n\n2\t               1.1\t               18/12/2015\t\"(1) Added 93 assets/9897elements from 18 datasets required by SSB asset workshop.\n\n                                                                                      (2) Fixed 22 AIDs in spatial data, which can not directly join  to relevant table in asset database\"\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 18 December 2015.

Data are obtained from in-situ data loggers deployed on the reef. Data loggers instantaneously record sea temperatures every 30 minutes and are exchanged and downloaded approximately every 12 months. Temperature loggers on the reef-flat are generally placed just below Lowest Astronomical Tide level. Reef-slope (or where specified as Upper reef-slope) generally refers to depths 5 - 9 m while Deep reef-slope refers to depths of ~20 m.",

    "title": "Warragamba - Flood Study - Stage 1",
    "description": "This report describes the hydraulic modelling for the first stage of a flood study of the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley commissioned by the Water Board in 1987. The study is required in order to \"determine the effects that various arrangements of major or future works for Warragamba Dam have on flooding in the valley\" (Revised Brief for the Preparation of an E.I.S., Water Boards August 1987). Stage 1 required a simplified model to be developed, calibrated and used to provide a measure of the relative effects on flooding of options for such works.\nThe model used is described in Section 2. Section 3 describes the calibration phase, in which three historical floods were used to adjust model parameters in order to match historical and modelled flood heights. The various options for Warragamba Dam flood protection works have an impact on the outflow hydrographs from the dam. Outflow hydrographs were determined for each option for five \"design\" floods and run through the calibrated hydraulic model. Peak flood heights were then tabulated and compared at three key locations In the valley. Section 4 describes the options while Section 5 discusses the modelling methods used to run these cases. The results are presented as a series of tables and graphs.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the works details from with surface water licences from NSW in the Gloucester & Hunter region. The short guide to NSW Office of Water's licensing data has been provided to accompany the dataset (both the spatial locations and the associated licence details). \n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act).\n\n2.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n3.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n4.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n5.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading). This means a spatial select with not find these WALs and the volumes associated with them. The WAL is still related to a particular Water Source and can be re-associated with a different Licensed Work Approval at a later date.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset was extracted from the NSW Office of Water's licensing system. Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area supplied by the Bioregional Assessment project teams for each area. Corresponding work locations found with each polygon were exported from the licensing system.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2013) NSW Office of Water Surface Water Offtakes - Hunter v1 24102013.
