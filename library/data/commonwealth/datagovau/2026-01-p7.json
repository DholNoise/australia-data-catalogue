    "title": "MBRC Planning Scheme - Coastal Hazard Storm Tide Overlay",
    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016 </b>\n\nThe Coastal Hazard (Storm Tide Inundation) Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "Under Section 22 of the Education Act 1990, parents have a legal duty to ensure their school-aged children attend school. Where absenteeism is persistent and an attendance improvement plan has been unsuccessful, and the parents have not meaningfully engaged with the plan, the matter is referred for consideration of legal action.\nData Notes:\n\n\nEach school has a discipline policy which sets out clear expectations for regular student attendance and consequences of truancy.\n\n\nWhere an attendance improvement plan has been unsuccessful in resolving the matter, and the parents have not meaningfully engaged with the plan, the matter is referred for consideration of legal action. \n\n\nProceedings are typically withdrawn when attendance has improved sufficiently to justify withdrawal, or because it appeared likely that a defence could be established (e.g. illness or disobedience).\n\n\nMatters not commenced occurred for a range of reasons including not being able to serve court papers, living arrangements for child changing, Family and Community Services removing children, improvement in attendance, and the student moving out of the jurisdiction.\n\n\nThese figures were prepared from administrative systems that were developed to internally track the progress of cases rather than to report externally. There are no statistical quality assurance measures applied to these figures, and there may be anomalies or errors due to the significant number of users who access the system. The data is correct to the best of the department’s knowledge and understanding.\n\n\nRefer to the individual publications for further information and policy context.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nLegal Services Directorate. NSW Department of Education.\n",

The key elements\ninclude:\n• a summary of available data,\n• reasons for the choice of hydrologic and hydraulic models,\n• calibration of these models,\n• establishment of design flood behaviour,\n• flood damages assessment.\nThe Flood Study does not consider flooding from local drainage which may result from inadequate\nurban drainage provisions.",

    "description": "    \n\nSurface of predicted Available Soil Water Holding Capacity of layer 1 (A\nHorizon a Top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.\nData modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State\nand CSIRO and presented as 0.01 degree grid cells. Available water capacity\n(AWC) is a measure of the store of water available for plants to use. AWC is\npresented here as the estimated total for the horizon, measured in millimetres\n(mm). The amount of water that is held by the soil varies according to a\nnumber of soil properties including, soil texture, organic matter content,\nbulk density and soil structure development. Available water capacity has been\ncalculated as the difference in volumetric water content at 0.1 bar and 15 bar\n(matric potentials of -10 kPa and -1.5 mPa) for each layer. These represent\nrespectively the field capacity (maximum water content following free\ndrainage) and the permanent wilting point (lower limit of soil moisture\navailable to plants). The final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic\nof all of the data obtained from various state and federal agencies. The\nsurfaces have been constructed with the best available soil survey information\navailable at the time. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One\nbeing that an area weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for\nthat polygon or map-unit. Another assumption made is that the look-up tables\nprovided by McKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict\nthe soil attribute values for each soil type. The digital map data is provided\nin geographical coordinates based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)\ndatum. This raster data set has a grid resolution of 0.001 degrees\n(approximately equivalent to 1.1 km). The data set is a product of the\nNational Land and Water Resources Audit (NLWRA) as a base dataset.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_awcaar9cl\n__06111a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The study was commissioned by the Albury City Council to inform the design of the South Albury levee upgrade. \n\nThis report supersedes previous flood studies for the Murray River at Albury and provides a revised flood frequency analysis of design flows, including calibration and sensitivity testing of the hydraulic model. The modelling shows that the proposed levee upgrades lead to improved flood protection in South Albury for events up to and including the 1% AEP (Annual Exceedance Probability) event. The flood mapping produced is intended to replace existing Murray River flood mapping and is considered fit for purpose to inform the levee's design.",

    "title": "Combined Effects of near-future temperature increase and ocean acidification on coral reef foraminifera Marginopora vertebralis and Heterostegina depressa. (NERP TE 5.2, AIMS and MARUM)",
    "description": "This dataset measures 5 effects of temperature and pH stressors (individual and combined) on tropical Foraminifera. The effects measured are: respiration, survivorship, growth, chl-a content and photochemistry. The study was conducted in 2011 and the data is provided as 5 single sheet spreadsheets.\n\nWarming and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry alter marine coastal ecosystems at an accelerating pace. Here we investigate the individual effects as well as the interaction of two stressors, temperature and pH on two species of benthic coral reef Foraminifera. This study consisted of a 7 week aquarium experiment manipulating temperature and pH changes and measuring survivorship, growth, photosynthesis, respiration and chl-a content in these benthic coral reef Foraminifera.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSpecimens were collected from Orpheus Island in the central Great Barrier Reef in September 2011. H. depressa was collected at a depth of 8¿12 m from coral rubble at Cattle Bay (18°34¿08¿¿ S 146°28¿55¿¿ E) and M. vertebralis at a depth of 0¿1 m (below Lowest Astronomical Tide) from turf algae-covered rocks at Hazard Bay (18°38¿58¿¿ S 146°29¿11¿¿ E). Both species were acclimated to laboratory conditions in tanks with moderate flow-through conditions (same as used in experimental setup) under low-light conditions (10 µmol photons m-2 s-1) for a period of 3 weeks.\n12 flow-through aquaria (working volume 17.5 L) were installed in a constant temperature room, and the experiment was carried out over a period of 53 d.\n\nSpecimens were kept inside custom made flow-through housings in each aquarium to achieve higher flow conditions more closely mimicking their habitat than in previous experiments. Flow-through housings contained two levels made from two standard 6-well cell culturing plates with flow-through lids. Twenty-four specimens (four specimens per well) of H. depressa were put in the lower level and the same number of M. vertebralis in the top level.\n\nFor each temperature (28 and 31 ºC) and pCO2 level (~790 µatm, pHNIST 7.9 and ~490 µatm, pHNIST 8.1), three replicate tanks were used; replicate tanks were randomly allocated to treatments. Seawater was pumped from the ocean into the laboratory, filtered to 5 µm, and stored in four header tanks where it was modified to the desired experimental conditions. Manual temperature and pH measurements were performed once to twice per day. Water samples for total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) determinations were taken weekly and analysed by AIMS Laboratory Services.\n\nFlow rates into the individual wells were recorded before and after the experiment, ranging between 180 and 220 mL min-1. Velocity of the water flow varied from 4.2¿5.2 9 10-1 m s-1 at the inlet (Ø 0.3 cm) to 3.1¿3.8 9 10-3 m s-1 at the outlet (Ø 3.5 cm). The flow rates between inlet and outlet are in the same range as those measured in situ over dead coral rubble and sea grass.\n\nFlow-through housings were made containing two levels so that one species could be kept in the top level exposed to higher light levels than the species in the lower level. Light levels were chosen for each species separately because of their known distributions and different light saturation points determined by pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry. PAM fluorometry results for M. vertebralis indicated a maximum saturating irradiance (Ek) between 100 and 140 µmol photons m-2 s-1 and for H. depressa between 40 and 60 µmol photons m-2 s-1 (Ziegler and Uthicke 2011). The light levels used in the experiment were chosen to fall below the Ek values by Ziegler and Uthicke (2011) and P¿I curve Pmax values determined by Vogel and Uthicke (2012) and were selected to correspond to levels which have shown no changes in mortality rates or chlorophyll a concentrations in previous experimental manipulations of the studied species.\n\nFurther detail can be found in this publication:\nSchmidt, C., Kucera, M., & Uthicke, S.

The audit was primarily focused on asset performance data to inform future asset management activities. To supplement the asset performance information, the audit also captured potential defects for further investigation by a suitably qualified officer. The findings from this audit represent a snapshot in time and don’t reflect the current situation.\n\nThis dataset identifies potential defects requiring further investigation by a qualified officer. Community path defects are managed in an ongoing manner through the Transport Canberra and City Services Asset Management System.",

    "description": "This database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:100 000 scale) detailing places of potential National Estate aesthetic significance.\n\nAesthetic value is the response derived from the experience of the environment or particular natural and cultural attributes within it. This response can be to either visual or non-visual elements and can embrace emotional response, sense of place, sound, smell and any other factors having a strong impact on human thought, feelings and attitudes. (Australian Heritage Commission & Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 1994, p. 5) \n\nBefore the Comprehensive Regional Assessment (CRA), some 80 forest places having National Estate aesthetic significance had been identified in Tasmania. In most instances, however, this value had not been identified or corroborated through community consultation; rather, it had been determined through assessment by natural environment heritage experts. The information gathered during the CRA process, which enhances understanding of the significance of these places, will be amalgamated with existing information and may be used to refine the boundaries of places already on the Register of the National Estate. \n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criterion E1: Importance for a community for aesthetic characteristics held in high esteem or otherwise valued by the community.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "River basin catchment areas for Melbourne.  This layer has two intended purposes: To provide a readily available amalgamation of MWC_Catchments that make up the river basins within Melbourne Water’s area. Useful for larger scale plans and maps.Data for basin boundaries have been captured by relevant State and Territory authorities from 1:10 000 and 1:250 000 scale source material. The balance of the data are from Geoscience Australia's GEODATA Coast 100K which includes coastlines and State and Territory borders. Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Region boundaries are updated based on current research, data and technology. It references previous work of the Australian Water Resources Management Committee as shown in Australia's River Basins 1997. This work is a collaboration of scientists from the Bureau of Meteorology, Australian National University Fenner School of Environment and Society, CSIRO Water for Healthy Country Flagship and Geoscience Australia.In late 2008, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), in partnership with Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and the Australian National University (ANU) commenced the development of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric). Geofabric is being developed to underpin the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS) within a single, consistent, national geospatial framework for hydrological features. Geoscience Australia's role in the Geofabric is to provide the best available national topographic spatial data for surface water features based on the National Topographic Data and Map Specifications. The river basin boundaries have been aligned (by Melbourne Water) to Melbourne Water Corporation (MWC) drainage catchments, to produce a consistent drainage and waterways catchment dataset to State level, since 2005.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data. Melbourne Water Corporation shall not be liable in any way to any person or group for loss of any kind including damages, costs, interest, loss of profits or special loss or damage, arising from any use, error, inaccuracy, incompleteness or other defect in this data.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

These surveys will inform coastal modelling currently being undertaken as part of coastal design projects and may also be used to set-out coastal protection structures such as groyne extensions and seawalls encroaching below the low tide mark. \n\nThe survey requirements were to provide enough coverage within marked survey extents and high priority areas for each site to capture key bed features and the toe of any coastal structures up to -0.5m AHD. Additionally, the fringes of reefs within the marked areas were to be captured. To supplement this data, a number of survey profiles were specified for capture. The survey to be carried out to Class D requirements.\n\nThis site, Woody Point, refers to a 2.2km x 0.6km long section of coastline on the southern tip of the Redcliffe Peninsula and incorporates the Woody Point jetty. The survey area as identified through the specifications, including profiles, is contained within an area of 1.9km by 1.6km.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nGloucester Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input  and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.  The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of  equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. The surface water component of the zone was derived by selecting assessment units within 150m or sharing an alluvial floodplain with an impacted river reach.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing tweaks were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nA selection buffer of 300m was created from the potentially impacted reaches of the surface water modelling interpolated reaches polylines. This was unioned with polygons in the alluvium layer that intersected with the potentially impacted reaches to create the composite selection layer (included in component layer folder). The composite selection layer was manually edited to constrain the extent to that reasonably potentially influenced by changes in river. \n\n\n\nThe composite selection layer was used to select, by intersection, AUs that represented the surface water\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) GLO ZoPHC and component layers 20170217.

    "description": "We request 15 hours of observing time with the Parkes UWL receiver (700-4000 MHz) to investigate frequency-dependent eclipsing in three spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs): one redback and two black widows. Spider MSPs commonly exhibit frequency-dependent eclipsing, which provides insights into their dense, magnetized plasma environments. We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "Live release 1.0\r\n\r\nThis APS Career Pathfinder dataset contains the capability frameworks, role definitions and learning catalogues used by the [APS Career Pathfinder](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/aps-career-pathfinder-tool) tool to facilitate career exploration and development in the Australian Public Service (APS).\r\n\r\nThe role definitions include typical APS roles, which describe the skills and general capability requirements typically found in APS jobs based on those roles. You can use these definitions to determine potential career pathways and identify skills gaps and learning solutions that may help fill those gaps.\r\n\r\nThe focus at present is on digital roles, and therefore the capability frameworks, role definitions and the learning catalogue we are using primarily address digital, data and ICT. However, the APS Career Pathfinder tool has the capability to work with other types of capability framework, with roles and leaning mapped accordingly, so that it can support career exploration and development in potentially any area of capability.\r\n\r\nWe’ve defined roles according to skills drawn from capability frameworks, primarily [SFIA](https://sfia-online.org/en/), the Skills Framework for the Information Age. We use additional capability frameworks where relevant, including other skills frameworks (like [CIISec](https://www.ciisec.org/), the Chartered Institute of Information Security skills framework, and the [DCF](https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-data-capability-framework) Data Capability Framework), knowledge frameworks (like our simple knowledge magnitude scale), and behaviours (using the APS Work Level Standards). Additional details about roles include:\r\n\r\n* a brief description of each role or discipline\r\n* a mapping to the APS Job Family Model\r\n* a mapping to areas of interest\r\n* alternative names the roles may have\r\n* link to a ‘day in the life of’ profile for certain roles\r\n* relative role demand\r\n* link to learning solutions related to each role\r\n\r\nWe may define roles as typical APS roles, which are not specific to any agency, or as agency-specific roles. Agencies can include their role definitions in this dataset by sending their definitions to the contact email below.\r\n\r\nPlease send requests to change or augment any of this data to the contact email below. We may consult with our community before including them.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes the full SFIA framework, reproduced and made available through the [SFIA-AU](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/skills-framework-information-age) license. Use throughout Australia is permitted through this license, but may be restricted for foreign and multi-national organisations.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.

    "description": "BMAP Assets are assets at risk of bushfire, as identified in South Australia's nine Bushfire Management Area Plans (BMAPs). Each BMAP asset is assigned a risk rating of either low, medium, high, very high, or extreme. Assets may be assigned risk reduction treatments to reduce their level of risk. Where risk reduction treatments are assigned, the agency or agencies responsible for the treatment are also specified. BMAP Assets are captured in three datasets: BMAP Asset Points, BMAP Asset Lines, and BMAP Asset Polygons. This allows assets to be represented as either points (for example, a communication tower) lines (for example, a pipeline) or polygons (for example, an area of houses located at an urban/rural fringe). Assets are broadly categorised according to their value as either a \"Human Settlement\", \"Economic Value\", or \"Social Value\" asset. This is referred to as the \"Asset Type\". There is one other Asset Type, \"Environmental\", however due to the very large number of environmental assets, those assets are stored in a separate dataset named BMAP Environmental Assets. BMAPs are defined in Section 73A of the Fire and Emergency Services Act 2005. BMAPs can be viewed on the Bushfire Management Area Plans page on the State Bushfire Coordination Committee (SBCC) website. Further information is available on the SBCC website. In particular, the publication named \"The Bushfire Management Area Plan Handbook 2018\" provides more information about BMAP Asset data.",

    "description": "Boating activity on Victoria's waterways is governed by rules that are determined by Transport Safety Victoria in accordance with the powers of the Marine Safety Act 2010 (Vic). Those rules are published as the Vessel Operating and Zoning Rules (VOZR). The VOZR determines safe speed  and distance rules for Victoria's waterways and determines zones that are set aside for special purposes. These zones can include areas determined for exclusive use such as rowing only zones or zones that prohibit boating such as a swimming only zone. The VOZR is a documentary description of the rules and zones. This data is a geographical representation of those zones and includes polygons depicting the size and shapes of zones. Also contained within the dataset is point data that provides information regarding assets that are used to delineate zones and provide information to boaters to help identify the presence of those zones (such as a buoy on the water to show the corner of a zone). \nThe data has been collected by TSV as part of its audit program for monitoring compliance of the activities of local waterway managers. The data is not a complete GIS data set for Victoria's scheduled waterways and has been collected since 2008. The data is being periodically updated as audit activity collects new data. The data has not been collected with the express purpose of publication of this data. Any potential users may be required to apply an intrepretive process in order for the data to be re-purposed. TSV is currently undertaking a project to convert this data into a published waterways online system. As that project progresses, the information supplied with this data will improve. ",

    "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Synthesizing three decades of seagrass spatial data from Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait have globally significant seagrass habitat that provide food for threatened dugong and turtle, and habitat for commercially important fish and prawns. Key to understanding, managing, mitigating risk, and monitoring seagrass in this remote region is reliable data on seagrass distribution and species composition and how these changes through time. Data on seagrass has been collected in these areas since the 1980s, but data location and storage from these efforts remains disparate, in many cases not publicly available, and in some cases has already been lost. Our study will compile, validate and synthesize historical seagrass spatial data to create a publicly available database accessible on eAtlas. This product will provide end-users with a valuable spatial resource to assist management and monitoring of seagrass in the region. \n\n(i) Identify key seagrass habitat and migration corridors for dugong and turtles in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\n(ii) Identify regions where seagrass information is deficient (knowledge gaps)\n(iii) create a foundations for models assessing exposure to risk (water quality and other environmental impacts, climate change, etc)\n(iv) provide essential information for management, planning, and developing long-term monitoring plans\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • seagrass data [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC11) was collected from a depth of 502 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~30cm depth. From matching the 18O G. ruber curve with Martinson et al. (1987), 4 glacial cycles can be determined, incorporating Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 1 through to MIS 11. Isotopically heavier 18O values at ~460cm, ~345cm, 150cm, and 30cm correspond respectively to MIS 10, MIS 8, MIS 6 and the LGM. The d13C shows a trough lagging behind the 18O high during the glacial, although there are considerable fluctuations between MIS 8 and 6.",

    "description": "We request 15 hours of observing time with the Parkes UWL receiver (700-4000 MHz) to investigate frequency-dependent eclipsing in three spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs): one redback and two black widows. Spider MSPs commonly exhibit frequency-dependent eclipsing, which provides insights into their dense, magnetized plasma environments. We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "The Study Area\n\nThe study area comprises four sub-catchments within the Canterbury-Bankstown Council Local Government Area (LGA) that drain to Prospect Creek:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Georges Hall Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering approximately 145 hectares, this area predominantly features residential land with notable reserves, such as Crest Reserve and Garrison Point Reserve.</li>\n<li><strong>Lansdowne Sub-Catchment</strong>: Spanning 243 hectares, it includes residential areas alongside significant bushland and parklands, such as Lansdowne Park and Mirambeena Regional Park.</li>\n<li><strong>Miller Road Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering 50 hectares, this area includes residential zones with no defined water channels, relying on overland flow paths and a piped drainage network.</li>\n<li><strong>Villawood Sub-Catchment</strong>: The largest at approximately 740 hectares, this area comprises residential and industrial zones with a network of concrete-lined open channels.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA map of the study area is shown in Figure 1-2.\n\nConsultation\n\nCommunity and stakeholder consultation has been integral to this project. Key consultation activities included:\n<ul>\n<li>Engagement with the Floodplain Management Committee throughout the project phases;</li>\n<li>Community feedback collected through online surveys, email submissions, and in-person sessions, with a total of 67 recorded responses during initial consultation;</li>\n<li>Public exhibition of the draft study and plan, incorporating input from 57 engagements; and</li>\n<li>Targeted discussions on identified issues, such as voluntary house raising and stormwater management concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n\nModelling of Flood Behaviour\n\nCanterbury-Bankstown Council has implemented a consistent and advanced approach for modelling stormwater catchment flooding. The methodology integrates a dynamically linked 2D/1D hydrodynamic model (TUFLOW), which simulates flood behaviours with precision.\n\nThe TUFLOW model uses a two-dimensional grid to represent surface terrain while incorporating one-dimensional elements for stormwater pipes and channels. Overflow from drainage elements is accounted for, allowing flows to spill onto the grid and replicate overland and sheet flows across floodplains.\n\nFlood Risk Mapping &amp; Development Controls\n\nFlood risk mapping for the Prospect Creek sub-catchments categorises the area into three flood risk precincts, guiding development controls:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Areas prone to significant flood damages and evacuation challenges, where development is generally restricted.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Zones with moderate risk, where damages can be mitigated with suitable controls.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Regions with minimal risk where most developments are permitted, subject to planning regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAdditionally, overland flow precincts have been identified to account for shallow inundation areas, enabling tailored development controls.\n\nThe Flood Problem\n\nA comprehensive flood damages database was developed to evaluate flood impacts and inform flood mitigation strategies. Key findings include:\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 2,667 properties are impacted in the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event, with over 60% located in the Villawood sub-catchment.</li>\n<li>Average Annual Damages (AAD) across the sub-catchments exceed $93.7 million, with the Villawood sub-catchment contributing a significant portion due to its low-lying industrial areas.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFlood mitigation measures were assessed, and recommendations for effective floodplain management have been outlined to address these challenges.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Cape Wiles.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe CSP HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 237 deg true east of north (approximately north by north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

The area was divided into two sections: a northern one held for the most part by the Queanbeyan Council, and a southern section at present held privately as a grazing lease. \"Indicated\" reserves, based on the present quarrying level, of 170,000 cub. yds were established in the northern section. Most of this material will be of the same quality as that being quarried at present; some of the material towards the southern boundary of the lease will however be harder and require more blasting. In the grazing leases \"inferred reserves\" of 140,000 cub. yds. were delineated. It is expected that this material will be quite suitable for road making but may be slightly inferior in sizing to the material at present being quarried; also it may require more blasting in some portions than the material being quarried at present; it will carry a higher average overburden than the Queanbeyan lease.",

Utilities data supplied included fuel related infrastructure. GHD compiled the utilities data from original CAD drawings collected over many years through management of island infrastructure by the Commonwealth Department of Administrative Services. The CAD drawings were converted into ESRI shapefiles by GHD.\nIn 2006 GHD updated several of the 2001 utilities shapefiles.\nUtilities for the airport, which previously only contained data in the water supply layer, were received from the Indian Ocean Territories Administration (Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities) in January 2013. The new data was provided as dng cad file and included fuel lines, which was added to the relevant layers.\nData indicative only and not to be relied on.

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the Corangamite CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the measurement of Secchi Depth and Total suspended solids (inorganic and organic components) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling.\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "The Fishermans Bend groundwater studies were conducted between 2015 and 2017, across the five precincts of Fishermans Bend, as part of the proposed redevelopment. The studies focused on confirming the depth of groundwater and the regional groundwater quality. The studies aimed to understand the regional groundwater quality, and therefore did not focus on specific sources of contamination. Some contamination was identified that will need further assessment through the audit system or as part of EPA’s regulatory role as development proceeds.\nThe data provided here is contained within the technical reports at www.epa.vic.gov.au/fishermansbend. The data set includes:\n- field physical measurements (standing water level (m from Top of Casing, mAHD), time, date)\n- field chemical measurements (pH, electrolytic conductivity (µS/cm), reduction-oxidation potential (mV), temperature (°C), dissolved oxygen (mg/L))\n- groundwater laboratory analytical results (raw results only. QA/QC data, such as blanks, trips, spikes, surrogates and duplicates can be viewed in the technical reports)\n- soil laboratory analytical results from the installation of monitoring wells in 2015 and 2016 (raw results only)\n- spatial coordinates (eastings, northings, GDA94)\n- registered bore licence numbers (i.e. bore_id) where available.\nThis data is also available through DELWP's Water Management Information System (WMIS).\nEPA Victoria will continue to be the custodians of the data; including provisioning access to these wells for sampling by interested parties, and the collation of field and laboratory results from sampling by interested parties.",

    "description": "Based on Landgate’s high resolution aerial imagery, CSIRO generate the Urban Monitor mosaic from which vegetation height strata of endemic and exotic species has been calculated and reported as an area for each height strata of 0 – 3 m, 3 – 8 m, 8 – 15 m and 15+ m. The area of grass covered areas falling into the 0 – 50 cm range has also been calculated and recorded in square metres. Vegetation coverage greater than 3 metres in height has been deemed tree canopy. The canopies have been aggregated and reported as total canopy coverage in square metres. Urban Forest Mesh Blocks have been published for the following years: 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018.\n\nParcels to be analysed were sourced from the 2016 Integrated Land Information Database (ILID) and supplied to CSIRO by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. The results were assembled into Urban Forest features where the Urban Monitor coverage was complete.\n\nLand parcels were assigned locational data (2016 ABS meshblocks, suburbs, local government authority (LGA) and planning sub-region) based on the parcel centroid. They were then attributed with the following land use categories: • Street Block: residential, commercial, industrial, hospital/medical, educational, and some agricultural and transport land uses • Parks: public parks, open space, private recreation grounds and State Forest • Roads: roads including road reserves • Other Infrastructure: rail, airports and utilities infrastructure • Other: land uses in transition that have not progressed sufficiently to be Street Blocks or do not conform to urban form • Rural: primary production land that does not fall in categories above • Water: ocean and other waterways, including reservoirs\n\nThe vegetation height strata areas and total canopy coverage values were calculated for each land parcel. The statistics were then aggregated by the field MB_MonitorCategory, a concatenation of the fields MB_CODE16 and MonitorCategory. Canopy coverage percentages and ranges were calculated based on the sum of the area of parcels within each MB_MonitoryCategory. As parcels with sufficient Urban Monitor coverage for Urban Forest analysis may vary between years making comparison difficult, a field called MBPercentage was added which shows the percentage of the total MB_MonitorCategory area (MBArea) covered by parcels with Urban Forest values for that year. Corresponding MBPercentage values for all published years were also added to inform users.\n\nNOTE: As mesh block attributes were assigned based on parcel centroid, aggregated mesh block boundaries based on the parcels may not match ABS mesh block boundaries, and MBAreas will not match ABS mesh block areas.

It comprises a digital map showing the locations of Windmill Islands lichenometric observations and a linked digital database containing the maximum thallus size recorded at each location. It includes observations of lichens growing on nunataks for which the time of deglaciation is known and observations of lichens growing on supraglacial moraine ridges for which the time of formation is not known. This dataset thus provides the basis for a relative chronology of moraine development based on the assumption that the growth of the lichen thallus has been constant since the time of deglaciation.\n\n      \n\nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

The mapping complements mapping of forests undertaken in the Regional Forest Agreement (RFA).  The focus of the mapping is non forest vegetation.  The mapping will allow strategic direction of Bushcare funding on the island through on-ground identification of priority vegetation communities.  Non-forest vegetation mapped includes Eucalypt woodland, heath complexes, non-Eucalypt small trees, non-Eucalypt trees, heath, saltmarsh, scrub, grassland, wetland riparian vegetation and agricultural land.   Aerial photograph interpretation is primarily used for vegetaiton mapping and field checking of vegetation communities was extensive.  Vegetation condition, where measured during field-verification is also recorded, and disturbances including grazing, burning, exotics, fragmentation are noted both from aerial photograph interpretation and field verification.   The mapping is produced using Genamap, a powerful data-driven geographic information system with a custom made interface, specifically tailored to facilitate specialised mapping.  The interface provides a simple method for complex data-entry ino an Oracle database.",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2010_V09.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, NSW, Oct 14, 2010\nArrived:  \tSydney, NSW, Oct 31, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This record describes the Wildlife on Voyage (WoV) data collected on Investigator voyage IN2023_V02, titled: \"Gigantic submarine landslide offshore western Tasmania: risk mitigation for shelf-derived tsunami in Australia.\" The voyage took place between March 24, 2023 and April 30, 2023 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart.\nThese surveys were conducted alongside Marine Mammal Observer (MMO) duties associated with seismic operations. There were two survey protocols: Continuous (which were performed when seismic operations required MMOs on watch for the entire survey period); and structured snapshots.\nThe collected data were processed (quality-controlled), and subsequently archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).\nPlease note: besides marine mammals and seabirds, the dataset also includes a few tuna and shark observations.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset may be found in the data package README file and the associated publication:\nViola, B., Puskic, P., Corney, S. et al.

    "description": "This data was collected in May 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T01.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, \t   TAS, May 04, 2011\nArrived:   \tBrisbane, QLD, May 12, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This study investigated the influence of predation on the distribution of shrimp in Western Port Bay from July 1977 to January 1980. Predation by birds was determined by analysing the diets and feeding rates of the most abundant wading birds in the area, the Royal Spoonbill (Platalea regia), the White-faced Heron (Ardea novaehollandiae), and the Sacred Ibis (Threskiornis aethiopica). Predation by fish was determined by examining the gut contents of fish caught in the beam trawls. The shrimps found in the gut contents were identified and, where possible, sexed and carapace length measured. \n\nThis study found that the major consumers of shrimps were the scorpaenid, Gymnapistes marmoratus (Australian Cobbler) and the short-headed worm-eel, Muraenichthys breviceps. The Royal Spoonbill feed almost solely on M.intermdieum, whereas the other 2 species of waders feed mostly on infauna. The larger-sized individuals, which tend to be females, are subject so higher predation pressure than other groups within species.",

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "This report is part of a set delivered by Geoscience Australia on interpretation of data acquired during the summer of 2006/07 on seismic reflection, refraction and potential field survey GA-302. \n\nA 3D approach to the gravity modelling was necessitated by the irregular geological structure of depocentres and basement highs. Over 6000 m of sediment is interpreted in the deepest pockets.\n\nThe tools developed to realise the 3D gravity modelling are described in some detail. The gravity modelling process is also presented with a view to easing the integration of 3D mapping methods with a traditional reflection seismic interpretation workflow in the marine sedimentary basin environment.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",
