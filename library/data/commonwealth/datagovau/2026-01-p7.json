    "description": "\n\n\nGrasslands of the Territory include a rich assemblage of flora and fauna species that combine into a unique ecosystem. These grasslands are a priority for protection and management as they contribute to our natural biodiversity, our history and heritage, and local amenity and community. Natural Temperate Grasslands are an Endangered Ecological Community in the ACT (Nature Conservation Act 2014) and Critically Endangered Ecological Community under the EPBC Act 1999. Other native and exotic grasslands in the ACT can also have some conservation significance as they support important populations of threatened fauna and flora.\n\nNatural Temperate Grassland occurs in areas where few trees grow because of factors such as low temperatures, low rainfall and infertile or clay soils. Only 2% to 10% of the lower elevation grasslands in south-eastern Australia remain in high ecological condition, eight grassland species of the ACT are listed as endangered or vulnerable and some of the constituent plants and animals are under threat. Temperate grasslands are considered one of the most threatened Australian ecosystems. <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>. Extensive areas of native grassland in Namadgi National Park are to be field checked to determine whether they qualify as Natural Temperate Grassland. \n\nMore information on threatened species occurring in grasslands in the ACT can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>\n\nThe 2017 ACT <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/2547440/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans-2017.pdf\">Native Grassland Conservation Strategy</a> and associated action plans guide the protection, management and restoration of native grasslands and its component species for the next 10 years. See a <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans\">summary of the strategy</a>. This strategy supersedes Action Plan 28 ACT Lowland Native Grassland Conservation Strategy (Environment ACT, 2005).\n\nFit for purpose: This mapping is fit for use at a 1:10000 scale. Significant advances are being made towards a high resolution vegetation map for the ACT that is suitable for use at scales ranging from broad regional planning to local planning and property planning. However, Natural Temperate Grassland condition can fluctuate widely depending on seasonal conditions and thus boundaries and presence may fluctuate.\n\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the layers are free from error. © ACT Government\n",

    "description": "This datasets presents smooth values for the unemployment rate of Local Government Area (LGA) regions for each quarter starting December 2010 up to June 2018. The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2018 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

Dredge plums created by a cutter suction dredge were sampled from CSIRO vessel RV Linnaeus on voyage number LI2014_v11. Underway measurements were made using a ship mounted ADCP to measure vertical velocity profiles and backscatter intensity and DALEC that measured the spectral qualities of incoming and reflected sea surface light. Profile data were collected using LISST (particle size distributions)  , CTD (backscatter, temperature and salinity), Hydroscat, Hydrorad (used measure light profiles, extinction coefficients , and scattering properties). Surface and bottom water samples were be collected at selected sites and analyzed  for particle size distributions\nA mooring was deployed for 8 days in 8 metres of water. The mooring consisted of two Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADVs) and an ADCP",

It requires all new subdivision and development to be connected to reticulated sewerage where available or considered necessary on health, environment or planning grounds. \n\nWhere reticulated sewerage cannot be provided, the policy provides detailed site requirements for on-site sewage treatment and disposal.",

    "title": "DSS - Quarterly Payment Recipients (LGA) December 2017",
    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2017. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The TREND (PSRF)- Terrestrial Ecosystems project initiated a landscape-scale monitoring transect along the Adelaide Geosyncline region in southern Australia, initially spanning approximately 550 km. The aim was to examine spatial drivers of species composition and to isolate the influence of climate on whole vegetation community composition and therefore inform on-going monitoring of the impact of climate change. Specific questions were: 1. What are the most important spatial drivers of species and phylogenetic composition along landscape-scale environmental gradients? 2. Can the answer to Question 1. inform selection of suitable spatial analogues for climate change? 3. How can a framework for assessing spatial drivers be used to monitor and interpret shifts in species composition due to climate change? \nThe dataset consists of site and species records (see attachments) for plots established along the Adelaide Geosyncline for the TREND project. Data consist of vascular plant species composition (presence-abundance/absence) within 900m2 plots plus site data, including aspect and soil properties. Data have been used to analyze changes in composition with geographic and environmental differences and as a baseline for monitoring.",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the North East CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the North East Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2014. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "NSW Blue Carbon Generation from existing mangroves and saltmarsh",
    "description": "Generation is defined as the capacity for existing mangrove forests and saltmarshes to contribute to carbon additionality from living biomass, dead organic material, and soil organic carbon. Several studies indicate that carbon addition is greater in mangrove forests than saltmarshes (Chmura et al., 2003; Pendleton et al., 2012), and this is likely due to greater height and biomass of mangroves compared to herbaceous saltmarsh vegetation. In NSW where both ecosystems occur, mangroves forests typically occupy lower positions within the tidal frame than saltmarshes, and their distribution can be defined based on elevation and hydroperiod (Hughes et al., 2019). Additionally, preservation of soil organic carbon within the contemporary range of mangroves has been found to be greater within fine grained sediments of fluvial origin than sandy coastal barrier sediments. \nChmura, G.L., Anisfeld, S.C., Cahoon, D.R., and Lynch, J.C.

    "description": "The Ourimbah Creek Floodplain Risk Management Plan has been prepared for the Central Coast Council in accordance with the NSW Government’s Floodplain Development Manual 2005 (Reference 1) and:\n Is based on a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of factors that affect and are\naffected by the use of flood prone land;\n Represents the considered opinion of the local community on how to best manage its flood risk and its flood prone land; and\n Provides a long-term path for the future development of the community.\n\nThe Ourimbah Creek catchment is located on the Central Coast of NSW, approximately 90km north of Sydney. Covering a total area of 160 km2, the majority of the catchment is contained in the Wyong Shire Local Government Area (LGA), with 8 km² of the catchment contained in the Gosford City LGA to the south. In 2016 the two councils were combined into the Central Coast Council.\n\nFlooding has been recorded periodically since the 1930’s but there are many more recorded instances of flooding in Tuggerah Lakes. It is possible that the incidence of flooding has historically been under reported along Ourimbah Creek and its tributaries. In recent times there have been two significant events, in February 1990 and June 2007. In both these events there was extensive flooding in the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Wyong/Gosford regions.\n\nFlooding causes significant hardship, including both tangible and intangible damages, to the community and for this reason the Central Coast Council has undertaken a program of studies to address the management of the flood problem in accordance with the NSW Government’s Floodplain Development Manual 2005 (Reference 1).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2007 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe various projection series show the impact on the NSW population when the assumed levels of births, deaths and migration are changed. \nPopulation projections provide a picture of the population as it may develop in future years. They provide an indication of the size and age-sex structure of the future population if specified assumptions about future fertility, mortality and migration are realised. \nPopulation projections are not forecasts and do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors (whether in Australia or overseas) might have on demographic behaviour.\nFor more information please read the Population Projections User Guide.Please note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nPopulation numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. They should not be taken to be accurate to that level of detail.\n\n",

    "description": "The principal goal of this research was to investigate the most efficient, cost-effective and meaningful way of describing the structure and biodiversity of seabed habitats along the coastline of WA. This study used existing data obtained from three regions (Ningaloo, Abrolhos and Capes) to compare techniques including comparing diver vs camera-based techniques for fish. \nThe first study compared the assemblage composition, relative abundance and size of fishes sampled using baited video and diver swum transects at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands and Ningaloo. At both locations stereo BRUV recorded many more targeted fishes than stereo DOV and in greater relative abundance (e.g. Lethrinus nebulosus, Plectropomus leopardus). Many non-targeted species were also attracted to bait (e.g. Coris auricularis) and were recorded in greater abundances on stereo BRUV than stereo DOV. Stereo DOV transects recorded a greater abundance of some small-bodied Pomacentridae, Labridae and Scaridae species than did stereo BRUV, particularly at Ningaloo. This study demonstrates that choice of stereo-video sampling technique for surveys of reef fish can have a large impact on the structure of fish assemblages surveyed.\nA link to the paper \"Assessing reef fish assemblage structure: how do different stereo-video techniques compare?\" by Dianne L. Watson, Euan S. Harvey, Ben M. Fitzpatrick, Timothy J. Langlois and George Shedrawi is given in a URL below (see online resource) and provides further details\nThe second study compares baited video stations with diver swum transects across three biogeographic regions, where both methods use stereo-video techniques to provide accurate estimates of individual fish length and define the sample unit area (Langlois et al. submitted). Cost-benefit analyses showed that baited stereo-video methods were generally more cost-efficient than diver operated stereo-video transects for detecting change in the fish assemblage. The study suggests that baited stereo-video stations are, in general, a better method for monitoring fish communities than diver operated stereo-video transects.\nA link to the paper \"Cost efficient sampling of fish assemblages: comparison of baited video stations and diver video transects\" by T.J.

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016 </b>\n\nThe Coastal Hazard (Storm Tide Inundation) Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "Under Section 22 of the Education Act 1990, parents have a legal duty to ensure their school-aged children attend school. Where absenteeism is persistent and an attendance improvement plan has been unsuccessful, and the parents have not meaningfully engaged with the plan, the matter is referred for consideration of legal action.\nData Notes:\n\n\nEach school has a discipline policy which sets out clear expectations for regular student attendance and consequences of truancy.\n\n\nWhere an attendance improvement plan has been unsuccessful in resolving the matter, and the parents have not meaningfully engaged with the plan, the matter is referred for consideration of legal action. \n\n\nProceedings are typically withdrawn when attendance has improved sufficiently to justify withdrawal, or because it appeared likely that a defence could be established (e.g. illness or disobedience).\n\n\nMatters not commenced occurred for a range of reasons including not being able to serve court papers, living arrangements for child changing, Family and Community Services removing children, improvement in attendance, and the student moving out of the jurisdiction.\n\n\nThese figures were prepared from administrative systems that were developed to internally track the progress of cases rather than to report externally. There are no statistical quality assurance measures applied to these figures, and there may be anomalies or errors due to the significant number of users who access the system. The data is correct to the best of the department’s knowledge and understanding.\n\n\nRefer to the individual publications for further information and policy context.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nLegal Services Directorate. NSW Department of Education.\n",

    "description": "    \n\nSurface of predicted Available Soil Water Holding Capacity of layer 1 (A\nHorizon a Top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.\nData modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State\nand CSIRO and presented as 0.01 degree grid cells. Available water capacity\n(AWC) is a measure of the store of water available for plants to use. AWC is\npresented here as the estimated total for the horizon, measured in millimetres\n(mm). The amount of water that is held by the soil varies according to a\nnumber of soil properties including, soil texture, organic matter content,\nbulk density and soil structure development. Available water capacity has been\ncalculated as the difference in volumetric water content at 0.1 bar and 15 bar\n(matric potentials of -10 kPa and -1.5 mPa) for each layer. These represent\nrespectively the field capacity (maximum water content following free\ndrainage) and the permanent wilting point (lower limit of soil moisture\navailable to plants). The final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic\nof all of the data obtained from various state and federal agencies. The\nsurfaces have been constructed with the best available soil survey information\navailable at the time. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One\nbeing that an area weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for\nthat polygon or map-unit. Another assumption made is that the look-up tables\nprovided by McKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict\nthe soil attribute values for each soil type. The digital map data is provided\nin geographical coordinates based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)\ndatum. This raster data set has a grid resolution of 0.001 degrees\n(approximately equivalent to 1.1 km). The data set is a product of the\nNational Land and Water Resources Audit (NLWRA) as a base dataset.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_awcaar9cl\n__06111a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The study was commissioned by the Albury City Council to inform the design of the South Albury levee upgrade. \n\nThis report supersedes previous flood studies for the Murray River at Albury and provides a revised flood frequency analysis of design flows, including calibration and sensitivity testing of the hydraulic model. The modelling shows that the proposed levee upgrades lead to improved flood protection in South Albury for events up to and including the 1% AEP (Annual Exceedance Probability) event. The flood mapping produced is intended to replace existing Murray River flood mapping and is considered fit for purpose to inform the levee's design.",

    "title": "Combined Effects of near-future temperature increase and ocean acidification on coral reef foraminifera Marginopora vertebralis and Heterostegina depressa. (NERP TE 5.2, AIMS and MARUM)",
    "description": "This dataset measures 5 effects of temperature and pH stressors (individual and combined) on tropical Foraminifera. The effects measured are: respiration, survivorship, growth, chl-a content and photochemistry. The study was conducted in 2011 and the data is provided as 5 single sheet spreadsheets.\n\nWarming and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry alter marine coastal ecosystems at an accelerating pace. Here we investigate the individual effects as well as the interaction of two stressors, temperature and pH on two species of benthic coral reef Foraminifera. This study consisted of a 7 week aquarium experiment manipulating temperature and pH changes and measuring survivorship, growth, photosynthesis, respiration and chl-a content in these benthic coral reef Foraminifera.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSpecimens were collected from Orpheus Island in the central Great Barrier Reef in September 2011. H. depressa was collected at a depth of 8¿12 m from coral rubble at Cattle Bay (18°34¿08¿¿ S 146°28¿55¿¿ E) and M. vertebralis at a depth of 0¿1 m (below Lowest Astronomical Tide) from turf algae-covered rocks at Hazard Bay (18°38¿58¿¿ S 146°29¿11¿¿ E). Both species were acclimated to laboratory conditions in tanks with moderate flow-through conditions (same as used in experimental setup) under low-light conditions (10 µmol photons m-2 s-1) for a period of 3 weeks.\n12 flow-through aquaria (working volume 17.5 L) were installed in a constant temperature room, and the experiment was carried out over a period of 53 d.\n\nSpecimens were kept inside custom made flow-through housings in each aquarium to achieve higher flow conditions more closely mimicking their habitat than in previous experiments. Flow-through housings contained two levels made from two standard 6-well cell culturing plates with flow-through lids. Twenty-four specimens (four specimens per well) of H. depressa were put in the lower level and the same number of M. vertebralis in the top level.\n\nFor each temperature (28 and 31 ºC) and pCO2 level (~790 µatm, pHNIST 7.9 and ~490 µatm, pHNIST 8.1), three replicate tanks were used; replicate tanks were randomly allocated to treatments. Seawater was pumped from the ocean into the laboratory, filtered to 5 µm, and stored in four header tanks where it was modified to the desired experimental conditions. Manual temperature and pH measurements were performed once to twice per day. Water samples for total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) determinations were taken weekly and analysed by AIMS Laboratory Services.\n\nFlow rates into the individual wells were recorded before and after the experiment, ranging between 180 and 220 mL min-1. Velocity of the water flow varied from 4.2¿5.2 9 10-1 m s-1 at the inlet (Ø 0.3 cm) to 3.1¿3.8 9 10-3 m s-1 at the outlet (Ø 3.5 cm). The flow rates between inlet and outlet are in the same range as those measured in situ over dead coral rubble and sea grass.\n\nFlow-through housings were made containing two levels so that one species could be kept in the top level exposed to higher light levels than the species in the lower level. Light levels were chosen for each species separately because of their known distributions and different light saturation points determined by pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry. PAM fluorometry results for M. vertebralis indicated a maximum saturating irradiance (Ek) between 100 and 140 µmol photons m-2 s-1 and for H. depressa between 40 and 60 µmol photons m-2 s-1 (Ziegler and Uthicke 2011). The light levels used in the experiment were chosen to fall below the Ek values by Ziegler and Uthicke (2011) and P¿I curve Pmax values determined by Vogel and Uthicke (2012) and were selected to correspond to levels which have shown no changes in mortality rates or chlorophyll a concentrations in previous experimental manipulations of the studied species.\n\nFurther detail can be found in this publication:\nSchmidt, C., Kucera, M., & Uthicke, S.

    "description": "As part of the Jobs for Canberrans Fund, announced in 2020, an audit occurred of bike paths and footpaths in Canberra. The audit was primarily focused on asset performance data to inform future asset management activities. To supplement the asset performance information, the audit also captured potential defects for further investigation by a suitably qualified officer. The findings from this audit represent a snapshot in time and don’t reflect the current situation.\n\nThis dataset identifies potential defects requiring further investigation by a qualified officer. Community path defects are managed in an ongoing manner through the Transport Canberra and City Services Asset Management System.",

    "description": "This database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:100 000 scale) detailing places of potential National Estate aesthetic significance.\n\nAesthetic value is the response derived from the experience of the environment or particular natural and cultural attributes within it. This response can be to either visual or non-visual elements and can embrace emotional response, sense of place, sound, smell and any other factors having a strong impact on human thought, feelings and attitudes. (Australian Heritage Commission & Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 1994, p. 5) \n\nBefore the Comprehensive Regional Assessment (CRA), some 80 forest places having National Estate aesthetic significance had been identified in Tasmania. In most instances, however, this value had not been identified or corroborated through community consultation; rather, it had been determined through assessment by natural environment heritage experts. The information gathered during the CRA process, which enhances understanding of the significance of these places, will be amalgamated with existing information and may be used to refine the boundaries of places already on the Register of the National Estate. \n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criterion E1: Importance for a community for aesthetic characteristics held in high esteem or otherwise valued by the community.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "River basin catchment areas for Melbourne.  This layer has two intended purposes: To provide a readily available amalgamation of MWC_Catchments that make up the river basins within Melbourne Water’s area. Useful for larger scale plans and maps.Data for basin boundaries have been captured by relevant State and Territory authorities from 1:10 000 and 1:250 000 scale source material. The balance of the data are from Geoscience Australia's GEODATA Coast 100K which includes coastlines and State and Territory borders. Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Region boundaries are updated based on current research, data and technology. It references previous work of the Australian Water Resources Management Committee as shown in Australia's River Basins 1997. This work is a collaboration of scientists from the Bureau of Meteorology, Australian National University Fenner School of Environment and Society, CSIRO Water for Healthy Country Flagship and Geoscience Australia.In late 2008, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), in partnership with Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and the Australian National University (ANU) commenced the development of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric). Geofabric is being developed to underpin the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS) within a single, consistent, national geospatial framework for hydrological features. Geoscience Australia's role in the Geofabric is to provide the best available national topographic spatial data for surface water features based on the National Topographic Data and Map Specifications. The river basin boundaries have been aligned (by Melbourne Water) to Melbourne Water Corporation (MWC) drainage catchments, to produce a consistent drainage and waterways catchment dataset to State level, since 2005.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data. Melbourne Water Corporation shall not be liable in any way to any person or group for loss of any kind including damages, costs, interest, loss of profits or special loss or damage, arising from any use, error, inaccuracy, incompleteness or other defect in this data.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a property level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and projections for energy consumption have been made for between 2016 and 2026, based on a business-as-usual scenario. It does not include the industrial sector.",

    "description": "SandMap Pty Ltd has been contracted by Moreton Bay Regional Council to undertake investigation surveys into multiple sites located close offshore from the Redcliffe Peninsula, QLD. These surveys will inform coastal modelling currently being undertaken as part of coastal design projects and may also be used to set-out coastal protection structures such as groyne extensions and seawalls encroaching below the low tide mark. \n\nThe survey requirements were to provide enough coverage within marked survey extents and high priority areas for each site to capture key bed features and the toe of any coastal structures up to -0.5m AHD. Additionally, the fringes of reefs within the marked areas were to be captured. To supplement this data, a number of survey profiles were specified for capture. The survey to be carried out to Class D requirements.\n\nThis site, Woody Point, refers to a 2.2km x 0.6km long section of coastline on the southern tip of the Redcliffe Peninsula and incorporates the Woody Point jetty. The survey area as identified through the specifications, including profiles, is contained within an area of 1.9km by 1.6km.",

The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nGloucester Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input  and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.  The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of  equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. The surface water component of the zone was derived by selecting assessment units within 150m or sharing an alluvial floodplain with an impacted river reach.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing tweaks were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nA selection buffer of 300m was created from the potentially impacted reaches of the surface water modelling interpolated reaches polylines. This was unioned with polygons in the alluvium layer that intersected with the potentially impacted reaches to create the composite selection layer (included in component layer folder). The composite selection layer was manually edited to constrain the extent to that reasonably potentially influenced by changes in river. \n\n\n\nThe composite selection layer was used to select, by intersection, AUs that represented the surface water\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) GLO ZoPHC and component layers 20170217.

    "description": "We request 15 hours of observing time with the Parkes UWL receiver (700-4000 MHz) to investigate frequency-dependent eclipsing in three spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs): one redback and two black widows. Spider MSPs commonly exhibit frequency-dependent eclipsing, which provides insights into their dense, magnetized plasma environments. We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "Live release 1.0\r\n\r\nThis APS Career Pathfinder dataset contains the capability frameworks, role definitions and learning catalogues used by the [APS Career Pathfinder](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/aps-career-pathfinder-tool) tool to facilitate career exploration and development in the Australian Public Service (APS).\r\n\r\nThe role definitions include typical APS roles, which describe the skills and general capability requirements typically found in APS jobs based on those roles. You can use these definitions to determine potential career pathways and identify skills gaps and learning solutions that may help fill those gaps.\r\n\r\nThe focus at present is on digital roles, and therefore the capability frameworks, role definitions and the learning catalogue we are using primarily address digital, data and ICT. However, the APS Career Pathfinder tool has the capability to work with other types of capability framework, with roles and leaning mapped accordingly, so that it can support career exploration and development in potentially any area of capability.\r\n\r\nWe’ve defined roles according to skills drawn from capability frameworks, primarily [SFIA](https://sfia-online.org/en/), the Skills Framework for the Information Age. We use additional capability frameworks where relevant, including other skills frameworks (like [CIISec](https://www.ciisec.org/), the Chartered Institute of Information Security skills framework, and the [DCF](https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-data-capability-framework) Data Capability Framework), knowledge frameworks (like our simple knowledge magnitude scale), and behaviours (using the APS Work Level Standards). Additional details about roles include:\r\n\r\n* a brief description of each role or discipline\r\n* a mapping to the APS Job Family Model\r\n* a mapping to areas of interest\r\n* alternative names the roles may have\r\n* link to a ‘day in the life of’ profile for certain roles\r\n* relative role demand\r\n* link to learning solutions related to each role\r\n\r\nWe may define roles as typical APS roles, which are not specific to any agency, or as agency-specific roles. Agencies can include their role definitions in this dataset by sending their definitions to the contact email below.\r\n\r\nPlease send requests to change or augment any of this data to the contact email below. We may consult with our community before including them.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes the full SFIA framework, reproduced and made available through the [SFIA-AU](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/skills-framework-information-age) license. Use throughout Australia is permitted through this license, but may be restricted for foreign and multi-national organisations.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions. Various sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.",

    "description": "BMAP Assets are assets at risk of bushfire, as identified in South Australia's nine Bushfire Management Area Plans (BMAPs). Each BMAP asset is assigned a risk rating of either low, medium, high, very high, or extreme. Assets may be assigned risk reduction treatments to reduce their level of risk. Where risk reduction treatments are assigned, the agency or agencies responsible for the treatment are also specified. BMAP Assets are captured in three datasets: BMAP Asset Points, BMAP Asset Lines, and BMAP Asset Polygons. This allows assets to be represented as either points (for example, a communication tower) lines (for example, a pipeline) or polygons (for example, an area of houses located at an urban/rural fringe). Assets are broadly categorised according to their value as either a \"Human Settlement\", \"Economic Value\", or \"Social Value\" asset. This is referred to as the \"Asset Type\". There is one other Asset Type, \"Environmental\", however due to the very large number of environmental assets, those assets are stored in a separate dataset named BMAP Environmental Assets. BMAPs are defined in Section 73A of the Fire and Emergency Services Act 2005. BMAPs can be viewed on the Bushfire Management Area Plans page on the State Bushfire Coordination Committee (SBCC) website. Further information is available on the SBCC website. In particular, the publication named \"The Bushfire Management Area Plan Handbook 2018\" provides more information about BMAP Asset data.",

    "description": "Boating activity on Victoria's waterways is governed by rules that are determined by Transport Safety Victoria in accordance with the powers of the Marine Safety Act 2010 (Vic). Those rules are published as the Vessel Operating and Zoning Rules (VOZR). The VOZR determines safe speed  and distance rules for Victoria's waterways and determines zones that are set aside for special purposes. These zones can include areas determined for exclusive use such as rowing only zones or zones that prohibit boating such as a swimming only zone. The VOZR is a documentary description of the rules and zones. This data is a geographical representation of those zones and includes polygons depicting the size and shapes of zones. Also contained within the dataset is point data that provides information regarding assets that are used to delineate zones and provide information to boaters to help identify the presence of those zones (such as a buoy on the water to show the corner of a zone). \nThe data has been collected by TSV as part of its audit program for monitoring compliance of the activities of local waterway managers. The data is not a complete GIS data set for Victoria's scheduled waterways and has been collected since 2008. The data is being periodically updated as audit activity collects new data. The data has not been collected with the express purpose of publication of this data. Any potential users may be required to apply an intrepretive process in order for the data to be re-purposed. TSV is currently undertaking a project to convert this data into a published waterways online system. As that project progresses, the information supplied with this data will improve. ",

    "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Synthesizing three decades of seagrass spatial data from Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait have globally significant seagrass habitat that provide food for threatened dugong and turtle, and habitat for commercially important fish and prawns. Key to understanding, managing, mitigating risk, and monitoring seagrass in this remote region is reliable data on seagrass distribution and species composition and how these changes through time. Data on seagrass has been collected in these areas since the 1980s, but data location and storage from these efforts remains disparate, in many cases not publicly available, and in some cases has already been lost. Our study will compile, validate and synthesize historical seagrass spatial data to create a publicly available database accessible on eAtlas. This product will provide end-users with a valuable spatial resource to assist management and monitoring of seagrass in the region. \n\n(i) Identify key seagrass habitat and migration corridors for dugong and turtles in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\n(ii) Identify regions where seagrass information is deficient (knowledge gaps)\n(iii) create a foundations for models assessing exposure to risk (water quality and other environmental impacts, climate change, etc)\n(iv) provide essential information for management, planning, and developing long-term monitoring plans\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • seagrass data [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC11) was collected from a depth of 502 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~30cm depth. From matching the 18O G. ruber curve with Martinson et al. (1987), 4 glacial cycles can be determined, incorporating Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 1 through to MIS 11. Isotopically heavier 18O values at ~460cm, ~345cm, 150cm, and 30cm correspond respectively to MIS 10, MIS 8, MIS 6 and the LGM. The d13C shows a trough lagging behind the 18O high during the glacial, although there are considerable fluctuations between MIS 8 and 6.",

    "description": "We request 15 hours of observing time with the Parkes UWL receiver (700-4000 MHz) to investigate frequency-dependent eclipsing in three spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs): one redback and two black widows. Spider MSPs commonly exhibit frequency-dependent eclipsing, which provides insights into their dense, magnetized plasma environments. We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "The Study Area\n\nThe study area comprises four sub-catchments within the Canterbury-Bankstown Council Local Government Area (LGA) that drain to Prospect Creek:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Georges Hall Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering approximately 145 hectares, this area predominantly features residential land with notable reserves, such as Crest Reserve and Garrison Point Reserve.</li>\n<li><strong>Lansdowne Sub-Catchment</strong>: Spanning 243 hectares, it includes residential areas alongside significant bushland and parklands, such as Lansdowne Park and Mirambeena Regional Park.</li>\n<li><strong>Miller Road Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering 50 hectares, this area includes residential zones with no defined water channels, relying on overland flow paths and a piped drainage network.</li>\n<li><strong>Villawood Sub-Catchment</strong>: The largest at approximately 740 hectares, this area comprises residential and industrial zones with a network of concrete-lined open channels.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA map of the study area is shown in Figure 1-2.\n\nConsultation\n\nCommunity and stakeholder consultation has been integral to this project. Key consultation activities included:\n<ul>\n<li>Engagement with the Floodplain Management Committee throughout the project phases;</li>\n<li>Community feedback collected through online surveys, email submissions, and in-person sessions, with a total of 67 recorded responses during initial consultation;</li>\n<li>Public exhibition of the draft study and plan, incorporating input from 57 engagements; and</li>\n<li>Targeted discussions on identified issues, such as voluntary house raising and stormwater management concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n\nModelling of Flood Behaviour\n\nCanterbury-Bankstown Council has implemented a consistent and advanced approach for modelling stormwater catchment flooding. The methodology integrates a dynamically linked 2D/1D hydrodynamic model (TUFLOW), which simulates flood behaviours with precision.\n\nThe TUFLOW model uses a two-dimensional grid to represent surface terrain while incorporating one-dimensional elements for stormwater pipes and channels. Overflow from drainage elements is accounted for, allowing flows to spill onto the grid and replicate overland and sheet flows across floodplains.\n\nFlood Risk Mapping &amp; Development Controls\n\nFlood risk mapping for the Prospect Creek sub-catchments categorises the area into three flood risk precincts, guiding development controls:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Areas prone to significant flood damages and evacuation challenges, where development is generally restricted.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Zones with moderate risk, where damages can be mitigated with suitable controls.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Regions with minimal risk where most developments are permitted, subject to planning regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAdditionally, overland flow precincts have been identified to account for shallow inundation areas, enabling tailored development controls.\n\nThe Flood Problem\n\nA comprehensive flood damages database was developed to evaluate flood impacts and inform flood mitigation strategies. Key findings include:\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 2,667 properties are impacted in the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event, with over 60% located in the Villawood sub-catchment.</li>\n<li>Average Annual Damages (AAD) across the sub-catchments exceed $93.7 million, with the Villawood sub-catchment contributing a significant portion due to its low-lying industrial areas.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFlood mitigation measures were assessed, and recommendations for effective floodplain management have been outlined to address these challenges.",
