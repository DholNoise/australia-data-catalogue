The area completely contains the Gloucester Geological Basin. The PEL area excludes existing mining leases (except Stratford Colliery), National Parks, state forest or nature reserves, Aboriginal areas and land vested in the Commonwealth of Australia. There are no World Heritage Areas or Ramsar Wetlands within the PEL. The PEL overlays the Local Government Areas of the Gloucester Shire and Great Lakes Council. \n\n\n\nPEL 285 was granted in 1992 under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act, 1991. In December 2008 AGL Energy acquired PEL 285 from the joint venture of Lucas \n\nEnergy and Molopo to become the sole operator. The licence enables investigation of the potential for coal seam methane resources in the Gloucester Basin with a view to possible development of a coal seam methane production field in the near future. All exploration works are to be undertaken in accordance with Licence conditions \n\nthat are imposed by the Minister for Primary Industries and with the works program agreed with DPI.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nPEL 285 was granted in 1992 under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act, 1991.

    "description": "This dataset presents the location of Queensland state schools with February full-time enrolments by year level for the years 2017-2018.\nThe Queensland Department of Education takes two main snapshots of state school enrolments in February and August.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - Student Enrolments February.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Queensland Department of Education - State and Non State School Listings.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nFrom 2015, students enrolled at State Special schools are recorded against their age or ability appropriate year level as determined by their school.\n\n\nFrom 2015, Year 7 became the first year of high school in Queensland.\n\n\nA half cohort of Prep was introduced in 2007 to align with the shift in the compulsory school starting age from 2008. In 2018, the half cohort is in Year 11.\n\n\nThe school structure in this cube is as at February 2018; historical data has been combined for schools which have been amalgamated. For this reason schools which were created by an amalgamation may have enrolments for years prior to opening.\n\n\nThe number of schools in this dataset may differ from school count data. There are a small number of schools with students attending from other schools on a needs basis and do not have enrolments of their own. The Lady Cilento Children's Hospital School does not have enrolments of their own.\n\n",

    "title": "Lake Macquarie LGA Vegetation Community Map 2022 VIS_ID 5117 - Version 2",
    "description": "This dataset comprises of native vegetation communities within the boundaries of native vegetation extant in the Lake Macquarie City Council (LMCC) Local Government Area (LGA). These communities were originally mapped by Stephen Bell and Collin Driscoll using the methodology outlined in Bell, S.A.J. &amp; Driscoll, C. (2016) and are as amended by LMCC by bi-annual review.\n\nThe methodology is a composite of field survey (rapid data points) and vegetation mapping from various reports. Additional edits have been made by LMCC where attribution and/or lineage has found to be in error, or more intensive field site survey has been undertaken. Native vegetation extant is derived from the LMCC Native Vegetation and Corridor mapping (updated using 2022 nearmap imagery).\n\nThe internal Map Unit (MU) delineation accuracy varies according to the source data at each point.  The intention is to improve accuracy over time. The accuracy of the vegetation extant is &lt;10m. All data requires careful interpretation with consideration of the accuracy field at any location. Full floristic plot survey and multivariate analysis has not been undertaken for many of the map units, hence their position in the classification hierarchy requires further confirmation.  This dataset should not be used as a substitute for full site-specific floristic survey using standard techniques (quadrats &amp; transects etc) and should be used in conjunction with the supporting reports.\n\nThe vegetation community classification system used is LHCCREMS (NPWS) 2000, with subgroups and additional communities where no equivalent exists to form LMCC Map Units (MU). Equivalent NSW State Government Plant Community Types (PCTs) were assigned to LMCC vegetation community map units by S. Bell with varying degrees of confidence:\n<ul>\n<li>High matches are generally those where sufficient similarities are evident;</li>\n<li>Medium, where some uncertainties are present; and</li>\n<li>Low where there is considerable doubt over the match, but due to the absence of better matches these have been selected.</li>\n<li>“No clear match” is for map units that occur in a very small area of the City and given they are local variations cannot be assigned to broader based PCT classification.</li>\n</ul>\n\nNationally listed Threatened Endangered Ecological Communities (TECs) are indicative only, and require onsite investigation. For Nationally listed species composition, condition, connectivity and patch size need to be verified in accordance with the relevant conservation advice.  TECs are based in the first instance on the LMCC Map Unit. Where the LMCC Map Unit has not been assigned to a TEC but the equivalent eastern NSW PCT lists an associated Threatened Ecological Community, the TEC is listed in this dataset with the suffix “(possible, from PCT)”.\n\nVersion 2 changes:\nIn 2023 amendments were made to the mapping, with the updated version titled “Lake Macquarie LGA Vegetation Community Map 2022 – Version 2”. These amendments include:\n<ul>\n<li>Inclusion of data fields relating to the eastern NSW PCTs, including E. NSW PCT ID, E. NSW PCT Name and Confidence in the E. NSW PCT assigned to each LMCC map unit.</li>\n<li>Incorporation of Saltmarsh and Mangrove polygons identified by NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) as part of their estuary habitat mapping in 2022.</li>\n<li>Field checking and adjustment of some vegetation communities in the vicinity of South Creek, Eleebana, in response to a request by Lake Macquarie Landcare.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor more information including conversion tables between LMCC map units and Plant Communities and supporting reports see: https://www.lakemac.com.au/Development/Planning-controls/Local-Planning-Controls/Development-Guidelines or contact Lake Macquarie Council council@lakemac.nsw.gov.au\n\nVIS_ID 5117",

    "title": "IMOS - SRS Satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) sub-facility",
    "description": "As part of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the Australian Bureau of Meteorology produce high-resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products over the Australian region, designed to suit a range of operational and research applications.  All these products follow the latest International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST: www.ghrsst.org) file formats, assisting international data exchange and collaboration.\nThe highest spatial resolution (1 km x 1 km) data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors on NOAA polar-orbiting satellites can only be obtained through receiving direct broadcast “HRPT” data from the satellite.  In Australia, HRPT data is received by a number of agencies (Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia, AIMS and CSIRO) and consortia (WASTAC and TERSS) at ground-stations located in Darwin, Townsville, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth and Alice Springs and in Antarctica at Casey and Davis Stations.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology, in collaboration with CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, is combining raw data from the various ground-stations and producing real-time HRPT AVHRR skin (~ 10 micron depth) SST data files in the GHRSST GDS v2.0 L2P (single swath, geolocated), L3U (single swath, gridded), one and three day daytime/night-time L3C (single sensor, multiple swath, gridded) and one, three and six day daytime/night-time L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swath, gridded) formats.  The L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files for NOAA-15, 17, 18 and 19 satellite data are available through the IMOS FTP server (ftp://aodaac2-cbr.act.csiro.au/imos/GHRSST), IMOS AO-DAAC (http://www.marine.csiro.au/remotesensing/imos/aggregator.html# ) and IMOS Ocean Portal (http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/), and will eventually be available through the GHRSST Global Data Assembly Centre (http://ghrsst.jpl.nasa.gov).  Archived raw HRPT AVHRR data from Australian and Antarctic ground-stations back to 1992 will be progressively reprocessed into skin SST L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files and be available to GHRSST and IMOS by June 2013.\nFor the user, there are several advantages to using GHRSST-format SST products.  For each SST value the GHRSST files contain a quality level flag (based on proximity to cloud, satellite zenith angle and day/night) and bias and standard deviation error estimates based on 60 day match-ups with drifting buoy SST data.  Note that the closer an SST pixel is to cloud, the higher the standard deviation.  Therefore, the presence of these quality level flags and error information enable users to tailor the L2P, L3U, L3C or L3S files for their particular research application by trading SST spatial coverage for accuracy and vice versa.  Users have the ability to access L3U, L3C and L3S SST products through IMOS OPeNDAP servers, greatly simplifying data access and extraction.  Providing real-time HRPT AVHRR SST files in GHRSST-L2P format enables them to be incorporated into global and regional, gap-free, analyses of L2P SST from multiple satellites such as NASA’s G1SST global 1 km daily SST analysis and the Bureau of Meteorology’s daily regional and global SST analyses (RAMSSA and GAMSSA).\nThe new IMOS AVHRR L2P SSTs exhibit approximately 75% the error of the Bureau’s pre-existing HRPT AVHRR level 2 SST data, with standard deviations compared with drifting buoys during night-time of around 0.3°C and during daytime of around 0.4°C for quality level 5 (highest). This significant improvement in accuracy has been achieved by improving cloud clearing and calibration - using regional rather than global drifting buoy SST observations and incorporating a dependence on latitude.\nFor further details on the AVHRR GHRSST products see Paltoglou et al. (2010) (http://imos.org.au/srsdoc.html).  Enquiries can be directed to Helen Beggs (h.beggs(at)bom.gov.au).\n\n\nAll the IMOS satellite SST products are supplied in GHRSST netCDF format and are either geolocated swath (\"L2P\") files or level 3 composite, gridded files that will have gaps where there were no observations during the specified time period.  The various L3U (single swath), L3C (single sensor, multiple swath) and L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swaths) are designed to suit different applications.  Some current applications of the various IMOS satellite SST products are:\n\nHRPT AVHRR data:\n\nL2P: Ingestion into optimally interpolated SST analysis systems (eg. RAMSSA, GAMSSA, G1SST, ODYSSEA);\n\nL3U: Calculation of surface ocean currents (IMOS OceanCurrents);\n\nL3C: Estimation of diurnal warming of the surface ocean (GHRSST Tropical Warm Pool Diurnal Variation (TWP+) Project);\n\nL3S: Estimation of likelihood of coral bleaching events (ReefTemp II).\n\nL3P: Legacy 14-day Mosaic AVHRR SST which is a weighted mean SST produced daily from multiple NOAA satellites in a cut-down GHRSST netCDF format.  This product is still used in a coral bleaching prediction system run at CMAR.  The product is produced using the legacy BoM processing system and is less accurate than the new IMOS L3S product.\n\nGeostationary satellite MTSAT-1R data:\n\nL3U: Hourly, 0.05 deg x 0.05 deg SST used for estimation of the diurnal warming of the surface ocean and validation of diurnal warming models (TWP+ Project).",

    "title": "Tide Gauge Records, Macquarie Island",
    "description": "Tides are recorded at Macquarie Island using two sensors, one an acoustic height measuring system and the other a pressure measuring system. The raw records are stored at AADC.\n      The records are processed by The National Tidal Centre to produce tidal records, predictions and residuals.\n        \n      Documentation dated 2001-06-12\n      The Macquarie Island Tide Gauge System\n      \n      The Macquarie Island Tide Gauge was first commissioned in November 1993. Since then every year attempts have been made to improve the performance of the system.\n      The next improvement involves the installation of radio modems to effect a network link to the tide gauge dataloggers. Other improvements planned are include using the wave guide temperatures to correct the water heights for variations in the velocity of sound in air due to temperature gradients in the waveguide. \n      The system consists of two separate sensors contained in separate housings on a rock shelf on the northern side of Garden Cove. One of the sensors is an Aquatrack acoustic type and the other is a Druck pressure transducer. Both housings contain a Platypus Engineering data logger and a battery. The housings consist each of an Admiralty Bronze ring bolted down to a concrete plinth and a glass fibre reinforced cover held down by a single central bolt and nut. \n      Primary power for both installations comes from a solar panel array mounted on the northern side of the rock ridge behind the rock shelf. The solar panels are attached to an aluminium frame which is bolted to a galvanized steel frame cemented into holes in the rock face. The bolts are made of nylon with nylon washers so that the aluminium frame is not in contact with the galvanized frame.\n      Mounted below the panels is a sealed plastic box with a hinged door. A multicore data cable runs from this box to the tide gauge housings. This cable is run inside a length of plastic conduit along with the power cable. The conduit is concealed in the vegetation and at the lower level is cemented into slots cut into the rock\n      The batteries in the housing are kept charged by the solar panels but are isolated via power diodes, one in each housing. Either or both of the housing batteries or only the solar panel battery may be removed without interruption to data logging. The voltage of either housing battery may be found by interrogation of the appropriate data logger.\n      \n      Tide Gauge Bore Holes.\n      \n      Both gauges obtain access to the ocean via an inclined hole about 12 metres long inclined at approximately 34 and 39 degrees to the horizontal. Both holes are lined with a plastic pipe which is normally not removable. In the Aquatrack sensor hole a 50mm ABS pressure pipe runs down inside the liner and is fitted with a brass strainer and orifice at the lower end. This strainer protrudes into the ocean somewhat clear of the sea floor (see figure). Inside the 50mm pipe runs a 15mm diameter plastic pipe. The bottom end of this is fitted with a 600mm length of red brass tubing and stops about 100mm from the orifice at the bottom of the pipe. The 15mm pipe is held central in the 50mm pipe by three armed spiders placed about every metre down the pipe. The top end of both pipes is secured by a flange with two O rings and stainless steel screws. On top of the 15mm pipe is mounted the Aquatrack acoustic sensor the 15mm pipe acting as a waveguide for sound pulses from the sensor (see figure ). The Aquatrack sensor measures the distance of the water surface from a reference point on the sensor. About one metre down the wave guide is a small hole. This has two functions. One is to act as vent to allow water to rise and fall in the wave guide and the other is to provide an acoustic reflection at a known distance down the wave guide. This allows compensation for velocity of sound changes due to temperature changes.\n      The Aquatrak wave guide has a series of thermistors placed along its length. The bottom one is always submerged and is used to measure the seawater temperature..The top one is placed just below the Sensor and the others evenly spaced along the length of the waveguide. The temperature readings from these can be used to compensate for the change in the velocity of sound due to density changes. This feature has not yet been used.\n      The Druck Sensor has a single thermistor placed beside it which measures seawater temperature.\n      \n      System Components. \n      \n      The Aquatrak Installation houses four main components.\n      1. The Aquatrack Sensor and Waveguide Assembly. The sensor itself is in a waterproof plastic tube with a cable with a waterproof connector which plugs into the Bartek controller.\n      2. The Bartek Controller, housed in a waterproof diecast box with waterproof connectors. This lies in the centre of the installation housing.\n      3. The Platypus Engineering Datalogger \n      4. The Battery, a 15 Ah, 12 volt sealed gel cell lead acid battery. It is charged from the solar a diode. The battery lies in the main housing opposite the Datalogger .\n      \n      The Druck Installation houses four main components\n      1. The Druck Pressure Sensor, fitted to the end of a 13 metre cable, submerged in seawater about 10 metres down the borehole.\n      The cable has five conductors and an air vent enclosed within it.\n      2. The Pressure Sensor Amplifier housed in a waterproof diecast box. This box has a vent leading to a vented bottle filled with silica gel to keep the transducer air vent dry.\n      3. A Datalogger As above.\n      4. A battery as above \n      \n      The Solar Panel Installation has three main parts.\n      1. Three Photo Voltaic Solar Panels, two 60 Watt and one 30 Watt. These are mounted on an aluminium frame attached to a hotdip galvanised steel frame with insulating bolts. \n      2. A sealed plastic box mounted below the panels containing a12V 24 Ah Battery and a regulator and the radio modem equipment. (The modems are not currently fitted.)\n      3. Antennae and cables protected with flexible conduit.\n      Data Retrieval\n      \n      Data have been retrieved at approximately 30 day intervals from the Garden Cove gauges by using a portable computer to download the data loggers. The connector for this is in the enclosure by the solar panels allowing the loggers to be accessed during bad weather.\n      \n      Documentation dated 2008-10-17\n      1. In April 2007, the dataloggers and radio modems at Macquarie Island Tide Gauge site were replaced with Campbell Scientific CR1000 dataloggers.\n      2. This change enabled data to be streamed from the pressure sensor datalogger every 30 seconds.\n      3. There has been no change to scaling of records from the Aquatrak sensor as generation of ranges is done by the Aquatrak controller, the datalogger only saving and transmitting the records.\n       Records from the pressure sensor however are now not converted to heights but saved and streamed as raw A/D conversion values.\n       It is intended that appropriate scales and offsets for this sensor be derived after a Floating GPS Buoy exercise.\n      4. Data is streamed from the pressure sensor logger as this is the only sensor that can be supply 30 seconds average values.\n          This logger also streams 3 minute average values.\n      5. The aquatrak sensor logger streams 3 minute average value ranges.\n      6. Data is streamed in NVP (name/Value Pair) format as defined by BoM.\n      7. Embedded in the streams are battery voltage and aquatrak waveguide temperature values.",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Pilbara array, in combination with the Kimberly array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Pilbara line will help document the variability  in the the northward flowing Ningaloo Current, characterised by cooler waters. In addition, the Pilbara coast is characterised by high evaporation, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the nominated Subtropical and Temperate Coastal Saltmarsh found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n * Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n* The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n * Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n* While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

    "description": "<em>Complete report</em>\n\nThe Albury Floodplain Risk Management Study assesses floodplain management issues in the Albury LGA, and investigates potential management options for the area. The study, which follows on from the flood studies undertaken for the area, has been undertaken in accordance with the NSW Government’s Flood Prone Land Policy. A full assessment of the existing flood risk in the catchment has been carried out, including flood hazard across the various catchments, overfloor flooding of residential, commercial and industrial properties, identification of known flooding issues and hotspots, and emergency response during a flood event. A range of measures aimed at managing this flood risk were also assessed for their efficacy across a range of criteria, which will allow options to be recommended as part of the Floodplain Risk Management Plan for the area. Measures included upgrade of the South Albury levee, retarding basins, pit and pipe upgrades and various property modification measures.",

    "description": "We propose to continue undertake a pulsar survey along the Galactic Plane using the new Methanol Multibeam receiver in order to uncover pulsars previously selected against in lower frequency surveys. The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies. Simulations have shown that we expect to find a total of 200 pulsars of which about one half will be new detections.",

    "description": "This data release is part of the Federal Government’s Exploring for the Future program undertake by Geoscience Australia in collaboration with the Northern Territory Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Queensland. It is the second staged release of data from the North Australian Geochemical Survey which sampled catchment outlet sediments at 780 sites (including duplicates) for geochemical analysis.\n\nThe survey area was chosen to encompass the preeminent mineral provinces of Tennant Creek and Mt Isa, with the region between these two provinces providing a vast prospective exploration frontier, covered by a thin veneer of sediments and basalts, which has been overlooked for mineral exploration in the past.\nThe data are not only useful for mineral exploration but also for agriculture and environmental management. For agriculture, this dataset can be used to assess soil fertility to maintain sustainable crop production and inform cattle grazing management over such areas as the Barkly Tablelands. The survey establishes a robust geochemical baseline dataset relevant to many environmental issues which can be utilised in development decision making into the future.\n\nThis data release includes (1) results of the total chemical analyses of the coarse (&lt;2 mm) fraction of sampled sediments (XRF, ICP-MS), (2) results of the aqua regia analyses of the coarse and fine fractions (&lt;2 mm and &lt;75 µm, respectively), and (3) results of the fire assay analysis of the coarse and fine fractions. Included is a set of georeferenced digital images of geochemical maps based on this dataset.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. The metadata was not provided by the data supplier and has been compiled by the programme based on known details.\n\n\n\nThis dataset was created for the Galilee subregion by performing the Tasselled Cap Index on Landsat data using Digital Earth Australia (DEA) to create a wetness summary image. This wetness summary image identifies open water or wet vegetation presence in pixel by proportion of images in which pixel exceeded tasselled cap wetness threshold over 30 year archive.\n\n\n\nDEA is an analysis platform for satellite imagery and other Earth observations. Today, it translates 30 years of Earth observation data (taken every two weeks at 25 metre squared resolution) and tracks changes across Australia in unprecedented detail, identifying soil and coastal erosion, crop growth, water quality, and changes to cities and regions.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe tasselled cap wetness in the landscape summary output is produced using DEA. Landsat surface reflectance data at 25 m resolution with information in the red, green, blue, near infra-red and short-wave infra-red spectral bands are retrieved from the DEA archive using a spatial query for Galilee subregion. Clouds and areas of terrain shadow are masked from the surface reflectance data. A tasselled cap transformation is performed on each of the surface reflectance bands to produce a per-pixel 'wetness' value. This method is based on the tasselled cap transformation of Crist EP (1985) A TM tasselled cap equivalent transformation for reflectance factor data. Remote Sensing of Environment 17(3), 301-306, but only uses the component of transformed surface reflectance in the 'wetness' direction to identify the presence of water and wet vegetation.\n\nAreas of water and wet vegetation are highlighted where pixels exceed a specified wetness threshold. Pixels exceeding the wetness threshold are counted through the temporal image archive. This count is then normalised by the number of times that the pixel was observed (cloud free). The wetness in the landscape summary is then presented as the percentage of scenes where the pixel has contained water or wet vegetation through time. Selecting a spatial transect of interest (e.g. a line that follows a river, or crosses a wetland or spring) allows for retrieval of the wetness threshold data for each image pixel along the transect line.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2017) Galilee normed TCI landsat and traverses.

The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies. Simulations have shown that we expect to find a total of 200 pulsars of which about one half will be new detections.",

    "title": "Vegetation cover condition (Cooper region)",
    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nVegetation cover condition is an assessment of how much impact disturbances (including management activities) have had on ground cover. Condition is assessed using Compere, a relative performance bench marking framework that compares one location's value to the values of all biophysically equivalent locations in a given region. Resulting condition estimates range from 0 (lowest observed cover among equivalents) to 1 (highest observed). Underlying total vegetation cover data are the total fraction of ground covered by green and senesced plant material (Guerschman et al., 2018, Remote Sensing of Environment 113, 928-945). Cover condition has been assessed yearly from 2001 to 2018 at a grid resolution of 500 m.  \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nAnnual rainfall, historical NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), slope and total cover fraction data were used to calculate cover condition.  Annual rainfall was from the Bureau of Meteorology daily 5 km gridded data (Jeffrey et al., 2001).  NDVI was from MODIS MOD13Q1 and MOD09Q1 data.  Slope was from the CSIRO’s SRTM 9 digital elevation model data (Gallant et al., 2011).  Cover was from CSIRO’s fractional cover data (derived from MCD43A4 data, Guerschman and Hill, 2018).\r\nSurface Water Points data and the Sturt National Park boundary data were used to test results.  These were sourced from Crossman and Li (2015) and Commonwealth of Australia (2019), respectively.\r\nBackground NDVI, slope and annual rainfall were used quantify locations that were biophysically equivalent to a given target location.  The total cover fraction of the target was compared to that from all ‘equivalent’ locations to yield a relative ranking of the target’s cover value.  This is interpreted directly as cover condition.  This was repeated for all locations (grid cells) and years.\r\nAn assessment of the impact of the mining industry on cover condition across the Cooper region was undertaken, using confidential well location data. \r\nSee associated publications for more details.\r\nJones, D.A., Wang, W., & Fawcett, R.

    "description": "The current distribution of Adelie penguin breeding colonies in the AAT is being mapped through a series of 'occupancy' surveys.\n\nA GIS of potential Adelie penguin breeding habitat was developed by David Smith and Angela Bender from the AADC to structure the overall search effort. Potential Adelie penguin breeding habitat was defined as islands or ice-free land close to the ocean. The GIS spanned across longitudes 36.98 to 158.82 and included 4917 sites of potential breeding habitat (see file 'Sites'). Each site of potential breeding habitat has been given an identifying code and a centroid location with an associated latitude and longitude. More information on the GIS is given in Southwell et al. (2009).\n\nThe AAT coastline was broken into groups and subgroups which were surveyed when logistics allowed. For information about the surveys see the metadata record 'Occupancy surveys of Adelie penguin breeding distribution in the Australian Antarctic Territory' with Entry ID: ASAC_2722_Occupancy_Surveys and the associated child metadata records.\n\nMaps of potential breeding habitat in the groups and subgroups were produced by Angela Bender from the GIS to use in the field surveys.\n\nThe download files include:\n1 Shapefiles created for this study: one representing islands and ice-free continental land and other with the subgroup boundaries. Notes about the development of the shapefiles are included.\n2 The maps (as pdf) of potential breeding habitat.\n3 An Excel spreadsheet detailing the names of the sites and their locations.",

Drought risk is then defined as the percentage change in farm profit between normal and drought years.\r\n\r\nPlease note there is insufficient data in the AAGIS QLD South Queensland Coastal – Curtis to Moreton and NSW Tablelands (Norther Central and Southern) therefore these regions are not displayed. \r\n",

    "description": "Data from The Great Cocky Count which takes place annually in early to mid-April. This event records birds as they fly in to night roosts on a single day and has taken place since 2010. Three species are recorded: Carnaby’s and Baudin’s (white-tailed) and Forest Red-tailed Black-Cockatoos. In the Perth-Peel Coastal Plain all white-tailed are assumed to be Carnaby’s. In other areas the roosts could include either species or both, so a generic ‘white-tailed’ term is used. Roosting sites have been buffered to I Kilometre",

    "description": "This record describes the CTD data collected on Investigator voyage IN2025_V01, titled: \"Collaborative Australian Postgraduate Sea Training Network (CAPSTAN).\" The voyage took place between March 08, 2025 and March 17, 2025 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart.\nData for 9 CTD deployments were acquired using the Sea-Bird Scientific SBE911 CTD unit #22 (serial number 1039), fitted with 36 twelve-litre bottles on the rosette sampler. Sea-Bird Scientific-supplied calibration factors were used to compute the pressures and preliminary conductivity values. CSIRO-supplied calibrations were applied to the temperature data. The data were subjected to automated QC to remove spikes and out-of-range values.\nThe following issues occurred during CTD acquisition and processing:\n• No SUNA data was recorded due to an issue with the serial port on the CTD.\n• CTD #001: the deployment log creator could not be run immediately after the deployment due to a software bug. The bug was fixed and the code updated on the master repository.\n• CTD #003 and #004 were Yo-yo deployments where no bottles were taken.\n• CTD #006: LADCP processing failed with an error. As LADCP processing is best effort, no resolution was found, and all other casts were processed with no issues.\n• CTD #007: LOPC was blocking one of the serial ports needed for Seasave, and the CTD Multicaster was also blocked. The PC was restarted which resolved the issue.\n• CTD #008 and #009: The Hydrochemistry team had issues with their equipment, therefore there are no oxygen values to calibrate.\nThe altimeter serial number and calibration date are entered incorrectly, as serial number 228403 in the .mat files (Cal Date. 26 May 2022). The correct details are shown in Table 1. This has no effect on other sensor data.\nThe final conductivity calibration was based on a single deployment grouping. The final calibration from the secondary sensor had a standard deviation (SD) of 0.001443 PSU, well within our target of ‘better than 0.002 PSU’. The standard product of 1-decibar binned averages were produced using data from the secondary sensors.\nThe dissolved oxygen data calibration fit had a SD of 0.91571μM. The agreement between the CTD and bottle data was good.\nFluorometer, PAR, transmissometer, CDOM and turbidity sensors were also installed on the auxiliary A/D channels of the CTD.\nThe collected data were processed (quality-controlled), and subsequently archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).\nAdditional information regarding this dataset may be contained in the Voyage Summary and the Data Processing Report.",

    "description": "The Australian Offshore Mineral Locations map shows mineral occurrences and deposits within Australia's 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf.\n\nAustralia will have one of the largest marine jurisdictions in the world (14.4 million square kilometres) if the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf agrees to Australia's submission on the outer limit of its extended continental shelf. This is greater than Australia's total land area (13.6 million square kilometres), including Antarctica.\n\nThe Offshore Mineral Locations map sheds light on the mineral prospectivity in this exciting, but poorly known frontier. It should serve also to ensure mineral values are considered in marine planning and decision making.\n\nThe Australian Offshore Mineral Locations map draws together data from published and unpublished marine research surveys as well as reports from federal and state government records.\n\nMineral locations shown include manganese nodules and crusts, shellsand, construction aggregate, heavy mineral sand, phosphorites, diamonds, tin, copper, gold and coal.\n\nTypes of mineralisation, some interpreted from limited information, provide an insight into the nature of the depositional settings.\n\nBathymetry shows the variable physiography of the seafloor that surrounds Australia. For the first time it is possible to identify features such as the contextual setting of manganese crusts and nodules on the East Tasman Plateau and South Tasman Rise, and shellsand and cobalt crust on the edge of the Ceduna Terrace where it descends to the South Australian Abyssal Plain.\n\nInsets and images on the map show further detail, mineral specimens and operational aspects associated with exploration and recovery of marine minerals.\n\nThe map is the result of a collaborative project between Geoscience Australia, CSIRO's Wealth from Oceans Flagship and Division of Exploration and Mining, and each of the State and Northern Territory Geological Surveys.\n\nThe Australian Offshore Mineral Locations data can be viewed online by using Geoscience Australia's Australian Marine Spatial Information System (AMSIS). AMSIS contains more than 80 layers of Australian marine information which can be viewed and integrated with mineral locations data to create maps to meet specific requirements.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "title": "Griffith Major Overland Flow Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan For CBD Catchments",
    "description": "The recommended Floodplain Risk Management Plan for the Griffith CBD catchments has been prepared in accordance with the NSW Floodplain Development Manual (Reference 6) and:\n* Is based on a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of all factors that affect and are affected by the use of flood prone land; and\n* Provides a long-term path for the future development of the community.\n\nGriffith is located approximately 450 km north of Melbourne and 560 km west of Sydney in the heart of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA). The CBD and residential areas of Griffith are located at the base of the McPherson Ranges (see Figure 1). Griffith and  its  surrounding villages of Yenda, Yoogali, Hanwood, Bilbul and Beelbangera lie within the Main Drain “J” catchment, which together with its network of drainage channels delivers runoff to Mirrool Creek.\n\nThe Griffith CBD catchment has an area of approximately 9 km2. The upper part of the  catchment is steep and covered in scattered timber and bushland. South of the bushland area the urban area begins and continues south to Wakaden St and the Temora-Roto Railway Line. This area is predominantly low density residential development.  Griffith CBD lies to the south of  the railway line, and is characterised by commercial and light industrial land uses. At the downstream extents of the CBD is the Main Canal which is raised above normal ground levels and is consequently a substantial obstruction to overland flow.\n\nThe City of Griffith is not located on the banks of a major river system and therefore does not experience mainstream flooding as occurs at other centres within the Murrumbidgee River catchment for example Wagga Wagga. However, Griffith and its surrounding areas are affected by high volume rainfall events and also from flooding from the Main Drain J system.\n\nIn the past, frequent flooding has occurred throughout the commercial areas of Griffith including Yambil Street, even in small rainfall events less than the 6 month ARI for example.  Studies have indicated that this flooding has been due to a combination of catchment runoff, blockage and/or insufficient capacity of the sub-surface drainage systems and the associated siphon drainage systems, as well as the elevated railway and canal embankments that impede downstream overland flow paths. Within the study area flows are predominantly distributed and shallow at the upstream or northern sections of the CBD catchment and runoff generally ponds behind the various embankments that tend to be aligned normal to general flow direction such as the Main Canal and railway line, before being gradually discharged through the siphon outlets located under the Main Canal at the downstream boundary of the study area. The Flood Study (Reference 1) also found that the actual flow at the siphons was largely restricted by the upstream drainage system.",

    "description": "Omega Cen is the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way. It contains at least 18 known MSPs, and there are solid hints for the presence of an even larger pulsar population. We propose a regular monthly follow-up to refine the timing solutions of the five Parkes discoveries from 2020, and to find timing solutions for the 13 MeerKAT discoveries from 2023, in combination with six MeerKAT observations between 2021 and 2023, and future MeerKAT observations. These timing solutions should enable the detection of derivatives of the spin periods of these pulsars, allowing us to probe the dynamics of Omega Cen and the presence of a possible IMBH at its centre. Timing solutions will also enable the search for X-ray and gamma-ray pulsations in the multiple sources detected in this cluster. This study will allow us to better understand the populations of this globular cluster and its formation history. We request observations until 2030, when we expect to have measurements of the second period derivative of the five brighter discoveries, and first period derivative measurements for the later discoveries. These observations will also contribute to the study of eclipsing binaries, and may include future discoveries from pending searches in MeerKAT data.",

The habitat layer provided by the LGA may vary in spatial coverage of vegetation based on the date of production and the latest imagery used to determine current vegetation presence. \nPotential clearing of vegetation based on landuse zoning is only indicative as variable outcomes of vegetation clearance based on the landuse zoning can occur.\nKoala Corridor mapping is only indicative as koalas do not traverse the landscape in a linear direction, although they will seek favoured trees.\nKoala occupancy mapping is only indicative as records rely on recording koalas in the landscape, records are driven by human activity.\nNot all areas were assessed, only areas that have the potential to be developed and therefore the potential to impact koala habitat. \nThis research has been funded by the NSW Koala Research Plan under the NSW Koala Strategy.

The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were visually undertaken by volunteers. The data covers the following Local Government Areas (LGAs):\n\n\nAlice Springs\n\n\nBoroondara\n\n\nBrimbank\n\n\nKatherine\n\n\nMelbourne\n\n\nMonash\n\n\nMoonee Valley\n\n\nMoreland\n\n\nPalmerston\n\n\nTennant Creek\n\n\nWhitehorse\n\n\nYarra\n\n\nThe 'Super Tuesday' counters collect data from intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. Bicycle Network coordinates the count at locations nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. The counts were conducted by volunteer counters who record all movements, gender of riders and their observations in fifteen minute time intervals on standardised count sheets.\nBicycle Network's 'Super Counts' programs count the volumes of bicycles and other active travellers, and their movements on roads and paths. The Super Counts program comprises two counting events: 'Super Tuesday' commuter count and the 'Super Sunday' recreation count. Super Tuesday is a two-hour count conducted during a Tuesday morning peak period in March (7-9am); Super Sunday is a four-hour count conducted during a Sunday morning-afternoon period in November (9-1pm).\nFor more information please visit Bicycle Network Bike Counts.\nBicycle counts help track progress, and identify areas of improvement to inform active transport policy with the goal of making it easier for more people to choose active modes everyday. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nAURIN has converted dates to ISO 8601 format, and have spatially enabled this dataset by creating geometries from the latitude and longitude columns with PostGIS.",

The environmental sensors, measuring light levels, humidity and temperature, have been deployed at Fitzroy Gardens and Library at the Dock. The data collected will assist the Urban Landscapes branch to better understand and communicate the impact of canopy cover for urban cooling.",

    "description": "The Larsemann Hills region is dominated by two major lithological associations, a Palaeoproterozoic felsic/mafic orthogneiss complex (S&oslash;strene Orthogneiss) which occurs as basement to a sequence of pelitic, psammitic and felsic paragneiss (supergroup = Brattstrand Paragneiss) and felsic intrusives. The depositional age of the Brattstrand Paragneiss sequences are controversial but isotopic data suggest derivation from the basement S&oslash;strene Orthogneiss. Current geochronology indicates that the region experienced medium to low pressure granulite-facies metamorphism during the Early Palaeozoic (~500 Ma). Although the paragneiss sequences record no evidence of earlier metamorphism, relicts of a previous metamorphic event at ~1000 Ma are preserved in the S&oslash;strene Orthogneiss. Within the Larsemann Hills region, the Early Palaeozoic event is characterised by peak metamorphism of ~7 kbar at ~800-850 degrees C, with the post-peak evolution characterised by decompression, with some cooling, to 4 kbars at 750 degrees C, then to 2-3 kbar at 600-650 degrees C during final stages of orogenesis, with exhumation largely driven by crustal extension. Tectonic models generally argue for a continental-continental collisional scenario, with thermal input derived from a thinned mantle lithosphere.\r\n\r\nSee the document available for download at the URL given below for further information.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Cape Spencer.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe CWI HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 190 deg true east of north (approximately south).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

A mid-voyage transfer occurred on 05 Sep, and all science personnel disembarked in Nuku’alofa on 23 Sep before the final transit to Brisbane (23 Sep–1 Oct 2025).\n\nThe Simrad EK80 split beam echosounders for 18, 38, 70 120 and 200 were used to acquire acoustic backscatter data to a range of 1500 m. All frequencies were logged mostly continuously for the extent of the voyage, with the exception of short periods of focused seabed mapping or other sampling operations. Data are stored in <em>.raw and </em>.idx format at CSIRO. There are 6540 files totalling 156 GB of raw data in this dataset.\n\nNo processing has been conducted on this data.\n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "PSR J1227-6208 is a recycled pulsar in a bianry with a massive white dwarf companion. A recent timing measurement from combined MeerKAT and Parkes observations shows the companion mass to be between 1.2 and 1.5 $M_\\odot$, very close to the Chandrasekhar, resulting in potential profound physical implications. However, the timing precision is limited by the DM timing noise. We propose regular monitoring of this pulsar with the Parkes UWL receiver in conjunction with MeerKAT observations during the following four years. The joint monitoring will significantly improve the constraints on the Post-Keplerian parameters, with Parkes observations contributing to constrain the DM noise due to its large frequency bandwidth. These observations will be added to the already existing 11-year-long timing baseline, of which the later 5 years already include high-precision MeerKAT data and Parkes UWL data.

    "description": "This dataset comprises the biomass sampling component of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80 deg C)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Tannum Sands.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.\n\nThe LEI HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 12-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km. Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 45 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 314 deg true east of north (approximately north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured. Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.\n\nThis station was decommissioned in April 2017.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Verticillium wilt model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

A Digital Surface Model was generated from the acquired imagery for the full extent of the City, enabling the stratification of vegetation into a range of height categories.

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Serrated Tussock",
    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the serrated tussock model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Alice Springs for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "As part of Geoscience Australia's Exploring for the Future Program, the Upper Darling–Baaka River Floodplain groundwater project has contributed to an improved understanding of hydrogeological systems of the Darling–Baaka River system in arid to semi-arid northwest New South Wales, a region where a lack of water security impacts communities, the environment, and limits economic opportunities. \n\nOne aspect of the project involved analysing groundwater and surface water hydrochemical data to assess aquifer characteristics, inter-aquifer and groundwater-surface water connectivity, as well as groundwater recharge and discharge dynamics. Sixty-eight groundwater and twenty-one surface or rainwater samples were collected. Selected sample suites were analysed for field parameters, major and trace ions, stable water isotopes (δ18O, δ2H, δ13CDIC), strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr), radiocarbon (14C), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), tritium (3H), chlorine isotopes (36Cl/Cl), noble gases (He, 3He/4He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), and radon (222Rn). Statistical clustering analysis of this new data and legacy datasets identified three distinct hydrochemical facies: surface water and recently recharged low salinity groundwater, saline alluvial groundwater, and groundwater associated with aquifers of the Mesozoic Great Artesian Basin. Isotope and residence time tracer signatures revealed spatial differences in recharge, groundwater-surface water connectivity, and inter-aquifer connectivity between low salinity groundwater in hydraulic connection with the Darling–Baaka River, and the saline groundwater systems that characterise most of the alluvium throughout the study area.\n\nIntegrating this hydrochemical data with other geoscientific data provided new insights into hydrogeological processes relevant to key water management issues, including controls on the distribution of low salinity groundwater.\n\nPresented at the 52nd Congress of International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH2025)",

    "description": "This data was collected in January/February 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1112V3.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania,  January 05, 2012\nArrived:  Fremantle, Western Australia,  February 12, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "title": "Australian crop report: December 2016 No. 180",
    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were already in very good condition at the end of winter. \r\n• Rainfall in September was well above average in most regions in the eastern states (including South Australia). This resulted in plentiful supplies of soil moisture being available to crops during the critical period for grain development. However, in some areas, particularly in New South Wales, the September rainfall resulted in flooding and waterlogged crops, which adversely affected grain development. \r\n• In Western Australia, spring rainfall was average to slightly below average--but timely--and aided grain development. However, severe frosts adversely affected grain development in some growing regions. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes with higher production forecast for every state. This represents a 14 per cent upward revision from the forecast ABARES published in the September 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n• For the major winter crops: wheat production is forecast to rise by 35 per cent to a record high of 32.6 million tonnes; barley production is forecast to rise by 24 per cent to a record high of 10.6 million tonnes; and canola production is forecast to rise by 22 per cent to 3.6 million tonnes, which would be the third-highest on record. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology indicated in its latest three-month rainfall outlook (December 2016 to February 2017), issued on 24 November 2016, that summer was likely to be drier and warmer than average. This should aid harvesting. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n• Australian cotton production is forecast to increase by 64 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.0 million tonnes of cotton lint and around 1.5 million tonnes of cottonseed. This forecast largely reflects increased planted area, which is estimated to have almost doubled to 520 000 hectares. \r\n• Area planted to grain sorghum is forecast to fall by 31 per cent in 2016-17 to 471 000 hectares, the lowest in 24 years. This reflects higher expected returns from growing cotton. Grain sorghum production is forecast to fall by 29 per cent to 1.4 million tonnes. \r\n• Area planted to rice is forecast to increase almost fourfold in 2016-17 to 90 000 hectares in response to an increase in the supply of irrigation water available to rice growers. However, area planted to rice is expected to be constrained by the later than usual winter crop harvest in southern New South Wales. Rice production is forecast to rise to 916 000 tonnes, an increase of more than three times on the previous season. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and smoked tobacco during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers for whom smoking status in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was 'Not stated' and mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2013 calendar year\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 987,179 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/7jq6-k9kf.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.24GB, 43.2 million rows)",

    "title": "Catchment scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017",
    "description": "This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the first national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at September 2017. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). It complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 dataset (ABARES 2017). Agricultural commodities are assigned to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8 (ABARES 2016) classes based on; perceived intervention to the landscape, growing conditions and management, the intended use of the commodity, consistency with national and international reporting frameworks and standards, such as National Plantation Inventory, industry guidelines, Australian Bureau of Statistics, harmonised trade codes and ABARES commodity reports, where possible. \r\n\r\nCommodities data were produced as part of catchment scale land use mapping and primarily uses fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field (ABARES 2011, 2015). Field validation was critical for mapping commodities. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nJurisdictions captured commodity data (where possible) for those areas most recently mapped in the Catchment scale land use of Australia - Update September 2017 (ABARES 2017) with a focus on horticultural and intensive animal industries. Other commodities which are tertiary classes of the ALUM classification (such as sugar cane, cotton, rice, olives and grapes) have been mapped by jurisdictions for some time and are included in this dataset. Agricultural commodity level mapping is available for all of the Northern Territory, and is likely to be complete for the following commodities nationally: \r\n\r\n* Crops - rice, sugar cane, cotton\r\n* Fruit - bananas (except Southern Queensland), avocados, mangoes, olives, grapes\r\n* Nuts - macadamias\r\n* Livestock - dairy cattle, pigs, poultry, horse studs, aquaculture.\r\n\r\nCommodity information is selected from an agreed list of commodity names developed by ACLUMP partners. A commodity may be applied to one or many land use codes. For example the commodity 'wheat' is applied to class 3.3.1, 'Cropping' or 4.4.1, 'Irrigated cropping', while 'cattle' may be applied to any land use where cattle are observed including 2.1.0 'Grazing native vegetation', 3.2.0 'Grazing modified pastures', 4.2.0 'Grazing irrigated modified pastures', 5.2.2 'Feedlots' etc. \r\n\r\nThe commodity description is intended to add information to the catchment scale land use map which is not otherwise recorded in the ALUM Classification. Where there are several suitable commodity descriptions mappers are encouraged to record the most detailed description. For example when cattle breeds are known to be for milk production mappers would apply the commodity description 'cattle dairy' rather than just 'cattle'.\r\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. The parent datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset is an updated version of the Galilee groundwater data October 2016.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nData from the following source datasheets within the QLD groundwater database were used: Registrations, Casing, Aquifer, Stratigraphy, Pump test and water levels. \n\nRelevant data was extracted from these source datasheets and compiled in new tab called  \"SWL Interp\".  Then the hydrostratigraphic interpretation from the original data compilation was incorporated into the \"SWL interp\" datasheet in the column called BA \"strat\". These interpretations are tagged in the \"strat interp source\" column as \"July14 SWL\" . For completeness the original interpretation is included in the datasheet called \"July14SWL\"\n\n\n\nThe focus of these updated interpretation were bores that may be screened in aquifers in the Galilee Basin. Bores that were interpreted utilising the updated data are tagged in the \"strat interp source\" column as \"Mar17 interp\". This latest version includes some minor refinements to the stratigraphic interpretation, and includes a new column (Company), which identifies if a bore forms part of a company monitoring bore network.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) Galilee groundwater data October 2016 v2.

The geocoded address provides the spatial location of the address (point) and the conventional description of a block or group of blocks in the ACT generally consisting of a street number, street name, division (urban only) and district. Addressing data is maintained on a daily basis as addresses are allocated resulting from Development Applications (DA), Estate Development Plans (EDP) or residential requests. \nEach block may have many addresses and an address may cover many blocks.  One urban block may have more than one address if there are several street frontages, or if it is a unit development or a dual occupancy.  One rural block may have more than one address for a block.  Currently, this is only the case where there is more than one residence on the block, but this may  change in the future.\nThe ACT Government maintains property street address details under the Districts Act 2002. Information is captured for both urban and rural properties.\n\nCreative Commons License Creative Common By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory),\nPlease read Data Terms and Conditions statement before data use.",

    "description": "Vicmap Address is Victoria's authoritative geocoded database of property address points.  The data includes predominately, but not exclusively, locational property address identifiers assigned by Local Government, considered to be the primary creator and custodian of property address.  If accessible, other 'real life' property addresses created and used by the community, but not recognized by Local Government including retirement villages, assisted care facilities, industrial and public housing estates etc. are included. The 2011/2012 audit against Local Government addressing revealed a 97.41% match rate, increased from 92.43% in 2008/2009 following the 2009 Address Completion Initiative. Key validation fields are 'source' and 'source_verified', respectively indicating the address source and date last validated against that source. The minimum address attributes required for a property address to be included in Vicmap Address are road name and locality. However, the principal address details include the unit/house number(s), road name (including any type or suffix) and locality (town/suburb/rural district). Vicmap Address is jointly maintained with Vicmap Property (VMPROP), with every address relating to a VMPROP  record, joined through a property_pfi link. Many additional attributes are included, where available, to facilitate use and relevance to the user community.\nN.B. Specifically excluded are non-property related, and electronic address details such as email, post office (PO) boxes, roadside delivery points (RSD's), roadside mail boxes (RMB's) and the like.\nCurrent data model: Version 6.1 (Oct 2016)",

The data will support work being done in the bay by James Cook University researchers.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "North Keeling - Orthophoto - 2011\n\nIn 2011 AAM Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Commonwealth to obtain orthophotography of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Between the 8th and 16th of August 2011 orthophotography was obtained for the entire extent of the islands (including North Keeling Island) by AAM Pty Ltd using a fixed-wing light aircraft. Previously, aerial photography was captured for Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1987 and satellite imagery in 2004. The 2011 imagery has a 15cm on ground pixel size resolution, an improvement on all previous imagery.\n\nUsing an automated process, raw images were joined to form two mosaics, one of the Cocos southern lagoon and one of North Keeling Island. Colour balancing and replacement of certain areas with alternate raw images was performed for consistency. As a guide, the orthophotography is horizontally accurate to 30cm.\n\nThe orthophotography was provided to Geoscience Australia in UTM WGS 47S. All imagery was captured using a DiMAC UltraLight 50mm Lens camera within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.4m to 1.3m. Flying height was around 800 meters with flight line spacing of around half a kilometre. The clarity and resolution is an improvement on the 2006 satellite imagery.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2018 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for macroinvertebrates in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate the scores for macroninvertebrates presented in the HWS for three scenarios:Current: habitat suitability under current conditions (i.e. 2014).Current trajectory: habitat suitability under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.Target trajectory: habitat suitability given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.Data has also been captured for a range of modelled HSM scenarios involving revegetation, stormwater management and climate change. Primary purpose is for waterways planning and analysis.Habitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. Further reading: Chee et al.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a dentist, hygienist or dental specialist in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Effective environmental impact assessment (EIA) relies on rigorous scientific assessment of all potential causal pathways by which large-scale developments may impact on valued assets in a region. Despite their importance to decision-making, many EIAs are flawed by incomplete analysis of causal pathways, limited spatial assessment and a lack of transparency about how risks have been evaluated across the region. To address these, we developed an EIA methodology based on network analysis of potential causal pathways in a given region. This network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very 21 high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the Beetaloo region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset has the input spreadsheet describing the nodes and links in the Beetaloo causal network (BEE_input.xlsx) and the spreadsheet summarizing the results of the spatial causal network analysis (BEE_output.xlsx). The dataset also contains all the grids associated with the link evaluations (grids/input) as geotiff files. The filename corresponds to the entries in the gridname column in the input spreadsheet. The dataset also contains the output grids as geotiff files. These are stored in the directory grids/outputs, organised in a directory per endpoint. Each of these directories contains: 1. a png file of the subnetwork of links leading to that endpoint, 2. the overall impact grid (geotiff), 3. a heatmap of number of processes of concern for each endpoint (geotiff) and three subdirectories (activity, stressor, process) of the impact grids of the causal pathways that contain the activity, stressor or process.",

    "title": "Parent Record: Social monogamy in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis",
    "description": "Fiddler crabs are not generally considered subjects for the study of monogamy as they tend to live in dense mixed sex colonies with numerous neighbours and individually defended territories. Here, a series of experiments have been conducted demonstrating the unique relationship between neighbouring males and females in the species Uca capricornis. These experiments illustrate that this species of fiddler crab is socially monogamous. Six experiments were conducted in relation to this investigation in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November to January in 2002-2006: \n\n1) Natural male-female interactions and territoriality - Twenty-one pairs were filmed from overhead for a period of 30 minutes. Any activity was noted, as was any interactions with intruders. Territoriality was also examined, providing the overall area covered by the crabs within the half hour. By aligning the male and female territories with their respective burrows it was possible to determine the area overlap between them. \n\n2) Sex ratio and distribution - The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The sex ratio in relation to size was determined. The location of burrows was also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\n3) Burrow tenure -To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. \n\n4) 'Neighbour' and 'stranger' relations - This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed.\n\n5) Response of paired crabs when faced with intruders of differing sex. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. \n\n6) Size-assortative mating -This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. This investigation was based upon data collected during the other experiments.",
