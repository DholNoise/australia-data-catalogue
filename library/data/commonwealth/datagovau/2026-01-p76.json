    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. New sinkhole and waterhole data for the Beetaloo GBA region, interpreted as part of GBA from remote sensing information. It includes locations and descriptions of dams, sinkholes, waterholes, circular clay filled depressions and ephemeral wetlands in the region. Waterholes and sinkholes are particularly prevalent in western Beetaloo GBA region. The sinkholes, waterholes and wetlands often appear to occur in clusters, and can be associated with depressions that can be over 1000m across. Some features may also occur adjacent to large palaeo-valleys, or in abandoned stream channels. Others seem to align with geological lineaments. Some sinkholes appear to be quite recent and contain little vegetation, whereas others are older and contain thick stands of trees.  It is likely than many of sinkholes and depressions are forms of pesudo-karst that have formed in deeply weathered regolith on the Carpentaria Basin. Where the Carpentaria Basin is thin there is potential for sinkholes and conduits to intersect with limestone karst (sinkholes and conduits) that occur in the Cambrian Limestone Aquifer.  \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nPoints were manually interpreted from remote sensing data. Underlying datasets used to help with interpretation and targeting areas of interest include: Remote sensing images for Beetaloo GBA region - regolith ratios and barest earth (Available at: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/0e84fa22-f397-489c-b99a-6492bf010613) and Digital Earth Australia Waterbodies (Available at: https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/132814).  The following columns are included in the dataset 1. Type - these are Dams, Waterholes (naturally occurring features), sinkholes, Ephemeral wetlands and depression. 2. Description - includes information on feature shape, vegetation etc., 3. Dimension, an estimate of longest dimension (in metres) 4. Name- whether the locality has a name. 5. Water - whether the feature is wet, damp or dry. 6 Source. data used to identify the feature.

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.7) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nTi Tree East site was established in July 2012 and is managed by the University of Technology Sydney. Pine Hill Station is a functioning cattle station that has been in operation for longer than 50 years. However, the east side has not been stocked in over three years. The site is a mosaic of the primary semi-arid biomes of central Australia: grassy mulga woodland and <em>Corymbia/Triodia</em> savanna.The woodland is characterised by a mulga (<em>Acacia aneura</em>) canopy, which is 4.85&nbsp;m tall on average. The soil is red sand overlying an 8&nbsp;m deep water table. Elevation of the site is 553&nbsp;m above sea level, and the terrain is flat. Mean annual precipitation at the nearby (30&nbsp;km to the south) Bureau of Meteorology station is 305.9&nbsp;mm but ranges between 100&nbsp;mm in 2009 to 750&nbsp;mm in 2010. Predominant wind directions are from the southeast and east. \n\nThe instrument mast is 10&nbsp;m tall. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon are measured using the open-path eddy covariance technique at 9.81&nbsp;m. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature and humidity (9.81&nbsp;m), windspeed and wind direction (8.28&nbsp;m), downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation (9.9&nbsp;m). Precipitation is monitored in the savanna (2.5&nbsp;m). Supplementary measurements within and below the canopy include barometric pressure (2&nbsp;m). Below ground soil measurements are made beneath Triodia, mulga and grassy understorey and include ground heat flux (0.08&nbsp;m), soil temperature (0.02&nbsp;m - 0.06&nbsp;m) and soil moisture (0 - 0.1&nbsp;m, 0.1 - 0.3&nbsp;m, 0.6 - 0.8&nbsp;m and 1.0 - 1.2&nbsp;m).",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, April 05, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, April 07, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

In most instances it includes roads and watercourses. The Planning Scheme was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the repealed Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) and the Department of Local Government and Planning guidelines and scheme template.\r\n\r\nCouncil adopted the Consolidated Planning Scheme (including all amendments to the 2004 Ipswich Planning Scheme) on 14 December 2005, and took effect (ie commencement date) on 23 January 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme divides the Ipswich Local Government Area into 8 localities-\r\n\r\nUrban Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nCity Centre\r\n\r\n\r\nRegionally Significant Business Enterprise and Industry Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nAmberley\r\n\r\n\r\nRosewood\r\n\r\n\r\nTownship Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nRural Areas, and\r\n\r\n\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach locality is further divided into Zones and in some cases, Sub Areas and Precincts. The planning scheme also provides a secondary organisational layer called Overlays, which are based on special attributes of land that need to be protected, or that may constrain development. There are two types of overlays - character places overlays and development constraints overlays.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme uses the concepts of Overall Outcomes, Specific Outcomes, Probable Solutions and Acceptable Solutions for a zone, overlay or code.\r\n\r\nOverall Outcomes are essentially the overall purpose or intent statements. Specific Outcomes are the more detailed performance objectives.\r\n\r\nProbable Solutions represent one way of achieving a specific outcome and may be either increased or decreased by the Local Government depending on the individual circumstances of the proposal.\r\n\r\nAcceptable Solutions apply only to self-assessable development and represent a precise measure for compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the zoning of a property, it is also imperative to refer to the overlay maps and associated overlay codes (see Part 11) in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development compared to the underlying zone, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nAlso, in addition to the overlays affecting a property, it is also imperative to refer to the zoning maps and associated zone codes in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nData made available under CC-BY-ND terms.\r\nData updated on changes to Scheme.",

Counts are of persons in occupied private dwellings, based on place of enumeration on census night which; includes overseas visitors; excludes Australians overseas; and excludes adjustment for under-enumeration. The data is by LGA 1991 boundaries. Periodicity: 5-Yearly. \nThis data is ABS data (cat. no. 2101.0 &amp; original geographic boundary cat. no. 1261.0.30.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The tabular data was processed and supplied to AURIN by the Australian Data Archives. The cleaned, high resolution 1991 geographic boundaries are available from data.gov.au.\nFor more information please refer to the 1991 Census Dictionary.\nPlease note:\n\n\n(a) Nature of occupancy and landlord type were not captured for caravans etc in caravan parks in previous censuses.\n\n\n(b) Comprises 'other/inadequately described' and 'not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "The Capricorn Bunker Group site is in the southern region  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park World Heritage Area (GBR).  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  This is an area where the East Australian Current (EAC) meanders as it moves south from the Swain Reefs and loses touch with the western land boundary.  The area is dynamic with warm EAC water recirculating and being wind-driven northwards along the coast inside the GBR lagoon.  The recirculating warm water contrasts with the upwelling tendency of the parts of the EAC which continue to move southwards.  The CBG radar is ideally placed to follow filaments of different water types and to investigate their impacts on coral reefs and fisheries.  \n\nApplications of the CBG radar data are in the frequency and location of regional upwelling that fuels productivity, and in the connectivity between reefs and islands.  At the central point of the CBG area of coverage is the  Heron Island Research Station which hosts many coral reef and ecology research programs.  The data will also be useful for validation of the operational Bluelink model, and the embedded higher resolution Whole-of-Reef model.   \n\nThe CBG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element receive arrays located at Tannum Sands (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) and Lady Elliot Island (-24.111 S, 152.713 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe capital funding for this system was provided originally as an ARC LEIF Grant, assisted by contributions from James Cook University, The University of Queensland, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in April 2017.",

After this time, Queensland Health moved to a quarterly reporting format for Elective Surgery and Emergency Department performance. This change was to align with the Queensland Health Hospital Performance site which supports greater consistency of other performance related activity across Hospital and Health Services.\n• Quarterly data from October 2020 can be found at https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/elective-surgery\n• There is a gap in data from March 2020 to September 2020 due to the national agreement to suspend public reporting of hospital performance.",

    "title": "Consolidated Exposures-Immediate Risk Basis",
    "description": "    \n\nIn March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs)\nbegan reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures\nto APR in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of\nthe data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\nfor its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APR ceased\nthe RFC data collection after September 2010.\n\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on\nInternational Financial Statistics (see\nhttp://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International\nbanking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the\nBIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\n\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\n\nAll banks operating in Australia complete ARF 231. Between March 2003 and\nSeptember 2010, only those larger RFCs with sizeable overseas assets and/or\nliabilities completed RRF 231. Bank and RFC positions are reported in\nAustralian dollars (AUD). Non-AUD denominated positions have been converted to\nAUD using an appropriate end-quarter exchange rate, so changes in reported\ndata between quarters are due not only to changes in positions but also\nvaluation gains or losses due to exchange rate changes.\n\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the\nrole of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international\ncapital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country\nrisk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are reported\nin this statistical table.\n\nThe data in this statistical table summarise the country exposures of\nAustralian-owned banks (and selected RFCs between March 2003 and September\n2010). This is a smaller reporting pool than the series reported in\nstatistical table B11.2, which is based on all banks and RFCs reporting\nARF/RRF 231 data. The types of assets included here are consistent with those\nreported in statistical tables B11.1, B11.2 and B12.1, except that the data\nare consolidated for Australian-owned reporting entities (i.e. includes the\nclaims on countries of all the offices worldwide of entities with head offices\nin Australia, but excludes positions between different offices of the same\ngroup). Consolidated data only include positions with non-residents (in any\ncurrency).\n\nData are shown for a selected group of countries that account for the bulk of\nthe total. Similar data for other countries are also available in statistical\ntables B13.1.1 and B13.1.2.\n\nData presented in this statistical table are immediate risk claims (expressed\nby the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis), which cover exposures on\nan immediate counterparty location basis. Ultimate risk claims are presented\nin a complementary statistical table B13.2, which cover immediate exposures\nadjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the location of\nthe ultimate counterparty/risk.\n\nIn the maturity distribution, the shortest maturity bracket includes deposits\nthat are repayable on demand, overdue items and overdrafts.\n\naInternational claimsa represent cross-border claims in all currencies and\nforeign officesa local claims in non-local currencies (which would include,\nfor example, USD claims on New Zealand residents by the New Zealand\nsubsidiary of an Australian-owned bank). Also shown are the local currency\nclaims on local residents by the foreign offices of reporting entities (for\nexample, the New Zealand dollar (NZD) claims on New Zealand residents by the\nNew Zealand subsidiary of an Australian-owned bank). These local currency\nclaims are added to international claims to produce foreign claims.\n\nInternational organisations are included in the aPublic sectora category in\nthe consolidated data (while in the locational data they can be reported as\neither bank or non-bank depending on the particular organisation). Official\nmonetary authorities (central banks or similar national and international\nbodies, such as the BIS) are also included in the public sector in the\nconsolidated data (but are treated as banks in the locational data, B12.1 and\nB12.2). Publicly-owned entities (other than banks) are classed in the aNon-\nbank private sectora in the consolidated data (and as non-banks in the\nlocational data).\n\nThe aNet risk transfera is mainly due to risk transfers into and out of\nAustralia and typically does not sum to zero. In several cases, risk is\ntransferred out of the countries listed and into Australia hence becoming, in\neffect, domestic exposures (and reducing foreign claims on an ultimate risk\nbasis). Similarly, the risk associated with what were initially domestic\nexposures has in several cases been transferred, via guarantees and other risk\ntransfers, to other countries (thereby increasing foreign claims on an\nultimate risk basis). The total risk transfer amount is not comparable to the\nrisk transfer amount reported for Australia in the data series of statistical\ntable B11.2 as the former covers only Australian-owned entities while the\nlatter is for all reporting entities.\n\nDerivatives are not included in international claims or foreign claims.\n\n",

Counts are recorded from a representative part of the wetland and the proportion sampled is recorded.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Waterbird Diversity.

The data uses 2014 Non-ABS ASGS boundaries. \nThe NRP is designed for users interested in the socio-economic and environmental characteristics of regions - and in comparisons with similar geographies across Australia. Data are arranged under the broad themes/topics of Economy, Industry, People, and Energy and Environment. \nPlease note some data are not available for all reference years, for a variety of reasons. For example; there may be conceptual breaks in a data series; the collection frequency may be irregular; some series may have revisions pending; or permission to publish in the NRP may have only been granted recently. In addition, some data series are not available for the full range of geographies. The reasons can include: data owner or custodian preferences; industry identification with a few, particular geographies only; confidentiality protection; and the presence of many suppressed data cells (at smaller geographic levels) thus making true aggregations up to larger ASGS regions difficult. \nThis data is ABS data used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Please note National Regional Profile (1379.0.55.001) has been discontinued. For the most recent regional data, please see Data By Region (1410.0). \nFor more information please visit the  Australian Bureau of Statistics.",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R0.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, October 21, 2010\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, October 27, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "In 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to obtain orthophotography of Christmas Island. The survey was carried out using a fixed wing aircraft between the 24th and 26th of August 2011. All imagery was captured using a DiMAC UltraLight 50mmm Lens camera within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from\n0.5m to 1.2m. The photo frame and tide height table lists the approximate tide height for each raw photo. Using an automated process, raw images were joined to form a mosaic of the island. Colour balancing and replacement of certain areas with alternate raw images was performed for consistency. The imagery has a 15cm on ground resolution. \n\nThe orthophotography was provided to Geoscience Australia in GDA94. It has been converted to UTM WGS 84 zone 48s using ESRI ArcMap.\n\nAAM advised that the imagery is accurate to 30cm.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

When compared to the 2010 coastline (1:30,000 data), and the 2011 orthophotography, the 2011 coastline follows the actual coast more accurately. To make the coastline, all the DEM pixels were reclassified using the ‘reclassify’ tool to give the value of zero, then the coastline was generated using the ‘raster to polygon tool’.\nNotes on other coast outlines:\nCadastre coastline: The coastline displayed as part of the cadastre is derived from the 1999 coastline, as well as some sections which have been manually surveyed.\n1999 coastline: A digital elevation model of Christmas Island was created in 1999 from which a coastline was created. This is presumed to be the basis of the 1:25,000 coastline and the original 1:30,000 coastline.\nDisclaimer",

At any given time data from all available satellites is included in the mapped and gridded data product. At times only data for TOPEX/Poseidon is available. This is indicated in one of the fields in the data file. Up to about mid-2003 the data is from TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-1/2. The next generation of satellites (Jason-1 and Envisat) take over after that. The data is on a 1/3rd degree Mercator grid - the longitude grid spacing is always 1/3rd degree. The latitude grid spacing is 1/3rd of a degree at the equator, but gets smaller with distance from the equator. This data set is in a relatively easy to use format. The data was provided by Aviso/CNES in France and has been reformatted into a netCDF file at CSIRO Marine Research in Hobart. Available on-line on the CSIRO Marine Research network; also available to outside users on request.",

The data has been calculated for each SA1 region region within the Greater Capital City regions following the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe VAMPIRE index is a research method developed at RMIT University's Centre for Urban Research (CUR) commissioned by AURIN. It assesses socio-economic oil price vulnerability in Australian cities based on an analysis of socio-economic indicators from the ABS. This technique has been successful in linking socio-economic data with an improved understanding of socio-spatial structure of vulnerability from rising transport and housing costs. Providing the VAMPIRE index in AURIN's existing data infrastructure will permit researchers and practitioners to access and evaluate VAMPIRE within their own local contexts.\nThe key (and only) dataset used to construct the VAMPIRE index is ABS census data for 2016. For each census year four Basic Community Profile (BCP) variables are used: (1) median household weekly income; (2) proportion of households owning two or more vehicles; (3) proportion of people traveling to work by car; and (4) number of homes being purchased with a mortgage.\nFor more information please view the Technical Documentation.",

    "description": "This report describes a program of simulated car crashes and examinations designed to evaluate the child restraints currently available in Australia. Each restraint was subjected to crash simulations producing deceleration forces equal to 17 times the weight of the occupant. During each crash, data such as harness forces, deceleration and velocity were recorded and high speed movies were provided. It was concluded that, in general, SAA-approved devices afforded a degree of protection adequate to ensure survival of the occupant in most real life frontal collisions; there were, however, some aspects of approved devices which could have been improved. In general, non-approved devices were considered inadequate, in at least some respects; some devices could easily be modified to satisfy safety requirements. The report concludes with detailed appraisals of 21 commercial products manufactured in Australia, Canada, Britain or the United States of America.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This resource was originally published on opengov.nsw.gov.au.

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper published through the Economics and Environment Network at The Australian National University in Canberra.\r\n*****\r\nThe failures of traditional target-species management have led many to propose an ecosystem approach to fisheries to promote sustainability. The ecosystem approach is necessary, especially to account for fishery-ecosystem interactions, but by itself is not sufficient to address two important factors contributing to unsustainable fisheries - inappropriate incentives bearing on fishers, and the ineffective governance that frequently exists in commercial, developed fisheries managed primarily by total harvest limits and input-controls. We contend that much greater emphasis must be placed on fisher motivation when managing fisheries. Using evidence from more than a dozen ?natural experiments? in commercial fisheries, we argue that incentive-based approaches that better specify community, individual harvest, or territorial rights and also price ecosystem services - coupled with public research, monitoring and effective oversight - promote sustainable fisheries.",

It includes venue classification and the allocation of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) throughout Victoria.\nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data through joining it with gaming venue locations from the VCGLR's interactive map of Victoria's gaming venues extracted on the 8th of March 2019. Therefore venues that have either changed their trading name or cease to exist as of the 8th of March 2019 will not be included in this dataset, despite being active in the year expenditure was recorded. \n\n\nEGM Numbers: Average number of operating EGM's at the gaming venue during the month. This figure is consistent with the average entitlement applied to the EGM as per tax calculation.\n\n",

The ULDO database enables the monitoring of current land development projects in addition to the identification of likely future residential, industrial and commercial land development across Perth and Peel.\nThe ULDO output covers Perth and Peel and includes:\n•   scheme amendments\n•   developer intentions\n•   structure planning in progress\n•   subdivision applications/approvals (Western Australian Planning Commission)\n•   local government development applications/approvals\n\nThe ULDO enables and supports existing planning policies by giving a spatial context to future land development over the short, medium and longer term. By identifying where future development will occur, the ULDO also supports other documents released by the WAPC. The 2016/17 release of the ULDO includes residential, special residential, special rural, industrial, commercial and tourism land uses. Within the residential land uses, the ULDO captures future fringe and infill development of five dwellings or more and single and multi-dwelling developments. \nThe ULDO seeks to provide a better understanding of the supply chain and the current status of various development initiatives to coordinate the supply and timely delivery of land to the Perth metropolitan and Peel regions.",

    "description": "The MCAS-S data pack – update 2022 supports the Multi-Criteria Analysis Shell for Spatial Decision Support (MCAS-S) software tool. \r\n\r\n*The downloadable zip file was updated 19 September 2023 to add metadata (.tip files) for Data/Primary folders Pests, Social and Soils. No data has changed.\r\n \r\nThis package of nationally consistent Australian spatial layers at one-kilometre resolution contains publicly available national data for use with MCAS-S up until December 2022. It replaces the 2014, 2011 and 2009 MCAS-S data packs. The downloadable zip file (1GB unzips to 4GB) contains a sample MCAS-S project alongside a data folder. Within the data folder are more than 290 layers in four sub-folders: Primary (raster data in GeoTIFF format for analysis) ~269 layers, Mask (raster data in GeoTIFF format for reporting and restricting the view) ~13 layers (note that categorical primary layers can now be used as masks by modifying the .tip file), Overlay (vector data in shapefile format – point, line, or polygons for context) ~17 layers, and Classified (empty folder for storage of layers created by using MCAS-S).\r\nThe layers in the Data pack are listed in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet MCAS-S-datapack2022-contents.xlsx.\r\nFor instructions to use this data pack read the descriptive metadata.\r\n\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: ABARES 2022, Multi-Criteria Analysis Shell for\r\nSpatial Decision Support MCAS-S Data pack – update 2022, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and\r\nSciences, Canberra, December 2022 CC BY 4.0.

    "title": "Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and Non-CALD Populations (2016)",
    "description": "This dataset provides a composite measure of heat vulnerability for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations in Australia, integrating three key indicators: heat exposure, heat sensibility, and heat adaptive capability. Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who are obese. Adults were classified as obese if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in BreastScreen Australia for women ages 50 to 74, by age group. The national breast cancer screening program, BreastScreen Australia began in 1991. It aims to reduce illness and death from breast cancer using screening mammography for early detection of unsuspected breast cancer in women. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic boundaries from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of women in the population aged 50-74 screened by BreastScreen Australia over 2 calendar years. The population denominator was the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 50-74 within the relevant geographical area for the relevant 2-year reporting period.\n\n\nAn SA3 was assigned to women using a postcode to SA3 correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to an SA3 and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nSA3s with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed.\n\n\nSA3 data for the Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cotter - Namadgi, Fyshwick - Piallago - Hume, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay, and Lord Howe Island were excluded due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia changed its target age group from 50-69 years to 50-74 years from July 2013; participation is reported for both the previous and current target age groups to allow comparison of trends with previously reported data.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n",

Average harvestable quantities based on Alginates (Australia) Company records (1965-72) show that cropping can expect to yield 5 ton/acre or 1.23 kg/m2. This realizes a total of 12,300 tonne available on the East Coast of Tasmania in 1986. Review of past records show fluctuations in total amounts harvested, due possibly to factors such as high oceanic water temperatures with subsequent low nutrient concentrations and storm damage.\nThe survey was conducted from a light aeroplane. Areas of Macrocystis pyrifera beds were marked on 1:100,000 topographical land tenure maps using landmarks as references. Digitising of bed outlines on maps was done using Mapinfo.\nWeight of Macrocystis per unit area is also estimated from quadrats harvested at a number of sites along the coast.",

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\n1. JP - recent– Juvenile period as years until 50% of individuals in the population have flowered \nunder recent conditions (30-year period centred on 1990) based on a model featuring the \nenvironmental variables mean annual precipitation, annual mean minimum temperature and \ngross primary productivity. (Fig 5 a in Gosper et al. 2022) \n2. JP 2× - recent–Juvenile period as 2× years until 50% of individuals in the population have \nflowered under recent conditions (30-year period centred on 1990) based on a model featuring \nthe environmental variables mean annual precipitation, annual mean minimum temperature \nand gross primary productivity.

It provides a unique opportunity for researchers and policy makers to examine pathways and transitions of population groups, such as unemployed individuals transition into the labour force. Over time, the ACLD will continue to grow as records from each new Census are linked which will further enhance its longitudinal view. The ACLD will also be augmented in the future to take account of migration and births that occur between Censuses.",

    "description": "The NSW Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey (PSDES) collects information about the main destinations of recent school leavers in the 6 to 12 months after leaving school.\nData Notes\n\n\nThe survey collected data on school leavers in the 6-12 months after leaving school in 2023, School leavers comprise students who completed Year 12 and students who left school while they were in Year 10, 11 or 12 (early school leavers).\n\n\nThere are some caveats and limitations in the generalisability of survey findings to the total population of recent school leavers in NSW. For example, students who completed Year 12 via an alternative pathway other than the HSC, such as the International Baccalaureate, are not counted as Year 12 completers and are not covered in the survey.\n\n\nPrior to 2021 a stratified sampling approach was used for the mainstream Year 12 completer survey (excluding Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and non-Connected Community school leavers). The sampling strategy for this group changed to a census for the first time in 2021 and resulted in a marked increase in the overall proportion of responses collected from the target population.\n\n\nTime series data of destinations by student type from 2014 to 2018 should be used with caution as some counts of school leavers are estimated from lower cell counts than in later years. Estimates in the data are based on base weights which are adjusted to matched population distributions for school leaver characteristics to minimise non-response bias.\n\n\nEach table shows population estimates (as column totals) for each grouping variable and leaver type combination as well as weighted percentages for each of the 10 main destination categories included in the survey. Population estimates and destination percentage breakdowns are also included for all leavers (across leaver type). Findings are reported at a system level (across leavers from government and non-government schools).\n\n\nFor a full description of notes and caveats, see the 2023 Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey Technical Report\n\n\nSee the 2023 Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey, Annual Report and fact sheets\n\n\nData Source\nNSW Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey\nAvailable tables in this dataset:\n\nTable 1 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and survey year (2014 to 2023).\nTable 2 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and gender (as self-identified) for 2023 only.\nTable 3 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and Aboriginal status (as self-identified) for 2023 only.\n",

Deaths of Australian residents that occurred outside Australia may be registered by individual Registrars, but are not included in Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) death statistics.\nStandardised death rates in this dataset differ from those in the ABS.Stat datasets and commentary. Standardised death rates in this dataset are averaged using data for the three years ending in the reference year. They are calculated for each calendar year and then averaged. Standardised death rates in the ABS.Stat datasets and commentary are based on death registration data for the reference year only. Null values represent data not available for publication\nThis dataset uses deaths and estimated resident population (ERP) for Statistical Area 2 (SA2) of Australia for 30 June 2012 to 2020, according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). ERP is final for 2012 to 2016, revised for 2017 to 2019 and preliminary for 2020, based on the 2016 Census of Population and Housing. Data has been sourced from the September 2021 release.\nFor more information including which ERP was used in this dataset please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Explanatory Notes.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data from the ABS with the 2016 SA2 boundaries.",

Generally, these features will have a width of 3 metres of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface, corners of sufficient radius to make 3-point turns by light units unnecessary.\nProposed Walking Track - Allow the safe passage of fire fighters on foot. Generally, these features will be less than 1m in width, of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface and with vegetation maintained to allow single-file walking.\nUpgraded Rigid Float - To allow the safe passage of a rigid body truck carrying a D4 or equivalent sized bulldozer or machinery. Generally, these features will have the same characteristics as tanker roads but will have smaller rollovers and no switchback corners.",

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in open-forest savanna using eddy covariance techniques. Located in a 5 square kilometre block of relatively uniform open-forest savanna, the site is representative of high rainfall, frequently burnt tropical savanna. Tropical savanna in Australia occupies 1.9 million square km across the north and given the extent of this biome, understanding biogeochemical cycles, impacts of fire on sequestration, vegetation and fauna is a national priority. In the NT, savanna ecosystems are largely intact in terms of tree cover, with only modest levels of land use change. Despite this, there is evidence of a loss of biodiversity, most likely due to shifts in fire regimes and a loss of patchiness in the landscape. Approximately 40% of the savanna burn every year and understanding fire impacts on fauna and flora is essential for effective land management.

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) indicators by activity node locations for the year of 2021.\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity) \n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility. \nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Route Segment (Polyline) 2021\".\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website. A full list of SNAMUTS publications can be found at http://www.snamuts.com/publications.html.",

    "description": "This dataset was created for the independent Commonwealth Marine Reserves Review and does not reflect government policy.\n\nIn November 2012, the Australian Government established 44 new Commonwealth marine reserves (CMRs) in the South-west, North-west, North, Temperate East and Coral Sea marine regions, as part of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). These reserves build on previous MPAs, including those in the South-east CMR Network declared in 2007, to form Australia’s system of Commonwealth marine reserves.\n\nAn independent review of the CMRs proclaimed in 2012 was undertaken between September 2014 and December 2015, with a view to informing statutory management plans for the CMRs. \n \nThis dataset contains spatial and contextual advice for zoning boundaries as recommended by the Bioregional Advisory Panel for the Commonwealth Marine Reserves Review. The dataset does not reflect Australian Government policy. It does not include data on MPAs in other Australian jurisdictions (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, State/Territory parks), or terrestrial protected areas with marine components (e.g. Pulu Keeling National Park), nor does it include the South-east CMR Network which was not included in the Commonwealth Marine Reserves Review.

    "description": "Speed Signs is a spatial dataset (point) that shows the location of every Speed Limit sign across Victoria including advisory 'Speed Limit Ahead' signs. The data includes attributes such as Road Name, Sign Size, Type, Speed Value, Bearing and Direction.\nVariable speed signs display the alternative speed limit during the times that limit is active. This is captured in the variable time and day fields in the dataset. A standard ('static') speed sign with the prevailing speed limit is provided at the end of the zone which serves to end the variable zone, or act as a reminder sign for times when the variable speed limit isn't active.\nData Quality\nWhilst every effort has been made to ensure this information is up-to-date, there may be instances where signs are not yet recorded in this system.\nDisclaimer\nNo claim is made as to the accuracy or currency of the content on this site at any time.
