Applications of these data include solar energy, agriculture, building thermal design and water balance modelling. Climatologies are given for two radiation parameters: the global horizontal exposure, which is the total amount of solar energy falling on a horizontal surface over a time interval; and the direct normal exposure which is the total of the component of radiation from the sun’s disk on a plane perpendicular to the beam. Climatologies of daily exposure are given as an annual average and as a set of twelve monthly averages. Climatologies of the diurnal cycle are given as monthly averages of hourly exposures through the day. These data sets are derived from 23 years (1990 - 2012) of data from satellites operated by Japan Meteorological Agency and the US National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric Administration. NEII",

The dataset includes information in the following specified areas regarding persons born overseas: Overseas Born Population, Year of Arrival in Australia, Australian Citizenship, Religious Affiliation, English Proficiency, Non-School Qualifications, Occupation of Employed Persons, Labour Force and Total Personal Income (Weekly).\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data with the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) LGA 2019 dataset.\n\n\nSome data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.\n\n\nWhere data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.\n\n\nColumns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.\n\n",

    "title": "Consolidated Exposures – Ultimate Risk Basis",
    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nAll banks operating in Australia complete ARF 231. Between March 2003 and September 2010, only those larger RFCs with sizeable overseas assets and/or liabilities completed RRF 231. Bank and RFC positions are reported in Australian dollars (AUD). Non-AUD denominated positions have been converted to AUD using an appropriate end-quarter exchange rate, so changes in reported data between quarters are due not only to changes in positions but also valuation gains or losses due to exchange rate changes.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are reported in this statistical table.\r\n\r\nThe data in this statistical table summarise the country exposures of Australian-owned banks (and selected RFCs between March 2003 and September 2010). This is a smaller reporting pool than in the series reported in statistical table B11.2, which is based on all banks and RFCs reporting ARF/RRF 231 data. The types of assets included here are consistent with those reported in statistical tables B11.1, B11.2 and B12.1, except that the data are consolidated for Australian-owned reporting entities (i.e. includes the claims on countries of all the offices worldwide of entities with head offices in Australia, but excludes positions between different offices of the same group). Consolidated data only include positions with non-residents (in any currency).\r\n\r\nData are shown for a selected group of countries that account for the bulk of the total. Similar data for other countries are also available in statistical table B13.2.1.\r\n\r\nData presented in this statistical table are ultimate risk claims. Ultimate risk claims cover claims on an immediate counterparty location basis that have been adjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the location of the ultimate counterparty/risk. Data on immediate risk claims (expressed by the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis) are available in complementary statistical tables B13.1 and B13.1.2.\r\n\r\nForeign claims refers to all cross-border claims plus foreign offices’ local claims on residents in both local and foreign currencies. It is equal to the addition of local currency claims of reporting entities’ foreign offices on local residents, and international claims. Data for all these accounts on an immediate risk basis are available in a complementary statistical table B13.1.\r\n\r\nInternational organisations are included in the ‘Public sector’ category in the consolidated data (while in the locational data they can be reported as either bank or non-bank depending on the particular organisation). Official monetary authorities (central banks or similar national and international bodies, such as the BIS) are also included in the public sector in the consolidated data (but are treated as banks in the locational data, B12.1 and B12.2). Publicly-owned entities (other than banks) are classed in the ‘Non-bank private sector’ in the consolidated data (and as non-banks in the locational data).\r\n\r\n‘Cross border’ positions are those positions with bank and non-bank counterparties located in a country other than the country of residence of the reporting entity (or its affiliate). This would include, for example, lending by a bank in Australia to a company in France; it would also include loans by that bank’s subsidiary in the UK to a company in France.\r\n\r\n‘Local’ claims are those claims of overseas affiliates of the reporting entity on the residents of the countries in which they are located. These are largely in local currencies but include non-local currencies as well.\r\n\r\nDerivatives are not included in foreign claims. On- and off-balance sheet derivatives are shown separately as a memo item. ‘Derivatives’ are those on- and off-balance sheet derivative exposures (to the country of ultimate risk) that are in a positive market value position. Negative market values of derivative contracts represent financial liabilities and are therefore excluded from the reporting of financial claims. The data mainly comprise forwards, swaps and options relating to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity and credit derivative contracts. Credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps and total return swaps, are included in ‘Derivatives’ if they belong to the trading book of a protection-buying reporting entity. Credit derivatives that belong to the banking book are reported as risk transfers by the protection buyer. All credit derivatives are reported as guarantees by the protection seller.\r\n\r\n‘Guarantees’ refers to contingent liabilities arising from an irrevocable obligation to pay to a third-party beneficiary when a client fails to perform some contractual obligations. They include: secured, bid and performance bonds; warranties and indemnities; confirmed documentary credits; irrevocable and stand-by letters of credit; acceptances; and endorsements. Guarantees also include the contingent liabilities of the protection seller of credit derivative contracts.\r\n\r\n‘Credit commitments’ covers arrangements that irrevocably obligate an institution, at a client’s request, to extend credit in the form of: loans; participation in loans, lease financing receivables, mortgages, overdrafts or other loan substitutes; or commitments to extend credit in the form of the purchase of loans, securities, or other assets (e.g. back-up facilities including those under note issuance and revolving underwriting facilities).\r\n",

    "title": "Assessment of Swamp Oak Floodplain Forest TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate (South Coast Region)",
    "description": "The operational map for Swamp Oak Floodplain Forest (SOFF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast. \nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for SOFF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that SOFF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of SOFF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas.\nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain SOFF. We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of SOFF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the SOFF determination.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to SOFF based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and model output underlying each API polygon. \nIn total, we mapped approximately 272 hectares of SOFF across our full study area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "Remnant vegetation mapping for the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion, Metropolitan and Peel Region Scheme areas in 2024. Part of a suite of polygon datasets that best represent remnants of original pre-1750 vegetation across the mapped areas as at 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2024. The polygons represent interpreted areas of vegetation using current and historical digital aerial photography (1953-present) sourced from State Government repositories and other commercial products e.g. Digital globe, ESRI wayback imagery and Google. Simplified condition of the vegetation has been attributed to some polygons. \n\nThe mapped area covers the Metropolitan and Peel Region Schemes, the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion as defined in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia V 7.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2025) and the Swan Coastal Plain vegetation complexes (DBCA-046) (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2016). \n\nFor further information refer to Explanatory Report titled 'Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel remnant native vegetation extent mapping in 2000-2020 (5 yearly interval) and the year 2024.pdf'",

    "description": "In 2005 Geoscience Australia and the National Oceans Office undertook a joint project to produce a consistent, high-quality 9 arc second (0.0025 decimal degree (dd) or ~250m at the equator) bathymetric grid for Australian waters. In 2009 a number of new datasets were included in an updated version of the grid.\n, The 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia was produced to include recently acquired datasets, and solutions to issues identified in the previous version. The revised grid has the same extents as its 2005 counterpart, including the Australian water column jurisdiction lying between 92o E and 172o E, and 8o S and 60o S. The waters adjacent to the continent of Australia and Tasmania are included, as are areas surrounding Macquarie Island, and the Australian Territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The area selected does not include Australia's marine jurisdiction offshore from the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory.\n, As per the 2005 grid, the 0.0025 dd resolution is only supported where direct bathymetric observations are sufficiently dense (e.g. where swath bathymetry data or digitised chart data exist) (Webster and Petkovic, 2005). In areas where no sounding data are available (in waters off the Australian shelf), the grid is based on the 2 arc minute ETOPO (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) and 1 arc minute ETOPO (Amante and Eakins, 2008) satellite derived bathymetry. The topographic data (on shore data) is based on the revised Australian 0.0025dd topography grid (Geoscience Australia, 2008), the 0.0025dd New Zealand topography grid (Geographx, 2008) and the 90m SRTM DEM (Jarvis et al, 2008).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nBoth the floodway and flood fringe make up the 1 in 100 (1%) annual exceedance probability (AEP) floodplain, however there are areas where the floodplain exists, but the floodway and flood fringe does not. In such situations, a different floodplain management strategy applies (for example, the Swan River between the Narrows and Canning Bridges).\n\nThis dataset contains four lines - Floodway limit, Extent of 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flooding, Extent of floodway &amp; Extent of study. \n\nThe Floodway limit, Extent of floodway and Extent of 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Flooding and Extent of study line types are boundaries which appropriately overlay over the \"FPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Areas\" (polygon) dataset. \n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River – Toodyay, Northam, York and Beverley Townsites. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nBlackwood River – Augusta, Bridgetown, Nannup and Boyup Brook Townsites.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nBrunswick River - Greater Bunbury \n</li>\n<li>\n\nCoblinine River &amp; Dorderyemunning Creek - Wagin Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nChapman River – Geraldton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDenmark River – Denmark Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGascoyne River - Carnarvon Townsite and the Lower Gascoyne.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGribble Creek - Kalgoorlie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHarding River - Roebourne Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nIrwin River - Dongara Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLower Collie River - Greater Bunbury.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Donnybrook Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSerpentine River, Peel, Birrega &amp; Oaklands Drains, Murray River and the Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary - Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Pinjarra and south to the Darling Scarp (Murray River) and Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Wellard (Peel Main Drain), east to South Western Highway (Serpentine River) and north to Wungong Brook (Birrega Drain).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Perth - Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River). Tributaries include Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Ellen Brook, Helena River, Henley Brook, Jane Brook, St Leonards Creek, Susannah Brook (Swan River) and Southern River/ Wungong Brook (Canning River).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nToby Inlet – Quindalup Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nVasse-Wonnerup Estuaries, Broadwater and New River - Busselton Townsite.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor further information on flooding and floodplain management in Western Australia, please refer to our Water Facts publications: Flooding in Western Australia (Water facts 13) and Floodplain Management (Water facts 14).\n\nThis information is available at the following addresses:\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-13-Flooding-in-Western-Australia.pdf\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFlood fringe - the area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway where development could be permitted provided it is compatible with flood hazard and building conditions provide an adequate level of flood protection. These areas are generally covered by still or very slowly moving waters during a 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodway - the river channel and a portion of the floodplain where a significant flow or storage of water occurs during floods. If the floodway is even partially blocked, then the natural flooding regime of the area may be detrimentally impacted with flood levels being raised and affecting areas which may not have been previously affected. Development in floodways is to be avoided wherever possible.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "The study focussed on the estuarine portion of the Swan-Canning River system, WA using the black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), an estuarine dependent fish species, as a biomonitoring tool.  Prior to the commencement of this study it had been determined that the black bream was a suitable fish species for use as a biomonitoring tool when using mixed function oxygenase (MFO) activity induction under laboratory conditions. Biopsies taken from feral black bream collected from eight sites during the period 2000 to 2002 from the estuary confirmed that the use of MFO induction in this fish species as a biomarker of exposure to organic contaminants is a reliable biomarker.",

Having defined preferred and non-preferred terms within sport is intended to promote consistency in terminology across the entire sporting community. While at this stage it is called a Thesaurus, in the longer term it is hoped that the product becomes a sports metadata register for the purpose of creating data standards for data exchange and interoperability. \r\n\r\nThe _Australian Sports Thesaurus_ seeks to provide clarity and assistance to the sport community by:\r\n1. ensuring consistency of understanding and usage of sport terminology in documentary, legal and commercial discussions\r\n2. enabling improved system and database interoperability and reporting \r\n3. facilitating search and retrieval of information from sport information systems \r\n4. facilitating the defining of sport data for Data Dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThe terms and definitions are where relevant linked by the following relationships:\r\n+Preferred term\r\n+Non-preferred term\r\n+Broader term\r\n+Narrower term\r\n+Related term\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in tropical woodland using eddy covariance techniques. The site was situated within a wetland that flooded seasonally. The principle vegetation was <em>Oryza rufipogon</em>, <em>Pseudoraphis spinescens</em> and <em>Eleocharis dulcis</em>. The elevation was approximately 4m, with a neighbouring Bureau of Meteorology station recording 1411mm mean annual precipitation.Maximum temperatures ranged from 31.3°C (in June and July) to 35.6°C (in October), while minimum temperatures ranged from 14.9°C (in July) to 23.9°C (in December and February). Maximum temperatures varied on a seasonal basis by approximately 4.3°C and minimum temperatures by 9.0°C.  The instrument mast was 15m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation were measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes were measured and soil moisture content was gathered using time domain reflectometry. Ancillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, N and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the transect in September 2008. This data is also available at http://data.ozflux.org.au .",

    "title": "Catchment Scale Land Use Mapping for Western Australia 2018 (DPIRD-067)",
    "description": "This vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale.\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia.\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use.\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use.\nThis update refreshes the entire state of Western Australia to ALUM v8.",

    "description": "This data is Statistical Local Areas (SLA) based Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) - Is a continuum of advantage to disadvantage. Low values indicate areas of disadvantage; and high values indicate areas of advantage. This data is based on the 2006 census and follows the 2006 Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) boundaries.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has developed indexes to allow ranking of regions/areas, providing a method of determining the level of social and economic wellbeing in that region. There are four indexes included in the SEIFA 2006 product. They relate to socio-economic aspects of geographic areas. Each index summarises a different aspect of the socio-economic conditions in an area. The indexes have been obtained by a technique called principal components analysis. This technique summarises the information from a variety of social and economic variables, calculating weights that will give the best summary for the underlying variables. For the SEIFA indexes, each index uses a different set of underlying variables.\nAll the indexes (including the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage) have been constructed so that relatively disadvantaged areas (e.g. areas with many low income earners) have low index values.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 2033.0.55.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \nFor more information on this data please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Please note: \n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data following the 2006 ASGC.\n",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "A total of thirteen rotary cored bores were sunk by the Bureau approximately one mile south of the village of Teralba in the Parishes of Teralba and Awaba, Northumberland County. The Great Northern Seam in places is sufficiently thick for open cut mining but the coal is generally of very poor quality and the overburden to coal ratio much too high to warrant further drilling. Continued prospecting of the Fassifern Seam in this area is not warranted, because of the very poor quality of the coal in this seam. This report contains an account of the operations, and describes the results of the geological investigations. The results of drilling are detailed in the accompanying plates and bore logs.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

In taking a longitudinal view of Australians, the ACLD may uncover new insights into the dynamics and transitions that drive social and economic change over time, conveying how these vary for diverse population groups and geographies. It is envisaged that the 2016 and successive Censuses will be added in the future, as well as administrative data sets. The ACLD is released in ABS TableBuilder and as a microdata product in the ABS Data Laboratory. \r\n\r\n The Census of Population and Housing is conducted every five years and aims to measure accurately the number of people and dwellings in Australia on Census Night. \r\n\r\n Microdata products are the most detailed information available from a Census or survey and are generally the responses to individual questions on the questionnaire. They also include derived data from answers to two or more questions and are released with the approval of the Australian Statistician.\r\nThe following microdata products are available for this longitudinal dataset: \r\n•ACLD in TableBuilder - an online tool for creating tables and graphs. \r\n•ACLD in ABS Data Laboratory (ABSDL) - for in-depth analysis using a range of statistical software packages.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU sugar industry, EU almond industry and investment on Australia's farms. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 3.3 per cent to around $58.4 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 3.8 per cent increase to $56.5 billion in 2015-16. If realised, the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 13 per cent higher than the five-year average of $51.8 billion between 2011-12 and 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to remain largely unchanged at $29.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 6.6 per cent to $29.2 billion in 2016-17. This mainly reflects forecast increases in the gross values of horticulture, cotton and oilseed production offsetting forecast decreases in the gross values of wheat and barley production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to fall slightly to $44 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.3 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.5 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to fall in 2016-17 are beef and veal (-12 per cent), dairy products (-1 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (-4 per cent), chickpeas (-32 per cent) and mutton (-17 per cent). Export earnings for wheat are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• The forecast decreases in 2016-17 are expected to be partly offset by forecast rises in export earnings for wool (6 per cent), sugar (21 per cent), wine (1 per cent), cotton (40 per cent), lamb (3 per cent) and canola (43 per cent). \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 8 per cent to $1.7 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.8 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia averaged 2.9 per cent in 2015-16 and is assumed to average 2.7 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2016-17, largely unchanged from the estimated average for 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU sugar industry  \r\n• The EU sugar market is highly regulated, with domestic price support, export subsidies and import restrictions. This stocktake of EU domestic and trade policies that support the EU sugar market will inform government and industry in the lead up to the commencement of Australia-EU FTA negotiations. \r\n• Australia's access to the EU sugar market is constrained by a country-specific tariff rate quota. Any improved access through either lower tariffs or increased quota would improve Australia's competitiveness in that market. \r\n\r\n The EU almond industry  \r\n• The European Union is the world's largest consumer and importer of almonds and has been a growing export market for Australian almonds since 2005-06. \r\n• However, significant benefits from an Australian-EU FTA are unlikely for Australian almonds because import tariffs are already low and equal to those faced by the United States, the main supplier to this market. \r\n\r\n Investment in Australian farms  \r\n• Investment in Australian farms is substantial, with net additions of non-land capital items on broadacre and dairy farms currently worth around $2 billion a year. \r\n• Farm operators and their spouses provide most of the capital used to fund the ownership and operation of Australian farms; corporate investors account for less than one-fifth of total capital. The strength of the family farm business structure suggests that corporate investors are unlikely to significantly displace family farmers in the near future. \r\n",

    "description": "## This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at March 2014. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (1997 to 2012) and scale of mapping (1:25 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 7, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. ",

In the course of the magnetic work in Brown's area, a major magnetic anomaly was discovered south-west of the workings, and a reconnaissance magnetic survey was carried out in order to obtain information on its extent.

    "description": "This dataset contains probability of seabed hardness data (multibeam angular backscatter response derived product) from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11)\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R2.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart, Australia, January 10, 2013\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January 15, 2013\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This web service (WFS/WMS) contains sediment and geochemistry data for the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in the Timor Sea collected by Geoscience Australia during September and October 2012 on RV Solander (survey GA0339/SOL5650).  The detailed metadata for the individual sediment and geochemistry layers are in the following GeoCAT records: 78786, 78788, 78789, 78790, 78791, 78793, 78794, 78795, 78796, 78798 and 79005. Further information on the survey is available in the post-survey report published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L., Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A. 2013. Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (Timor Sea) Biodiversity Survey: GA0339/SOL5650 Post Survey Report. Record 2013/38. Geoscience Australia: Canberra. (GEOCAT #76658).\nSurvey SOL5650/GA0339 was undertaken between 12 September and 6 October 2012, using the AIMS 35 m research vessel Solander with a science and technical support crew from AIMS, Geoscience Australia, University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. The survey comprised a series of geophysical mapping and biophysical sampling activities in four areas within the Oceanic Shoals CMR. In each survey area, multibeam sonar data (bathymetry and backscatter) was collected to provide 100% spatial coverage, with sampling stations selected before the survey. Site selection used a spatially-balanced random stratified method (termed a Generalised Random-Tessellation Stratified [GRTS] design), that was weighted to shallow areas (<50 m water depth). Sampling included non-destructive techniques (towed underwater video, stills photography, baited underwater video) to record benthic and pelagic biota, plus physical sampling of sediments and epibenthic biota (grabs, benthic sled tows). Water column measurements (conductivity, temperature, turbidity) and sea surface samples were also taken at representative stations and during transits. To broadly characterise the sub-surface geology, shallow (<70 m) sub-surface data was collected across three of the survey areas with a sub-bottom profiler.\nSampling was undertaken at 70 stations across the four survey areas to characterise the geophysical and biological properties of the seabed and water column within each area; with sea surface samples collected at a further nine stations during transits. At each station, the type of sampling undertaken and the gear used was determined by the seabed composition, water depth and visibility. In particular, deployment of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) was limited to water depths less than ~60 m due to high turbidity and low light conditions. \nSampling activities within the four survey areas included:\nTowed underwater video transects at 52 stations to characterise seabed types and benthic communities;\nCollection of replicate sediment samples at 61 stations for sedimentology, geochemistry and infauna analyses using either a Smith-McIntyre grab (29 stations) or a box corer (32 stations);\nBenthic sled tows at 22 stations to sample epibenthos;\nDeployment of BRUVS at 56 stations to characterise demersal fish communities;\nDeployment of Stereo Imagery System for Shark and Tuna Assessments (SISSTAs) units at 120 stations to characterise pelagic fish communities;\nDeployment of a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) instrument at 63 stations to characterise water column properties, and; \nDeployment of 10 ocean drifters to map surface ocean currents in the region.\nA link to the post-survey report is available here: http://www.ga.gov.u/corporate_data/76658/Rec2013_038.pdf\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nSurface expression GDEs are ecosystems that are dependent on the discharge of groundwater on a permanent or intermittent basis to meet all or some of their water requirements so as to maintain their communities of plants and animals, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Surface expression GDE areafeatures include wetlands and regional ecosystems that have some surface groundwater dependency. This dataset is one of five datasets that describe the distribution of known and potential GDEs across the landscape. The complete set of GDE datasets is listed below. Information about the location and extent of known and potential GDEs was sourced from expert knowledge, literature and existing datasets. 1. Surface expression GDE points 2. Surface expression GDE lines 3. Surface expression GDE areas 4. Terrestrial GDE areas 5. Subterranean GDE areas As the different types of GDEs represent different overlapping layers or cross-sections of the landscape, it is recommended that the datasets be mapped in the order of listing shown above (i.e. surface expression GDE points on top) to maintain logical consistency and assist visualisation.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThere are five datasets that describe the distribution of known and potential GDEs across the landscape: 1. Surface expression GDE points, 2. Surface expression GDE lines, 3. Surface expression GDE areas, 4. Terrestrial GDE areas, 5. Subterranean GDE areas.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nLinework to delineate the GDE extent was sourced from the following datasets (held by the Queensland Herbarium, Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts): 1. Queensland Wetland Data Wetlands Mapping (2009 extent, Version 3.0) 2. Vegetation Communities and Regional Ecosystems (REs) of Queensland (2009 extent, Version 7.0) Although the wetlands linework was typically used to represent surface expression GDEs and regional ecosystems linework typically used to represent terrestrial GDEs, this was not always the case. A notable exception is the inclusion of riverine regional ecosystems as potential terrestrial GDEs. Non-wetland regional ecosystems have been used to delineate areas that may potentially contain surface expression GDEs such as geological contact zones where springs may be not detected as a wetland in current wetlands mapping due to their small size. ATTRIBUTION The attribution for this dataset was sourced from expert knowledge, literature and existing spatial datasets. Information about the location and extent of groundwater was collected at GDE workshops held for the eastern Murray-Darling Basin and Wide Bay and Burnett mapping areas. Information collected from regional staff and other experts with local knowledge of groundwater included the location of wetlands, springs and stream baseflow. Known and potential GDEs were identified in the GDE workshops and this is attributed in the data with the level of confidence (i.e. high, moderate or low) in the knowledge about the GDE. The degree of groundwater dependency is not described. An important part of the information collection at the GDE workshops included the capture of pictorial conceptual models which are representations of observed objects, phenomena and processes in a logical and objective way with the aim of constructing a formal system whose theoretical consequences are not contrary to what is observed in the real world. These pictorial conceptual models will be hyperlinked to the GDE spatial data to aid the interpretation of the data. For more information refer to the GDE pictorial conceptual models. Another key part of the information collected was the identification of GDE decision rules that described combinations of conditions where ecosystems are or are likely to be dependent on groundwater at a specific site or local area according to expert knowledge. GDE decision rules may include descriptions of conditions such as geology, vegetation, topographic position, elevation and rainfall zones. These decision rules were subsequently categorised and combined into GDE mapping rule-sets in preparation for their application using geographic information system (GIS) technology. GDE mapping rule-set is a combination of related decision rules with similar groundwater dependent ecosystem drivers and processes that when applied to spatial data sets through GIS analysis delineate where ecosystems are or are likely to be dependent on groundwater. These GDE mapping rule-sets are used to determine the 'derived' potential GDEs that make up the majority of the GDE mapping. A full list of GDE mapping rule-sets developed for the eastern MDB and WBB regions is described below. Note that where the GDE mapping rule-sets are used, this may result in the identification of surface expression GDEs and/or terrestrial GDEs according to the local conditions and landscape drivers.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\n\"Queensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts\" (2013) Queensland groundwater dependent ecosystems.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with specialist and obstetric costs, and out-of-pocket cost per specialist and obstetric attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nSpecialist attendances are Medicare-subsidised referred patient/doctor encounters, such as visits, consultations, and attendances by video conference, involving medical practitioners who have been recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for Medicare benefits purposes.\n\n\nObstetric attendances are Medicare-subsidised antenatal visits and attendances for the planning and management of pregnancy, as well as obstetric procedures involving non-admitted patients. These services can be provided by an obstetrician or GP. Selected services can also be provided by a midwife, nurse or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioner when the service is provided on behalf of, and under the supervision of, a medical practitioner.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.

    "title": "Reef Rescue Marine Monitoring Program - Pesticide monitoring in inshore waters of the Great Barrier Reef using both time-integrated and event monitoring techniques 2005 - 2008 (RRMMP, Entox UQ)",
    "description": "The aim of this component of the Reef Rescue Monitoring Program is to assess trends in the concentrations of specific herbicides and pesticides, primarily through routine monitoring at sites (Green Island, Low Isles, Fitzroy Island, Normanby Island, Dunk Island, Orpheus Island, Magnetic Island, Cape Cleveland, Pioneer Bay, Outer Whitsunday, Sarina Inlet, North Keppel Island) within 20km of the Queensland coast. The monitoring year for routine pesticide sampling is from May to April. The year is arbitrarily divided into ¿Dry Season¿ (May to October) and ¿Wet Season¿ (November¿ April) sampling periods for reporting purposes. Within each dry season, samplers are typically deployed for two months (maximum of three monitoring periods) and within each wet season, samplers are typically deployed for one month (maximum of six monitoring periods). The maximum number of samples which should be obtained from each location within each monitoring year is nine.\r\n\r\nExposure to chemicals in the water is assessed with passive samplers. Passive samplers accumulate organic chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides from water until equilibrium is established between the concentration in water (CW ng.L-1) and the concentration in the sampler (CS ng.g-1). The concentration of the chemical in the water is estimated from calibration data obtained under controlled laboratory conditions (Booij et al., 2007). This calibration data consists of either sampling rates (RS L.day-1) for chemicals which are expected to be in the time-integrated sampling phase or sampler-water equilibrium partition coefficients (KSW L.g-1) for chemicals which are expected to be in the equilibrium sampling phase. \r\nDifferent types of organic chemicals need to be targeted using different passive sampling phases. The passive sampling techniques which are utilized in the MMP include: \r\n\r\nSDB-RPS Empore¿ Disk (ED) based passive samplers for relatively hydrophilic organic chemicals with relatively low octanol-water partition coefficients (logKOW) such as the Photosystem II (PSII) herbicides (example: diuron).\r\n\r\nPolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Semipermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) passive samplers for organic chemicals which are relatively more hydrophobic (higher log KOW) such as chlorpyrifos. \r\n\r\nThe list of target chemicals was determined based on the following criteria: pesticides detected in recent studies, those recognised as a potential risk, analytical affordability, pesticides within the current analytical capabilities of Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services (QHFSS) and those likely to be accumulated within one of the passive sampling techniques (i.e. that exist as neutral species and are not too polar).\r\n\r\nTarget Chemicals\r\nBifenthrin, \r\nFenvalerate (Pyrethroid, insecticides), \r\nBromacilb , \r\nTebuthiuron, \r\nTerbutrync,\r\nFlumeturon,\r\nAmetryn, \r\nPrometryn, \r\nAtrazine,\r\nPropazine, \r\nSimazine, \r\nHexazinone, \r\nDiuron (PSII herbicides), \r\nDesethylatrazine, \r\nDesisopropylatrazine (PSII herbicide breakdown products (also active)), \r\nOxadiazon Oxadiazolone (herbicide),\r\nChlorfenvinphos , \r\nChlorpyrifos, \r\nDiazinon, \r\nFenamiphos, \r\nProthiophos (Organophosphate insecticide), \r\nChlordane, \r\nDDT, \r\nDieldrin , \r\nEndosulphan, \r\nHeptachlor, \r\nLindane (Organochlorine insecticides), \r\nHexachlorobenzene (Organochlorine fungicide), \r\nImidacloprid (Nicotinoid insecticide), \r\nTrifluralin (Dintiroaniline), \r\nPendimethalin (Dinitroaniline herbicide), \r\nPropiconazole, \r\nTebuconazole, (Conazole fungicides)\r\nMetolachlor (Chloracetanilide herbicide)\r\nPropoxur (Carbamate insecticide)\r\n\r\nPSII herbicides (ametryn, atrazine, diuron, hexazinone, flumeturon, prometryn, simazine and tebuthiuron and atrazine transformation products desethyl- and desiso-propyl ¿ atrazine) sampled by the SDB-RPS ED samplers are also expressed as PSII herbicide equivalent concentrations (PSII-HEq) and are assessed against a PSII-HEq Index (Kennedy et al. 2010) for reporting purposes.  PSII-HEq values were derived using relative potency factors (REP) collated from relevant laboratory studies for each chemical with respect to a reference PSII herbicide diuron (Jones and Kerswell, 2003; Mueller et al. 2008; Bengston-Nash et al 2005; Schmidt, 2005; Macova et al unpublished). \r\n\r\nIf a given PSII herbicide is as potent as diuron, it will have a REP of 1. If it is more potent than diuron it will have a REP of >1, while if it is less potent than diuron it will have an REP of <1.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Location:\r\n\r\nThis dataset is saved in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\RRMMP\\UQ_Mueller_Inshore-pesticides\\GBR_RRMMP_UQ_Inshore-pesticides-2011",
