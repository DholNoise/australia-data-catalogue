These include: Almanac listings, Colonial Secretary's Office Records, Police Gazettes, various police department occurrence books and letter books, police journals, government gazettes, estimates, York police records etc.\r\n\r\nEntry is by name of policeman. Information given varies but is usually about appointments, promotions, retirements, transfers etc.\r\n\r\nThe Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia. A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.\r\n\r\nThe dataset contains: several csv files with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.\r\n\r\nThe transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including:\r\n\r\n* Some cards are missing\r\n* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information\r\n* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not\r\n* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card\r\n* As the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.\r\nIt is still a very valuable dataset as it contains a wealth of information about early settlers in Western Australia. It is of particular interest to genealogists and historians.",

    "description": "With this proposal we ask time to continue our timing follow-up campaign of pulsars discovered with the MeerKAT telescope. Fourtytwo sources have been discovered in targeted observations of Fermi unidentified point sources, two towards Supernova Remnants, 19 in the Magellanic Clouds, 105 in Globular Clusters and 81 in a survey of the Galactic plane. A large fraction of the new discoveries are recycled pulsars (including a few relativistic systems and several 'spider' binaries), or young pulsars. Timing observations have an essential role in exploiting the full potential of any pulsar discovery, allowing for the precise measurement of rotational, astrometric and orbital parameters which, in turn, give us powerful tools to improve our understanding of the physics in extreme environments as well as of the population of neutron stars as a whole. The UWL receiver of the Parkes telescope is a sensitive, versatile instrument that is allowing us to successfully time these new sources, in the bright-end of TRAPUM discoveries.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "title": "Seagrass proliferation precedes mortality during hypo-salinity events: a stress-induced morphometric response (NERP TE 5.3, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of one data file from a 10 week aquarium experiment manipulating salinity and measuring density, reproduction and growth responses of three tropical Indo-pacific seagrass species (Zostera mueller, Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis). \n\nHalophytes, such as seagrasses, predominantly form habitats in coastal and estuarine areas. These habitats can be seasonally exposed to hypo-salinity events during watershed runoff exposing them to dramatic salinity shifts and osmotic shock. The manifestation of this osmotic shock on seagrass morphology and phenology was tested.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nHypo-salinity exposure experiments were conducted on three species of seagrass, which are ubiquitous throughout the Indo-Pacific, except Zostera muelleri Irmisch ex Ascherson, which is widespread in Australia and New Zealand only. Halodule uninervis (Forsskål) Ascherson is a tropical species that occurs throughout the Indo-West Pacific in coastal and reef habitats, while Halophila ovalis R. Brown is one of the most broadly distributed seagrass species occurring throughout the Indo-West Pacific, including temperate regions, and can be found in estuarine, reef and deepwater habitats (Waycott et al., 2004). Their habitats are periodically exposed to flood plumes of reduced salinity (Furnas, 2003). Both Z. muelleri and H. uninervis are species with linear leaf blades (blady), whereas H. ovalis has pairs of ovate leaves arising from the rhizome on petioles.\n\nZostera muelleri plants were collected from Pelican Banks, Gladstone (23º45.895¿S, 151º18.244¿E) during low tide three months before the experiments started. The plants were collected using a 10 cm corer, with sediment and rhizome and roots collected intact. The cores were placed in plastic-lined pots, the plastic bag sealed over the top of the seagrass with 2 ¿ 3 cm of water during transport to the experimental facility. Halodule uninervis and H. ovalis plants were collected from Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island (19º10.612S, 146º49.737E) using the same technique two months prior to the experiments. The plants were kept in 1000L aquaria at the Aquaculture facility in James Cook University on a closed circulation system in seawater piped from Bowling Green Bay seawater intake under a 30% light-reducing roof. \n\nThe experiment consisted of 12 salinity treatments, starting from 3 PSU and increasing by 3 PSU to 36 PSU (approximate marine seawater). Salinity treatments were obtained by diluting the seawater with de-chlorinated freshwater. Every salinity treatment consisted of four replicate tanks (65L KiTab clear plastic containers) with one pot of each species per tank (i.e. n = 4). All treatments started at 36 PSU and salinity was reduced by 25% each day over four days to the target treatment salinity to mimic the more gradual decline in salinities that occur during run-off events and to minimize potential impacts from shock osmotic changes. Throughout the experiment, salinity was measured every 1-3 days using a digital salinity/conductivity/temperature meter (YSI, model 63) and salinity was adjusted when necessary to maintain salinity within 0.5 PSU of target salinity. Plant responses to these salinities were monitored for 10 weeks. Previous salinity studies indicate that seagrass changes settle down by this time (Griffin and Durako, 2012; Koch et al., 2007), and furthermore, this experimental duration is approximately equal to or more likely exceeds the length of individual hypo-salinity events in the region.\n\nThe experiments were conducted outdoors during summer/autumn months (February to April) when high ambient temperatures occur, thus chilling units were installed to moderate temperature fluctuations within the treatment tanks throughout the experiment. There were three chilled freshwater baths (1000L tanks) that were cooled using external water chillers. Each of the 12 salinity treatments had one 60L sump (60L plastic bin) that was placed randomly in one of the 3 chilling baths, each bath containing 4 sumps. The chilled baths with sumps were held underneath tables that held the experimental tanks. From each sump, water with corresponding salinity was pumped into four replicate tanks resulting in a total of 48 tanks (4 replicate tanks x 12 sumps/salinity treatments = 48 tanks in total). Each tank contained one pot of each of the three species (48 tanks x 3 species/pots = 144 pots). Temperature was recorded every 30 mins using iBCod 22L model of iBTag¿ in six randomly selected tanks for the duration of the experiment. Water temperature was 26°C on average and ranged from 22°C to 34°C reaching these temperature extremes for short periods (1-2 h) on some days. Nitrogen (N) as NH4Cl and phosphate (P) as KH2PO4 were added to the water column at very low concentrations to increase concentrations within each system by 0.05 µMol of P and 1.0 µMol of N every 2 weeks. Nutrient concentration was measured after six weeks and was found to be 0.8 µMol (±0.2) NH3, 0.4 µMol (±0.1) NOx, and 0.2 µMol (±0.8) PO4. Average light intensity under the 30% light-reducing roof was 17 mol photons m-2 d-1 of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), measured with an Odyssey 2Pi quantum sensor (Dataflow, Odyssey photosynthetic recording system) recording every 30 mins throughout the experimental period. The tanks were periodically cleaned by syphoning out sediment and organic matter accumulating at the bottom of tanks and plants were inspected every week for signs of grazing by amphipods. Amphipods were removed to prevent an outbreak, which could lead to overgrazing of the plants. Although signs of grazing were observed at times, this cleaning regime was sufficient to avoid outbreaks.\n\nThe number of shoots in each pot for Z. muelleri and H. uninervis, or the number of leaf pairs for H. ovalis were counted prior to the experiment and then weekly during the first four weeks of the experiment and fortnightly from the sixth week up to and including the tenth week. Change in shoot density (deltaSht) was calculated as a percentage change in each week relative to pre-treatment for each individual replicate:\n              deltaSht=[(Sht tx-Sht t0 )/Sht t0 ]×100\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEq 1\nwhere deltaSht is change in shoot density, Sht tx is shoot density at time x (weeks 1 through to 10) and Sht t0 is shoot density at week zero (pre-treatment).\n\nLeaf morphometrics (width and height) of Z. muelleri, H. uninervis and H. ovalis and number of leaves per shoot for the two blady species were measured after 10 weeks at treatment salinity. These data were used to calculate foliar surface area (SA) as follows:\n                SA=shoot density × (leaves per shoot-0.5)  × leaf length × leaf width\t\tEq 2\nfor blady species (H. uninervis and Z. muelleri); and,\n                SA=leaf density × pi × ((leaf length)/2)  × ((leaf width)/2)\t\t\t\t\tEq 3\nfor the ovate species H. ovalis where: \nSA is the foliar leaf area (cm2), \nshoot density are leaves per experimental pot,\nleaves per shoot are the mean number of leaves (usually 1 to 4) per seagrass shoot and \nleaf length (cm) and leaf width (cm) of the youngest fully mature leaf. \n\nA half leaf was subtracted from the total number of leaves per shoot in calculating SA of blady species to account for one leaf on each shoot being in development and therefore not full sized (Collier et al., 2012). \n\nHalophila ovalis was the only species to flower throughout the experimental period. Flowering had commenced prior to the initiation of the experiment and continued throughout. New leaf pairs are produced in H. ovalis every 3 or 4 days at experimental water temperatures (~26 - 27°C McMahon, 2005) and H. ovalis typically had 4 to 5 leaf pairs per branch. Flowering is initiated in young leaf pairs, with more advanced reproductive structures away from the growing apex. Assuming a leaf pair production rate of 4 days, we conservatively assumed that all reproductive structures present after 4 weeks (28 d) were initiated under treatment conditions. We counted all reproductive structures (male and female flowers, as well as fruits) in each pot at weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10. \n\nLeaf growth rate was measured in week 10 on the two blady species (Z. muelleri and H. uninervis) using the leaf hole punch method (McMahon, 2005). Holes were punched using a hypodermic needle in the top of the sheath of each shoot, and after 5 ¿ 7 days we measured the distance between the mark in the sheath and the mark on the leaves. We aimed to measure up to 10 shoots per replicate pot, though the actual number measured in each pot was variable depending on shoot density and visibility of marks.\n \nFor more details see the publication:\n\nCollier, C.

This will secure long-term protection of biodiversity and associated environmental values. The policy recognises the protection and management of significant bushland areas as a fundamental consideration in the planning process, while also seeking to integrate and balance wider environmental, social and economic considerations. In general terms, the policy does not prevent development where it consistent with the policy measures in this policy and other planning and environmental considerations.\n\nThe three key objectives of this policy are:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nto establish a conservation system at the regional level (through Bush Forever areas and to operate with the clearing controls under the Environmental Protection Act 1986) that is, as far as is achievable, comprehensive, adequate and representative of the ecological communities of the Swan Coastal Plain portion of the Perth Metropolitan Region; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nto seek to protect and manage significant bushland recommended for protection and management for conservation purposes through a range of implementation mechanisms and as a collective and shared responsibility and general duty of care on the part of government, landowners and the community; and \n</li>\n<li>\n\nto provide a policy and implementation framework for significant bushland areas recommended for protection and management to assist conservation planning, planning assessment and decision-making processes.\n</li>\n</ul>",

Serial Number - YC030001\nFocal Length - 69.8261mm\nImagery Type - RGB\nAcquisition Date(s) - North-South runs: 15th, 16th, 17th, 22nd &amp; 23rd July 2019 Tie/coastal strips: 22nd &amp; 23rd July 2019\nFlying Height (above MSL) - Approx 3000ft MSL for 6cm resolution, but variable due to terrain.\nCapture Methodology - Primary Runs - 95, Secondary/Tie Runs - 10\nForward / Side Overlap (%) - 70 / 40\n\n<b>Orthosmosaic</b>\n\nA digital orthophoto is a raster image of remotely sensed data in which displacement in the image due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been corrected (orthorectification). Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - &lt;3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)*\nSpatial Accuracy Notes - Based on check against selected visible survey marker coordinates (Type ‘minimark’ and ‘STAND’ with CLASS A, B, C, D) downloaded from QLDSpatial website.  Final imagery checked and accuracy verified against available cadastral data with sub 1m accuracy (B&amp;D ENTRY CONTROLLED - 0.1M, 0.25M, 0.3M, 0.5M, 1M\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - Utilised 1m Lidar DSM downloaded from https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/.  The DSM was not manually edited and no 3D  Breaklines were mapped.  In areas of disturbance or obvious terrain change eg. Mines/quarries etc, a new DSM was generated via stereo photogrammetric techniques at ½ full image resolution. The photogrammetric DSM was filtered using automated building and vegetation filter algorithms to remove some (but not all) above ground features. The filtered DSM was then gaussian smoothed and resampled to 1m resolution to match the LIDAR DTM.\nRectification Surface Accuracy Vertical - +/- 0.15m @ 67 % CI for client supplied LIDAR DTM, as per client metadata for dataset (not independently verified)\nRectification Surface Accuracy Horizontal - +/- 0.3m @ 67 % CI, as per client metadata for dataset (not verified)\nTile Size / Grid - 1km2\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2016.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This layer describes the stormwater priority areas for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Stormwater priority areas were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates. The stormwater priority area polygons were created by merging sub-catchments from University of Melbourne’s subc layer, i.e. the network of sub-catchments used for assessing attenuated imperviousness and for habitat suitability modelling. \n\n\n\nPrimary purpose for this data is identifying stormwater priority areas of Melbourne Water's Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This dataset covers the Greater Melbourne region with the stormwater priority areas presented in this dataset aligning with the priorities of the Melbourne Water Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. However, it is important to note that stormwater management activities require additional judgement to consider whether areas beyond (e.g. upstream) of the priority areas identified will also require treatment to achieve the desired waterway health outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe harvesting and infiltration targets presented in this dataset provide an estimate of what is required to achieve stormwater disconnection and recreation of the natural hydrology. However, is should be noted that these values are approximate only and do not replace site-specific investigations. The values have been calculated in reference to Walsh et al. 2012 , who presented target ranges for infiltration and harvesting required to achieve urban stormwater disconnection (i.e. re-creation of forested/vegetated hydrology). The values presented are the average of the ranges estimated by Walsh et al. 2012. These values do not replace a detailed site investigation. Site-specific factors (soil type, topography, geology and other hydrological features of the catchment) will influence the appropriate targets for a site.\n\n\n\nFor further reading on the prioritisation process see:\n\n<ul><li>Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership</li><li>Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document. Each priority area contains targets for harvesting and infiltration. Achievement of these targets is required to achieve stormwater disconnection. These targets are presented in two ways: per impervious hectare, and total volume to full urban development (i.e. complete urban development to the urban growth boundary). It should be noted that these targets are approximate values only and do not replace site-specific studies. See notes above about how target values were selected.</li></ul>\n\nFor further reading, see: Walsh, C. J., Fletcher, T. D., &amp; Burns, M. J. (2012).

The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from the 2011-12 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Australian Health Survey (AHS): National Health Measures Survey.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nPopulation in this dataset refers to 'population at risk' as modelled by the ABS. For more information, see the Explainatory Notes.\n\n\nCKD prevalence estimates are based on measures of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) to identify biomedical signs of CKD.\n\n",

    "description": "High quality digital images are captured using a digital SLR camera at the plot (core 1 hectare vegetation plot) at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory Site using the panoramic photopoint method. The panoramic photopoint method may be the most informative in open forests/woodlands and rangelands. Three photopoints are established configured in an equilateral triangle (2.5m sides) with the center marked with a star dropper and the location recorded with DGPS. At each photopoint take photographic sequences in a 360° panorama, with up to 40 photographs with a minimum 50% overlap between consecutive photographs. For more information about the method, see \n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.4287.3607\">White, el al. (2012) AusPlots Rangelands Survey Protocols Manual Version 1.2.9.</a> \n\nThe site is located at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory in Lowland Complex Mesophyll Vine Forest near Cape Tribulation. Flux monitoring was established in 2001 with additional monitoring capabilities added over time. The site has more than 80 species including canopy trees belonging to the <em>Arecaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Myristicaceae and Icacinaceae</em> families. For additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/daintree-rainforest-supersite/.\n\nOther images collected at the site include digital hemispherical photography, phenocam time-lapse images taken from fixed under and overstorey cameras, five-photopoint images, and ancilliary images of fauna and flora.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Dart Point in the east, to Callala Beach(S) in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 6 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Chemical digestion of the polycarbonate filter enabled us to determine the particulate silicon concentration for each sample (using the nutrient autoanalyser onboard the Aurora Australis, see hydrochemistry section), fibreglass filters have been dried and stored for CHN analysis back on shore.\n      \n      This work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2655 and 2679 (ASAC_2655, ASAC_2679).",

    "description": "Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. \n\nExperiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. This experiment found that when attacked by naturally occurring floaters, owners were most likely to win fights. Owners won 91.9% of fights against naturally occurring floaters. There is therefore a strong ownership advantage in this species.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "Geographic location of the outer margin of the Antarctic ice cover for the sector between longitudes 79E and 108E, including margins of ice shelves, glaciers, and iceberg tongues.  The data set does not in general include the grounding zone at the inland margin of the ice shelves or glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe margin was defined by interpretation of an image mosaic generated from Synthetic Aperture Radar data.  The image mosaic was built using navigation data accompanying the SAR images to transform the images to a map projection. The image navigation data were adjusted so that overlapping images were registered to one another, the indivual images merged into a mosaic, and the overall process adjusted so that the mosaic was tied to the few ground control points available in this large sector.  Two separate mosaics were used to span the whole sector.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the SAR data were acquired by the ERS-SAR instruments in August 1996, some ERS data were acquired in August 1993, and one Radarsat scene was acquired in September 1997.  The data were pre-processed to produce a mosaic with a 100 m pixel size, and adjusted so that the majority of the coastline positions refer to the August 1996 epoch.\r\n\r\nThe location data are internally consistent, and extracted at nominally 200 m intervals.  The external position accuracy is generally better than 600 m. The coverage is complete over the whole sector.  The coordinate set includes some island/ice rise features.  Two very large grounded icebergs are included.\r\n\r\nData are in an ascii arc/info export file format as geographic coordinates on the ITRF1996 system and contains attribute information.\r\n\r\nERS-SAR data, copyright ESA, 1993, 1996\r\n\r\nRadarsat data, copyright Canadian Space Agency, Agence spatiale canadienne, 1997.\r\n\r\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 454, 1125 and 2224 (ASAC_454, ASAC_1125 and ASAC_2224).",

    "description": "A 6m steel pole has been installed within a small bommie within Second Lagoon of One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the second lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the second lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity. The pole is available for mounting of additional third part instruments and so forms an infrastructure to support future observational work at the Island.",

The soil map covers the northern half of the Derwent 1:100 000 topographic mapsheet area. The revised map was digitally reproduced by DPIWE at a more reliable scale of 1:100 000. The soil map represents one in a series of Reconnaissance soil survey maps compiled by CSIRO for Tasmania. The data is comprised of lines and polygons.  Soil data attributes include soil mapping unit, unit code, unit description, and the Australian Soil Classification, Great Soil Group classification and soil profile class for the dominant soil. Additional soil information is displayed as annotation on both the Arcview version of the digital map and on the paper map. Attribute data for the soil profile description sample site locations displayed on the digital and non-digital map are stored in the DPIWE Oracle database. These sites were collected by CSIRO and DPIWE for a range of projects. They are listed as a separate \nmetadata entry.\nA written report describing the soil map data is available as 'Revised Brighton Reconnaissance Soil Map of Tasmania. Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment'.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who have high blood pressure. High blood pressure (or hypertension), is defined as including any of the following; systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg, or; diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg, or; receiving medication for high blood pressure. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "Preservation is defined as the capacity for coastal blue carbon decomposition to be inhibited due to saline anaerobic conditions, and for long-term sequestration within soils. Fine-grained sediments typical of alluvial floodplains, fluvial deltas and to some extent estuarine floodplains will inhibit decomposition more than sandy coastal barrier sediments (Saintilan et al., 2013) and carbon will be more concentrated in these regions. Due to significant decline in hydrodynamic energy as tributaries enter estuaries, fluvial deltas are composed predominantly of finer grain sizes (although pro-delta and delta fronts may have highly variable grain sizes) yet are influenced by tidal inundation resulting in saline conditions ideal for ongoing preservation of stored carbon. Coastal barrier sediments that are typically dominated by sands store less carbon due to greater oxidation of sediments (Kelleway et al., 2016) and in some locations, frequent reworking. \nSaintilan, N., Rogers, K., Mazumder, D., and Woodroffe, C. (2013). Allochthonous and autochthonous contributions to carbon accumulation and carbon store in southeastern Australian coastal wetlands. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 128, 84-92.",

It includes venue classification and the allocation of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) throughout Victoria.\nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data through joining it with gaming venue locations from the VCGLR's interactive map of Victoria's gaming venues extracted on the 8th of March 2019. Therefore venues that have either changed their trading name or cease to exist as of the 8th of March 2019 will not be included in this dataset, despite being active in the year expenditure was recorded. \n\n\nEGM Numbers: Average number of operating EGM's at the gaming venue during the month. This figure is consistent with the average entitlement applied to the EGM as per tax calculation.\n\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to map each groundwater works with the volumetric entitlement without double counting the volume and to aggregate/ disaggregate the data depending on the final use.\n\n\n\nThis has not been clipped to the CLM PAE, therefore the number of economic assets/ relevant licences will drastically reduce once this occurs. \n\n\n\nThe Clarence Moreton groundwater licences includes an extract of all licences that fell within the data management acquisition area as provided by BA to NSW Office of Water.\n\n\n\nAim: To get a one to one ratio of licences numbers to bore IDs. \n\nImportant notes about data:\n\nData has not been clipped to the PAE.\n\n\n\nClarence Moreton worksheet links the individual licence to a works and a volumetric entitlement. For most sites, this can be linked to a bore which can be found in the NGIS through the HydroID. (National_Groundwater_Information_System_v1.1_Sept2013 GUID = e157b1cd-3cb7-4cf9-a13c-a6bed576b8c7). This will allow analysis of depths, lithology and hydrostratigraphy where the data exists.\n\nWe can aggregate the data based on water source and water management zone as can be seen in the other worksheets. \n\n\n\nData available: \n\n\n\nOriginal Data: Any data that was bought in from NSW Offcie of Water, includes\n\nSpatial locations provided by NoW- This is a exported data from the submitted shape files. Includes the licence (LICENCE) numbers and the bore ID (WORK_NUO). (Refer to lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Entitlements Spatial Locations).\n\nSpreadsheet_WAL - The spread sheet from the submitted data, WLS-EXTRACT_WALs_volume. (Refer to Lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract CLM- Oct 2013)\n\nWLS_extracts - The combined spread sheets from the submitted data, WLS-EXTRACT .  (Refer to Lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract CLM- Oct 2013)\n\n\n\nProcessed Data: The two final products, includes\n\nCLM_Draft - this includes cancelled licences and licences where the old licence has been replaced by a share component (essentially a repeat)\n\nCLM_final- The final working linking all licences to bore IDs, removal of cancelled licences and licences that have been replaced in the new WaterAct. Also includes the volume of the licence per works \n\nAggregated share component to water sharing plan, water source and water management zone\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nNo decision have been made in regards to what purpose of groundwater should be protected. Therefore the purpose currently includes groundwater bores that have been drilled for non-extractive purposes including experimental research, test, monitoring bore, teaching, mineral explore and groundwater explore\n\nNo volume has been included for domestic & stock as it is a basic right. Therefore an arbitrary volume could be applied to account for D&S use.\n\nLicence Number - Each sheet in the Original Data has a licence number, this is assumed to be the actual licence number. Some are old  because they have not been updated to the new WA. Some are new (From_Spreadsheet_WALs). This is the reason for the different codes.\n\nWA/CA - This number is the 'works' number. It is assumed that the number indicates the bore permit or works approval. This is why there can be multiple works to licence and licences to works number.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nProcedure: \n\n\n\n1) Original spread sheets from the licence extract ( GUID d9bd77b6-5bc3-4832-a212-0e8f5ba48076) have mulitple licence instances if there are more than one WA/CA (works) number. This means that there are more than one works or permit to the licence. The aim is to only have one licence instance. \n\n\n\n2) The individual licence numbers were combined into one column \n\n\n\n3) Using the new column of licence numbers, several vlookups were created to bring in other data. Where the columns are identical in the original spreadsheets, they are combined. The only ones that dont are the Share/Entitlement/allocation, these mean different things. \n\n\n\n4) A hydro ID column was created, this is a code that links this NSW to the NGIS, which is basically a \".1.1\" at the end of the bore code.\n\n\n\n5) All 'cancelled' licences were removed\n\n\n\n6) A count of the number of works per licence and number of bores were included in the spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n7) Where the ShareComponent = NA, the Entitlement = 0, Allocation = 0 and there was more than one instance of the same bore, this means that the original licence assigned to the bore has been replaced by a new licence with a share component. Where these criteria were met, the instances were removed\n\n\n\n8) a volume per works ensures that the volume of the licence is not repeated for each works, but is divided by the number of works\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the Bioregional assessment data conversion script for methodology.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) CLM16gwl NSW Office of Water, GW licence extract linked to spatial locations in CLM v2 28022014.

    "description": "This data was collected in November 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V07.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, Nov 21, 2011\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, Nov 27, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the location of point features representing entries into the Australian Building Energy Efficiency Register spanning the years of 2011 to 2019. The data includes entries related to NABERS ratings, Tenancy Lighting Assessments and Building Energy Efficiency Certificates under the Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) program. Entries are based upon each functional space within a building, so multiples entries may be recorded for a single point location.\nThe CBD Program is an initiative of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). It was established by the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010 and is managed by the Australian Government. The CBD Program is a regulatory program that requires energy efficiency information to be provided in most cases when commercial office space of 1,000 square metres or more is offered for sale or lease. The aim is to improve the energy efficiency of Australia's large office buildings and to ensure prospective buyers and tenants are informed. The CBD Downloadable Data Set is a compilation of the entire Building Energy Efficiency Register since its commencement in 2011 into a downloadable form updated on a weekly basis.  \nFor more information, please visit:\n\n\nCommercial Building Disclosure - Downloadable Dataset.\n\n\nCommercial Building Disclosure - Frequently Asked Questions.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this dataset.\n\n\nWhile the Australian Government uses reasonable endeavours to monitor the quality of information available on the CBD website and to update this information regularly, it does not guarantee, and accepts no legal liability whatsoever arising from, or in connection with, the accuracy, reliability, currency or completeness of any material contained on this website or on any linked site.\n\n\nThe Australian Government recommends that users exercise their own skill and care with respect to their use of the CBD website, and the information contained in the CBD Downloadable Data Set.\n\n",

If you have an ongoing requirement to use the statistics, to meet a legislative or policy requirement, please seek advice from the relevant WA Government Department or Authority rather than contacting the Data Custodians listed under Key Information. If you use the reports, please include a caveat stating the following: (1) year of currency, (2) a statement that the statistics presented may now be out of date, and (3) the report citation.\nImportant update (October 2025):\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) have updated the remnant vegetation mapping and statistics for the Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes and, they are available on DataWA. Please refer to the Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics available at:\nhttps://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-region-schemes-2024-remnant-vegetation-statistics\nThe Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics provide status of remnant vegetation for the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion, the Metropolitan, Peel and portion of the Greater Bunbury Region Scheme areas, and local government areas within these regions.\nThe mapping and statistics for the South West Forest outside of the Perth and Peel Region Schemes have not been updated by DWER.\nOverview of the Report\nFrom 2016 to 2018, DBCA provided annual updates of statistics on the pre-European and current extent of the vegetation complexes of the south-west of Western Australia and are based on more detailed vegetation complex mapping than the Statewide vegetation association mapping. The statistics were used for several purposes including conservation planning, land use planning and when assessing development applications.\nThe statistics provided a general overview of the status of vegetation complexes, noting the limitations detailed in the README document relating to scale, remnant vegetation mapping and currency of the analysis. They were intended to be used in conjunction with other information on the biodiversity values of an area and with input and advice from people familiar with the vegetation complex and the vegetation condition of an area of interest.\nFor the Swan Coastal Plain and South-West Forests regions, three reports are included:\n· CAR Report - provides information on the progress towards achieving a conservation reserve system that is comprehensive, adequate, and representative (CAR Reserve Analysis);\n· Region Scheme Report – provides supporting statistics regarding EPA policies for Region Scheme areas;\n· LGA Report – summary statistics for each LGA.\nA CAR system of reserves helps conserve our biodiversity. Please contact DBCA for advice on the CAR statistics.",

    "description": "Version 2 minor revision 27 June 2024.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest compilation of land use mapping information for Australia’s regions as at December 2023. The land use data are supported by a supplementary commodities dataset, containing extra information on the location of select predominantly agricultural commodities. These datasets replace the previous 2020 December updates. \r\nVersion 2 fixes issues caused during the conversion of the state vector datasets to rasters, where single pixel horizontal lines were generated in local areas. This does not affect the date or scale of mapping.\r\n\r\nThese data were compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs and other authoritative sources through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). These datasets are not recommended for change analysis or for national land use statistics—instead use the Land use of Australia 2010-11 to 2015-16.\r\n\r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n\r\nA seamless raster dataset that combines land use vector data for all state and territory jurisdictions, at a spatial resolution of 50 by 50 metres.\r\nShows a single dominant land use for each location, based on the management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies).\r\nUpdates have been made to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, the capital city of Adelaide, parts of the Great Barrier Reef NRM regions, and national updates to select horticultural tree crops and protected cropping structures. There are also minor corrections to Western Australia, and more accurate representation of mining areas in South Australia.  \r\nThe date of mapping (2008 to 2023) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary and are provided as supporting datasets. \r\nProduced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. \r\nRefer to the metadata and ABARES website for additional information.\r\n \r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n- Provides location, extent and year verified for 185 commodities, where mapped, as a vector dataset. \r\n- Commodity data are validated in the field and using other sources.\r\n- Generally, a single commodity is shown at a location reflecting the most recent date that location was verified.\r\n- The location of a commodity may change on a seasonal to annual basis, depending on factors such as climate, markets or farming systems.\r\n- Not nationally complete or comprehensive, and with various dates of capture (1967 to 2023) and input mapping products (2014 to 2023). \r\n- Refer to the metadata for additional information.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n- Land use: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 version 2, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, June, CC BY 4.0, DOI: 10.25814/2w2p-ph98\r\n- Commodities: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "In 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to fly an airborne laser scanning survey (LiDAR) of Christmas Island. The survey was carried out using a fixed wing aircraft between the 24th and 26th of August 2011. All data was captured within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.5m to 1.2m.\nAAM classified the raw LiDAR points into the following classes using a single algorithm across the project area:\n0 Unclassified - Created, never classified\n1 Default - Unclassified\n2 Ground - Bare ground\n3 Low vegetation - 0 – 0.3m (essentially sensor 'noise')\n4 Medium vegetation - 0.3 – 2m\n5 High vegetation - 2m &gt;\n6 Buildings, structures - Buildings, houses, sheds, silos etc.\n7 Low / high points - Spurious high/low point returns (unusable)\n8 Model key points - Reserved for ‘model key points’ only\n9 Water - Any point in water\n10 Bridge - Any bridge or overpass\n11 not used - Reserved for future definition\n12 Overlap points - Flight line overlap points\nThe raw LiDAR points in the .las format were provided to Geoscience Australia along with 1km ESRI grid tiles generated by interpolation from the points. The tiles were then joined to create a DEM (TIFF) that covers the full extent of Christmas Island. Each cell, 1m x 1m, in the grid contains the height in metres of the ground surface. As a guide, the DEM data is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm. Manual checking and editing was carried out by AAM to improve accuracy. Positional accuracy has been checked by Geoscience Australia and was found to match the ground surface well.\nThe DEM data is complete for the full extent of Christmas Island.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "Sediment cells are spatially discrete areas of the coast within which marine and terrestrial landforms are likely to be connected through processes of sediment exchange, often described using sediment budgets. They include areas of sediment supply (sources), sediment loss (sinks), and the sediment transport processes linking them (pathways). Sediment transport pathways include both alongshore and cross-shore processes, and therefore cells are best represented in two-dimensions. They are natural management units with a physical basis and commonly cross jurisdictional boundaries. ",

    "description": "A dataset of enrolments (FTE) of all schools in Victoria, based on collections from the February 2023 schools census, including Government and non-Government Schools (Catholic and Independent schools).\nInformation collected from the February school census of Victorian schools: For each school, Full Time Equivalent (FTE) enrolments by school type and year level are included. A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.\nFor this 2023 census year data, the students' sex/gender category is not included for the following reasons:                       \n•   The gender of 'self-described' was implemented at the beginning of 2022 for Victorian government schools. Enrolments with this gender value are collected in the 2023 February School Census results but this value is currently under represented.      \n•   Due to the small numbers of enrolments with the 'self-described' gender, there is the potential for individuals to be identifiable at the school and year level.\n•   The 'self-described' counts are in their infancy and will likely increase over time but at this stage the department deems the risk of possible identification as too high.",

    "title": "IMOS National Reference Station (NRS) - Zooplankton Abundance",
    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\n\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nDifferent types of loading zones operate across the Brisbane City Council area. Loading zones are located and operate at times where there is a demand for a particular activity such as passenger loading or delivering goods.\nBrisbane City Council has passenger set down and pick up loading zones available across the city. The locations of these zones can change over time, so you must check local signs to make sure you do not park illegally.  \n\nThese loading zones allow passengers to be dropped off or picked up without affecting traffic flows.  \n\nIf you park longer in these loading zones, even if you remain in your car, you can be fined. Make sure these spaces are only used to pick up or drop off.\nThe following data is an indicative guide of passenger loading zone locations across Brisbane. Please ensure you follow the parking signs at all times.\nFor more information about Brisbane’s parking zones, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/parking-in-brisbane/parking-rules/parking-zones\">Brisbane City Council website</a> or phone Council’s Contact Centre on (07) 3403 8888.",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

Using a 25 m Digital Elevation Modal (DEM) coupled with orthorectified aerial photography, the THPSS of the Sydney Basin were mapped in ArcGIS. Only valley-bottom swamps were mapped. Hanging swamps or hillslope drapes were excluded. In ArcGIS, the physical attributes of the swamps were attributed and measured. This included swamp area, elevation above sea level, swamp slope, catchment area, swamp and catchment elongation ratio, swamp length and distance to coast.\nFurther information on the enforceable undertaking and the terms of the THPSS Research Program can be found at www.environment.gov.au/news/2011/10/21/centennial-coal-fund-145-million-research-program.

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R2.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January 23, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, January 30, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "    \n\nGross Benefit Salinity (gb97s = p97s a pfe97) ($/ha/yr) dataset is one of 11\nnational surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic\nopportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in\n1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a04.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2017.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Report produced in collaboration between Universities and Commonwealth and State Government agencies.  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  provide national assessments of the status of key wild-capture fish stocks. The reports provide scientifically based stock status assessments for 68 key species (or species complexes), which cumulatively contribute over 90 percent of the value and 85 percent of the volume from Australian fisheries. \r\n• Stock status assessments in the 2014 reports are based on the abundance and level of harvest in 2013. In total, 238 stocks were assessed across the 68 key species; 129 stocks were classified as sustainable, these contribute around 87.5 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. There were 7 stocks classified as transitional-recovering, 19 as transitional-depleting, 11 as overfished and 4 as environmentally limited. There were 68 stocks where status was classified as undefined; these stocks contribute 6.4 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  focus on the status of targeted fish stocks. The status classifications do not consider broader ecosystem impacts of fishing, such as bycatch or habitat impacts, or social and economic considerations. These elements may be included in future editions, or companion reports. \r\n• The reports rely on a consistent national reporting framework that was developed collaboratively by fisheries scientists from around Australia. The framework provides transparency and consistency in stock status reporting across jurisdictions. \r\n• The Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  builds on the 2012 inaugural edition with 19 new species. Four of the new species are caught in Commonwealth fisheries. The additional species were nominated by the states and the Northern Territory as either iconic species that are likely to be seen in retail outlets or historically overfished species. \r\n• There were minor alterations to the national stock status classification framework and species chapters. The main update to the framework is the inclusion of the new environmentally limited stock category. The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  Advisory Group included this additional category to describe stocks depleted below the limit reference point by environmental factors rather than fishing. \r\n• Between 2012 and 2014 there have been a number of changes to stock structure and stock status for some species. In both cases the changes are based on the most recent and reliable information available. \r\n• The reports were developed collaboratively by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) and government fishery research agencies from all states, the Northern Territory and the CSIRO; more than 100 fisheries researchers were involved. \r\n",

    "title": "Christmas Island Old Drill Lines Clearing",
    "description": "In early 2011 PRL provided Geoscience Australia with the Old Drill Hole Clearing dataset.\nThis dataset shows the location of old drill lines cleared through the rainforest on Christmas\nIsland. Drill lines were cleared to test the land for phosphate deposits and were cleared from\nthe 1950’s through to the 1970’s, before Phosphate Resources Limited (PRL) began mining\non the island.\nThe Old Drill Hole Clearing dataset has been developed from the Peg and Line grid.   PRL used Surpac to create a road outline 7 m wide (this is the\nestimate of two dozer D6 blades widths) along each of the previous drill lines. They were\nthen stitched together and made into a polygon.\nThere seems to be a good correlation between the extent of the drill lines and evidence of\nclearing from the 1987 orthophotography.\nThe accuracy of the Peg and Line used as a base when the shapefile was produced is of\nrelevance. The error in the data appears to be in the vicinity of 100 metres. As clearing\nboundaries and coast (though highly simplified) of the same map plot in far better position\n(after transformation) in relation to the orthophotographs and other GIS themes, the majority\nof inaccuracy in this theme is probably inherited from the original map (abbsite.dwg). That\nis, it appears that the clearings and coast of abbsite.dwg are reasonably accurate though very\nimprecise (intended to be viewed at much greater scale), while the line and peg grid appears\nless accurate. Thus the grid on the GIS is mainly illustrative at this time.\nThere are no attributes assigned to the data.\nDisclaimer",

    "title": "Geochemistry of drill core samples from the Stuart Shelf region, South Australia",
    "description": "The Exploring for the Future (EFTF) program is an Australian government initiative aimed at stimulating investment in resource exploration and development. It operates multiple interconnected projects, such as the Australia’s Resources Framework (ARF), a continental-scale endeavor to enhance understanding of Australia's geology and resource potential. A module of ARF, the Geochemistry for Basin Prospectivity (G4BP), studies Australian basins with prospective base metal mineral systems. \n\n\n\nThe current report focuses on the Neoproterozoic segment of the Stuart Shelf region in South Australia, a part of the Adelaide Rift Complex. This research is conducted collaboratively with the Geological Survey of South Australia, examining sediment-hosted copper potential in the rift complex.\n\n\n\nThe Adelaide Rift Complex is a geological formation that underwent extensive sedimentation from the Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian, particularly within the rift zone. Stuart Shelf sediments overlay Mesoproterozoic magmatic and Paleoproterozoic metasediment layers. The complex hosts multiple copper deposits, which are usually associated with movement of basinal brines that leach metals from lower basinal layers or rift-related volcanic rocks.\n\n\n\nTo improve understanding of the geology of the Stuart Shelf and related copper mineralisation, two primary objectives were set: \n\n\n\n1. Geochemical fingerprinting and baseline data collection: This involves compilation and reanalysis of existing data, along with new data collection aimed at providing comprehensive geochemical data for stratigraphic units within the Stuart Shelf.\n\n\n\n2. Identification of mineral system components: Utilising data from the first objective, this phase aims to identify potential metal and fluid sources and potential sites of metal deposition. \n\nIn conjunction with these efforts, a GA-GSSA geochemical sampling project is underway, tying geochemistry to lithostratigraphic units and facies. The newly acquired geochemical data will be integrated into the overall GSSA-CSIRO project to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the sediment-hosted stratabound mineral system.\n\n",
