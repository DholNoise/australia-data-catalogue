Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30, or obese if their BMI was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced.

The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and attended 5 or more antenatal visits, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWomen who gave birth at 32 weeks or more gestation to a livebirth or a stillbirth, with known number of antenatal visits (includes women with no antenatal care).\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The commissioning of new dedicated FRB detection systems has led to an exponential increase in the detected FRBs over the last decade. Despite &gt;700 FRBs published to date, there is still a lack of understanding about the physical mechanisms through which FRB emission is produced. Due to the possibility of detecting multiple bursts from the same source in a repeating FRB, it forms an ideal sample set to uncover the physics of the source (e.g., emission mechanism, progenitor surrounding media), and test possible progenitor models. The coherent upgrade to the FRB detection system to ASKAP is expected to detect ~1-2 FRB/week. However, due to the limited fractional bandwidth available with ASKAP and survey nature of the telescope, probing the spectro-polarimetric characteristics of repeating sources is non-optimal. Hence, the large bandwidth offered by the ultra wideband-low (UWL) on Parkes/Murriyang is an ideal instrument to follow-up repeating FRB sources discovered through CRACO. Over the next ~6 months, we expect to double the number of repeaters that have been studied through the UWL. This will provide unprecedented insight into the progenitor environment and the surrounding media of repeating FRBs. We propose using the UWL to follow up repeater-like sources to study their wideband spectro-polarimetric characteristics.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

Gunnedah, its largest town, is located at the heart of the Gunnedah LGA, with Carroll situated 25 kilometres to the east of Gunnedah. Sydney is located 480 kilometres south-east of Gunnedah, while Tamworth is approximately 70 kilometres to the east of Gunnedah. Both Gunnedah and Carroll lie on the floodplains of the Namoi River Valley. Carroll is upstream of Gunnedah, approximately 17.5 kilometres from the junction of the Peel and Namoi Rivers, and Gunnedah is approximately 4 kilometres downstream from the confluence of the Mooki and Namoi Rivers. The primary objectives are:\n<ul>\n<li>to reduce the social and economic impact of flooding on individual owners and occupiers of flood prone property; </li>\n<li>to reduce private and public losses resulting from floods.</li>\n<li>to mitigate the impacts of flooding on essential service infrastructure;</li>\n<li>to minimise adverse economic impacts on the commercial centre of Gunnedah;</li>\n<li>to maintain the urban/rural lifestyle of Gunnedah;</li>\n<li>to maintain the rural residential lifestyle in Carroll;</li>\n<li>to utilise ecologically sustainable methods for flood mitigation where possible; and</li>\n<li>to retain the social and environmental benefits to the residents resulting from the proximity of both towns to the Namoi River.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC10) was collected from a depth of 335 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Isotopic values for 18O and 13C were obtained from Gs. ruber and correlated with the SPECMAP age-model. Radiocarbon dating of G. sacculifer was also undertaken at three sample depths, and then corrected and correlated with the curve. This yielded an age vs. depth profile from which it was possible to determine approximate sedimentation rates. The results place the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) date at 130cm and highlights a peak in sedimentation rate during the penultimate glacial / interglacial transition. Down the core the sedimentation rates vary considerably from a high of 12 cm/kyr down to <1 cm/kyr. This is probably the result of a considerable change in the sediment flux related to the sea level fluctuations.",

    "description": "The River Murray Channel Monitoring Plan (RMCMP) focuses on monitoring River Murray system scale responses to coordinated water for environment delivery in the Southern Connected Murray-Darling Basin. It builds on existing monitoring programs to fill gaps and to evaluate ecological responses to flow at as system scale, to inform and improve the way water for the environment is managed.\r\n\r\nImplementation of the RMCMP is expected to significantly improve monitoring coverage in the River Murray, focusing on productivity and fish indicators that will directly inform improved management and coordination of flows. Implementation is expected to focus on 2021-22 in the first instance, with commitments for future years not yet made. A key element of the Plan is an annual review of implementation, which will inform any refinements to the Plan over the five year period.\r\n\r\nThe RMCMP, jointly funded by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) and Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), examines the productivity and fish responses to flow in the River Murray Channel. Monitoring occurs at 4 reaches: 1) Hume to Torrumbarry, 2) Torrumbarry to Euston, 3) Euston to SA border and 4) SA border to Wellington. The data set includes fish census (abundance, length), ageing (otolith) and length/weight data. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dcceew.gov.au/water/cewo/publications/river-murray-channel-monitoring-plan-2021-22-to-2025-26\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH RMCMP (2023) <INSERT DATASET TITLE>.

    "description": "This Pre-Clearing map represents the pre-clearing extent of the State Vegetation Type Map (SVTM).  Both SVTM and SVTM (Pre-Clearing) map each Plant Community Type, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation at a regional scale across all tenures in NSW. Pre-clearing PCT mapping is available for both eastern NSW and Far Western NSW. Coverage of Central NSW is a work in progress. \n\nPre-clearing extent of PCTs was developed using a combination of aerial photographic interpretation, environmental layers and historical documents. This map is updated periodically as part of the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/integrated-bionet-vegetation-data-for-nsw\">Integrated BioNet Vegetation Data</a> program to improve quality and alignment to the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy. \n\nFurther information and technical documents about the SVTM is available from the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/state-vegetation-type-map\">State Vegetation Type Mapping Program Page</a>\n\n<strong>Current Release C2.0.M2.2 (December 2025)</strong>\n\nThis release includes revisions, using the most recent NSW PCT Classification Master list (represented by “C2.0” in the version release number). PCT spatial distributions were manually edited based on user and community feedback since the previous C2.0.M2.1 release. \n\nDetailed technical information is available <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/nsw-state-vegetation-type-map-technical-notes-2025\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>Data Access</strong>\n\nMap data may be downloaded, viewed within the SEED Map Viewer, or accessed via the underlying ArcGIS REST Services or WMS for integration in GIS or business applications. \n\nThe Trees Near Me NSW app provides quick access to view the map using a mobile device or desktop. Download the app from Google Play or the App Store, or access the web site at <a href=\"https://www.treesnearme.app/explore\">https://treesnearme.app</a>.\n\n<strong>Map Data Type</strong>\n\nThe map is supplied as ESRI Feature Class (Quickview) and 5m GeoTiff Raster, and can be viewed and analysed in most commercial and open-source spatial software packages. If you prefer to use the download package, we supply an ArcGIS v10.8 mxd and/or a layer file for suggested symbology. The raster attributes contain PCT, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation.\n\n<strong>Feedback and Support</strong>\n\nWe welcome your feedback to assist us in continuously improving our products. To help us track and process your feedback, please use the SEED Data Feedback tool available via the SEED map viewer or the Feedback function in Trees Near Me NSW. \n\nFor further support, contact the BioNet Team at <em><a href=\"mailto:bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au</a></em>.\n\n<strong>Useful Related Data</strong>\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-state-vegetation-type-map\">NSW State Vegetation Type Map</a>: regional scale map of extant NSW Plant Community Types, Vegetation classes and Vegetation Formations.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-bionet-flora-survey-data-collection-pctreferencesites\">NSW BioNet Flora Survey Plots – PCT Reference Sites</a>: full floristic plots used in the development of the quantitative Plant Community Type (PCT) classification.

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1989 to February 1990. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "Regional Development Australia (with LGA's) 2015-16 (April 2016) \r\n\r\nRegional Development Australia (RDA) is an Australian Government initiative that brings together all levels of government to enhance the growth and development of Australia's regions. A national network of RDA committees has been established to achieve this objective. \r\n\r\nRDA Regions are created and maintained by the Dept. of Infrastructure and Regional Development to support this initiative. \r\n\r\nNotes \r\n\r\nThe RDA Regions (2015-16) were built from the ABS/PSMA LGA 2015 boundary dataset. \r\n\r\nThe RDA spatial data is updated as new LGA boundaries are released by ABS or as RDA regional boundaries move. \r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August 2011, the RDA representation of Lord Howe Island, previously RDA Northern Rivers was changed to RDA Mid North Coast. The 2011 dataset was updated to reflect this change. \r\n\r\nNT, Tas and ACT \r\n\r\nThese states and territories are defined as single RD regions. West Daly RC, which deamalgamated from Victoria-Daly RC was added 1/7/14.\r\n\r\nIn Tas, Macquarie Island is part of the Huon Valley LGA (due to historical decisions)\r\n\r\nSA \r\n\r\nRDA regions are not completely defined within LGA boundaries, with some RDA regions being defined from the previously existing 2007 South Australia Government Region boundaries. Thus, the large unincorporated LGA (Outback Communities Authority) is divided between 3 RDAs (see SA Government Regions for more information). \r\n\r\nMore work has also been done on identifying Outback Community Authority islands (which have been incorporated into their respective RDA's)\r\n\r\nNSW \r\n\r\nRDA South Coast includes the external territory of Jervis Bay. In previous data releases, Lord Howe Island (part of the ABS Unincorporated NSW) was part of RDA Northern Rivers. On the 16 of August 2011, Lord Howe Island was to be represented by Mid North Coast and is under the control of the LHI Board. \r\n\r\nNorfolk Island IS NOT YET part of any RDA \r\n\r\nThere has also been more work around Sydney Harbour identifying NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and Sydney Harbour Trust Islands.  The remainder of Unincorporated NSW now falls under the control of NSW Trade and Investment: Crown Lands\r\n\r\nVIC \r\n\r\nUnincorporated VIC (Snow fields and Islands) have been combined into their surrounding RDA's \r\n\r\nWA \r\n\r\nThe external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos/Keeling Islands are part of RD Mid West Gascoyne. \r\n\r\nRottnest Is has been separated from the City of Cockburn (as it is governed by an Authority), and Carnac, Edwards and Lancelin Islands have been identified as falling under the control of DPaW.\r\n\r\nThere was also an amalgamation between the City of Geraldton-Greenough and Shire of Mullewa on the 1st of July 2011 to form the City of Greater Geraldton. The LGA code for Geraldton-Greenough (53520) was retained for the new City of Greater Geraldton. \r\n\r\nQLD \r\n\r\nOn the 1/1/14, 4 councils deamalgamated. Mareeba Shire reformed from Tablelands Regional, Douglas Shire reformed from Cairns Regional, Livingstone Shire from Rockhampton Regional and Noosa Shire from Sunshine Coast Regional. LGA boundaries had minor adjustments from the 2007 boundaries, but there were no changes to the RDA boundaries. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset represents measurements collected from a network of 75 urban glow sensors within the Bundaberg Region. The principal data sets are point data representing the readings from the Sky Quality Meter (SQM) sensors. Data from all sensors are processed every 15 minutes using natural neighbour interpolation to generate a raster of urban glow across two sub-networks (City and Coastal).\r\n\r\n__Vector Point Data__\r\n\r\nThe point data are contained as individual feature classes for each processing time within an ArcGIS file geodatabase\r\n\r\n* ID: The SQM site identifier\r\n* Description: The locality and the number of the SQM in that locality.\r\n* deviceGroup: The categorisation of the SQM devices for processing of the data within sub-networks (i.e. coastal network or city network)\r\n* obsLocalTime: The date and time in Australian Eastern Standard time (UTC+10) of the observation\r\n* magnitude: SQM reading is a numeric value indicating the relative brightness of the night sky. Lower numbers indicate a brighter sky, while higher numbers indicate a darker sky. A dark sky with minimal light pollution typically registers as 22 or above. Units are measured in magnitudes per square arc second.\r\n* skyTemp: The temperature of the nearest object (i.e. clouds) in a 10 degree field of view above the sensor. This value will be low if there is nothing, but higher if there is cloud.\r\n* ambTemp: Measurement of ambient air temperature taken at the specified point in time.\r\n* cloudCover: skyTemp & ambTemp reading values are translated as follows:\r\n    * no cloud cover\r\n    * minimal effects from cloud cover\r\n    * moderate/medium effects from cloud cover\r\n    * high impact from cloud cover\r\n\r\n__Raster Data__\r\n \r\nA Natural Neighbour interpolation has been performed using the sites with valid SQM values to produce a Geotiff raster to depict the hot spots or bright areas of urban glow\r\n\r\n__Mapbooks__\r\n\r\nThe input points and the generated hotspot raster are compiled into a nightly PDF map book for easy interpretation of the results.\r\n\r\nThe Reducing Urban Glow project page can be found here https://www.bundaberg.qld.gov.au/environment/reducing-urban-glow",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated lucerne</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment.

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST012008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, April 10, 2008\nArrived:  \tSydney, New South Wales, April 14, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program seeks to understand the potential impacts associated with developing unconventional energy resources in key Australian basins. As a potential source of land use change, future seismic data acquisition may cause cumulative land change that may need to be quantified for such a holistic impact assessment. Given the extent of seismic exploration for conventional resources within the Cooper Basin, existing data could provide insight into survey parameters that may be representative of future surveys in the region. We perform an analysis of the historical seismic survey occurrence and acquisition parameters for the existing data in the Cooper GBA region. The spatio-temporal data analysis is used to derive a simple model that could be used as a forecasting tool for seismic survey parameters of interest (e.g. line kilometers) in a forward looking risk assessment.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis presents a data analysis of the datasets: \r\n•\tSeismic survey 3D - QLD\r\n•\tSeismic survey 2D - QLD\r\n•\tSouth Australian 2D Seismic Lines \r\n•\tSouth Australia 3D Seismic Survey Areas\r\n•\tPetroleum well locations – Queensland\r\n•\tPetroleum well locations - South Australia",

    "description": "This data was collected in August 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST022010.\n\nDeparted:  Fremantle, Australia, August 10, 2010\nArrived:  \tHobart, Australia, August 20, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

These surveys are run conjunction with the Eastern Australian Waterbird Survey (EAWS) since 1983.\r\n\r\nThe sourcing of this data was done predominately through a third-party external provider through contract agreements.\r\n\r\nRecently, Geoscience Australia has been developing a Wetland Insight Tool (WIT) to allow users to observe the spatiotemporal behaviour of wetlands in Australia.  The outcomes generated by this tool provide an insight into wetland habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Basin Plan Evaluation 2020 products\r\nA range of products have been developed and released as part of the Basin Plan Evaluation 2020.\r\n\r\n[Link to content landing zone](https://www.mdba.gov.au/water-management/basin-plan/basin-plan-evaluations/2020-basin-plan-evaluation)\r\n\r\n[Link to reports and data page](https://www.mdba.gov.au/publications-and-data/publications/2020-basin-plan-evaluation-reports-and-data)\r\n",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Leveque Shelf (survey number SOL5754/GA0340), a sub-basin of the Browse Basin, in May 2013. This survey provides seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the Browse sedimentary basin. The basin, located on the Northwest Shelf, Western Australia, was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially suitable for CO2 storage. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The principal aim of the Leveque Shelf marine survey was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Leveque Shelf area that may extend to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research, combined with deeper geological studies undertaken concurrently, addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit, i.e. the basal sedimentary section (Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous), and the regional integrity of the Jamieson Formation (the seal unit overlying the main reservoir). This dataset comprises total chlorin concentrations and chlorin indices from the upper 2cm of seabed sediments.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.",

    "description": "This dataset shows the attendance rates for all NSW government schools in Semester One by alphabetical order. \nData Notes:\n\n\n2021 data is not comparable to previous years due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to calculation rules to align with ACARA’s national standards (version 3) and changes to the way attendance data is transferred into the department’s centralised data warehouse. Please refer to 2021 Semester 1 student attendance factsheet for more information.\n\n\n2020 data is not provided because students were encouraged to learn from home for several weeks in Semester 1. Please refer to the factsheet on The effects of COVID-19 on attendance during Semester 1 2020 for more information.\n\n\nIn 2018 NSW government schools implemented the national standards for student attendance data reporting. This resulted in a fall in attendance rates for most schools due to the inclusion of part day absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation. Data from 2018 onwards is not comparable with earlier years.\n\n\nSchools for Specific Purposes (SSPs) are only included from 2021. Prior to this SSP attendance data was not collected centrally.\n\n\nThe attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student days attended by full-time students in Years 1–10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended in Semester 1. Figures are aligned with the National Report on Schooling and the My School website.\n\n\nData is suppressed \"sp\" for schools where student numbers are below the reporting threshold.\n\n\nData is not available \"na\" for senior secondary schools or other schools where no students were enrolled in Years 1-10.\n\n\nBlank cells indicate no students were enrolled at the school that census year or the school was out of scope for attendance reporting.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nEducation Statistics &amp; Measurement, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation\n",

    "description": "This project aims to continue to perform rapid measurements of relativistic parameters of southern binary pulsar systems using data from the Parkes Ultra Wideband Low (UWL) receiver and the MeerKAT telescope thereby enabling measurement of their component masses and in some cases, test theories of gravity. We will use the UWL data to obtain significant orbital coverage and timing baseline on these pulsars and obtain important constraints on orbital and temporal DM variations that will help in identifying the nature of the companion star. We will then use MeerKAT data at crucial orbital phases to improve our chances of measuring the relativistic parameters. Increase in the number of measured NS masses has profound implications for NS internal structure and for stellar and binary evolution physics.",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of areas subject to overland flow flooding inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. \n\nThe overall overland flow layer consists of the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (100 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) flood extent sourced from the Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path mapping study (GHD, 2017).\n\nHigh impact area:\n\nIn high impact areas, overland flow is almost certain to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 5% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings.\n\nMedium impact area:\n\nFor the majority of medium impact areas, overland flow is very likely to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 2% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings, however these hazards are experienced less frequently than in high impact areas.\n\nLow impact area:\n\nFor the majority of low impact areas, overland flow is likely to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally safe for people, vehicles and buildings; however, certain areas can experience greater hazards.\n\nlink in the Data and resources section on this page.\n\nDue to a system issue, this data is not displayed here.

Measurements are taken using a geological compass. Surfaces are recorded as dip - dip direction. Lineations are recorded as plunge - azimuth. Declination measured to magnetic north then corrected to true north automatically within the database. A small amount of pre-1995 structural data has been digitised from previous maps.\nField data is either recorded in a notebook in the field then typed into the database or recorded digitally in the field and automatically transferred into the database (this applies to the majority of data collected since 2002).\nDisplay - structural measurements have been divided into four categories to simplify display. Bedding contains measurements of sedimentary bedding where the bedding surface is upright, overturned or younging unknown. Foliation contains measurements of the commonly measured foliations seen in rocks such as cleavages etc. Folds contains measurements of structures directly associated with folds such as fold axis, axial surface etc. Other contains all other structural measurements including faults, joints, quartz vein orientations etc.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months from May to December for 2001 and includes the total over the months. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

    "description": "National Flying-Fox Monitoring Program (NFFMP) camp register.\nThe national flying-fox monitoring program commenced in 2013 and is a collaborative project between the Australian, NSW, Queensland, Victorian, South Australian and ACT Governments and CSIRO Land and Water. It involves quarterly counts at all known daytime roost sites of grey-headed and spectacled flying-foxes across both species' national ranges, and at black and little-red flying-fox camps where those camps occur within the range of the previous two species or outside these ranges, where monitoring is possible. The aim of the program is to establish a reliable benchmark for flying-fox populations in 2013 and monitor trends in abundance and distribution in subsequent years. Counts are carried out using a robust scientific methodology developed by the CSIRO Land and Water (this method is described at http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/391f5fed-e287-4dd3-85ac-640037926ef5/files/310112-monitoring-methodology.pdf,  http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/status-and-trends-australias-epbc-listed-flying-foxes). The first full NFFMP census of grey-headed flying-foxes took place on 14-16 February 2013 and was the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken for this species. \n\nThe NFFMP is coordinated by CSIRO Land and Water and Department of Environment in collaboration with the participating state governments.\n\nThis dataset contains all the flying-fox census data collected under the NFFMP (up to and including survey results reflected in the data revision date).\nRestricted\nThe long term ambition of the NFFMP is to make the data publicly available. However, at present the camps and counts data are not available for public release via direct data download. Aggregated data are displayed by an external facing WebGIS viewer. Data could be released for research purposes under standard licence by negotiation with NFFMP.\nDiscuss any use of the data with NFFMP body",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw three or more health professionals for the same condition in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset contains hourly pedestrian counts since 2009 from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated on a monthly basis and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.\nThe sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-sensor-locations/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations</a> dataset which details the location, status and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting pedestrian counts over time.\nImportants notes about this dataset:• Where no pedestrians have passed underneath a sensor during an hour, a count of zero will be shown for the sensor for that hour.• Directional readings are not included, though we hope to make this available later in the year. Directional readings are provided in the <a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-past-hour-counts-per-minute/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)</a> dataset.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/city-population/Pages/pedestrian-counting-system.aspx\">Pedestrian Counting System</a> helps to understand how people use different city locations at different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future.

The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the main lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the main lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity. The pole is available for mounting of additional third part instruments and so forms an infrastructure to support future observational work at the Island.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Oriental fruit fly model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "On the Australian margin, submarine canyons have formed along all sides of the continent and are exposed to the potential influence of large-scale ocean currents, including the Leeuwin Current and the East Australian Current. Recognised in marine bioregional plans as potential biodiversity hotspots, many of these canyons sit within the new national network of Commonwealth Marine Reserves. This GIS polygon layer contains 753 submarine canyons along the Australian continental margin and external territories. The locations and extents of these canyons were derived from a range of bathymetry datasets. The layer has attributes describing the canyon's shape, morphometric and geographic characteristics. The definitions are as follows. SHAPE_Leng: Perimeter SHAPE_Area: Planar area centreli_L: Centreline length; total length of canyon/sub-canyons centreline(s) MBG_Width: Minimum bounding rectangle width MBG_Length: Minimum bounding rectangle length MBG_Orient: Minimum bounding rectangle orientation len_wid_ra: Length to width ratio; a measure of elongation; larger the value the more elongate the canyon border_ind: Border index; a measure of geometric complexity; larger he value the more fractal the canyon compactnes: a measure of compactness; larger the value the more compact the canyon (or the smaller its border) no_branch: Number of sub-canyons head_incis: Head incision; incision deph of canyon head head_depth: Head depth; water depth of canyon head foot_depth: Foot depth; water depth of canyon foot depth_rang: Depth range; depth range between canyon head and foot slope_mean: Slope mean; average slope gradients within canyon polygon slope_std: Slope standard deviation; standard deviation of the slope gradients within canyon polygon slope_rang: Slope range; range between maximum and minimum slope gradients within canyon polygon surArea1: Surface area; 3-D surface area of canyon rugosity: Rugosity; roughness of canyon surface volume: Volume; 3-D volume enclosed by the canyon bottom and walls head_x: X coordinate of canyon head; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection head_y: Y coordinate of canyon head; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection foot_x: X coordinate of canyon foot; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection foot_y: Y coordinate of canyon foot; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection h_f_dist: Head to foot distance; euclidian distance between canyon head and foot h_f_slope: head to foot slope; slope gradient between canyon head and foot dist_shelf: Distance to shelf; euclidian distance of canyon to shelf break; a distance of zero indicates that canyon touchs or intersects the shelf break or within the continental shelf near_canyo: Nearest canyon; euclidian distance to the nearest canyon dist_coast: Distance to coast; euclidian distance of canyon to Australian coast focal_var: Focal variety; number of neighbouring canyons within a nominated proximity inci_depth: Incision depth; averged depth of canyon area that incises into shelf break; slope-confined canyons have values of zero inci_area: Incision area; area of canyon area that incises into shelf break; slope-confined canyons have values of zero slope15: Percentage of slope gradient greater than 15 degree; percentage of canyon area with slope gradients greater than 15 degree sinuosity: a measure of the quality of being sinuous; larger the value the more sinuous the canyon shelf_inci: Shelf incision; shlef-incising canyons have value of 1; slope-confined canyons have value of zero dist_river: Distance to revier; euclidian distance to the mouth of the nearest permanent river uncertain: Uncertainty; mapping uncertainty assigned to canyon; larger the value the more uncertain the mapping is marine_reg: Marine region; the location of the canyon in one of the marine regions canyon_nam: The name of canyon if known map_region: Map region; the location of canyon in one of the map regions Please refer to Marine Geology 357, 362-383 for details of mapping methods.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset contains status, location and directional information for each pedestrian sensor device installed throughout the city.  The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with related datasets. \n\nSince the inauguration of the <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/city-population/Pages/pedestrian-counting-system.aspx\">Pedestrian Counting System</a> in 2009, some sensor devices have been removed or relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works. Others may be inactive due to a temporary issue. This is detailed in the notes column.  Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.\n\nSensors are typically installed under an awning or on a street pole to form a counting zone on the footpath below. They record bi-directional pedestrian movements through the zone, 24 hours, every day. Locations are selected based on three criteria – retail and event activity, regular pedestrian use and the egress and entry flow to these areas. The system records movements, not images, so no individual information is collected.  New sensor devices have been recently installed, with more to come in the near future as part of the city’s commitment to expanding the system. \n\nStatus field:\nThis field indicates if the sensor is expected to be active and is manually maintained as needed. A pedestrian sensor with an active value ('A') may be unavailable in some situations. \n\nA representation of pedestrian volume which compares each location on any given day and time can be found in our <a href=\"http://www.pedestrian.melbourne.vic.gov.au/?_ga=2.44607906.760678413.1541972518-340051665.1506055261\">Online Visualisation</a>.\nRelated datasets: <b><a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-monthly-counts-per-hour/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System – 2009 to Present (counts per hour)</a></b><b><a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-past-hour-counts-per-minute/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)</a></b>",

    "description": "The Timor North deepwater mooring was first deployed on 2011-06-14 at (8.86 S, 127.20 E) in the Indonesian Throughflow.\n\nInstrumentation includes 150 kHz and 75kHz ADCPs, Seabird SBE39s, discrete current meters and Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES).\n\nThe mooring provides profile velocity data above 500m and point source velocity between 500m and 1200m (depth of controlling sill). Temperature and salinity data are collected for the entire water column.\n\nThe aim of IMOS Indonsian Throughflow moorings (Indoflow) is to sustainably and directly measure the leakage of Pacific thermocline and intermediate waters from the western equatorial Pacific into the South Indian Ocean. The Indonesian Passages represent an important 'choke point' of the global ocean overturning circulation and the climate system. The interannual to decadal variability of the size and depth distribution of the flow through this choke point remains a troublesome unknown. In particular, changes in this flow will reflect long term changes in the Pacific and Indian Ocean wind fields, particularly any change in the Walker Circulation, as predicted by coupled climate models forced by increasing Greenhouse Gas scenarios. Changes in the associated heat flux are also anticipated at the global oceans warm. The Indoflow array design is based on the more comprehensive INSTANT process study and is deemed the minimal required mooring array to monitor the Indonesian Throughflow. The Ombai Strait and Timor Passage Throughflow components comprise about 11Sv of the 14 Sv total interbasin exchange. The Indoflow array integrates with the AIMS NAOS shelf line, allowing estimates of the interbasin exchange to include the transport of very warm waters across the Australian North West Shelf. All moorings in the Timor Passage are located along a high precision swath line of the TOPEX/Jason satellite altimeter missions. These data will shed light on how best to exploit altimetric data over our shallow northern shelves, especially in data assimilating models.",

Two time periods are provided in the south west agricultural zone only where the Land Monitor index can be more confidently applied, these time periods are 1990-current year and the last 10 years. The summaries are statistical measures of mean, linear trend over time, quadratic trend over time, standard deviation about mean, residual standard deviation after fitting linear trend and residual standard deviation after fitting linear and quadratic trends. The statistical summaries can be displayed separately or together to summarise trends and stability of vegetation over time as measured by the Land Monitor vegetation index, and in particular to highlight areas with different patterns of change.\n\nClick <a href=\"https://data.wa.gov.au/land-monitor\">here</a> for more information.",

    "description": "We propose to continue undertake a pulsar survey along the Galactic Plane using the new Methanol Multibeam receiver in order to uncover pulsars previously selected against in lower frequency surveys. The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies. Simulations have shown that we expect to find a total of 200 pulsars of which about one half will be new detections.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory.

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The commissioning of new dedicated FRB detection systems has led to an exponential increase in the detected FRBs over the last decade. Despite &gt;700 FRBs published to date, there is still a lack of understanding about the physical mechanisms through which FRB emission is produced. Due to the possibility of detecting multiple bursts from the same source in a repeating FRB, it forms an ideal sample set to uncover the physics of the source (e.g., emission mechanism, progenitor surrounding media), and test possible progenitor models. The coherent upgrade to the FRB detection system to ASKAP is expected to detect ~1-2 FRB/week. However, due to the limited fractional bandwidth available with ASKAP and survey nature of the telescope, probing the spectro-polarimetric characteristics of repeating sources is non-optimal. Hence, the large bandwidth offered by the ultra wideband-low (UWL) on Parkes/Murriyang is an ideal instrument to follow-up repeating FRB sources discovered through CRACO. Over the next ~6 months, we expect to double the number of repeaters that have been studied through the UWL. This will provide unprecedented insight into the progenitor environment and the surrounding media of repeating FRBs. We propose using the UWL to follow up repeater-like sources to study their wideband spectro-polarimetric characteristics.",

This vessel circumnavigated Australia every 28 days with an additional stop in the Port of Singapore. Underway T, S and F were measured continuously throughout the period of the project. At times an observer was on board and collected samples from the outflow of the underway system for the determination of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, the absorption co-efficient for the dissolved component (aCDOM) of the water and salinity. In all 277 samples were collected during the 10 month period of the project. Retrieved chlorophyll a estimates from the SeaWifs ocean colour sensor were also collected and compared with the in situ data.",

Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2012 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 1,139,275 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/vbe9-m4tk.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.51GB, 52.5 million rows)",

    "description": "This dataset captures the diversity of students with a language background other than English (LBOTE) who are enrolled in NSW government schools. \nData Notes:\n\n\nLBOTE students are those in whose home a language other than English is spoken by the student, parents, or other primary caregivers.\n\n\nLBOTE and total (headcount) enrolment figures are collected in March of each year. Most other collections use enrolment data that are collected as part of the Mid Year Census in August. \n\n\nThe table is ordered by the largest language groups for language groups with 1000 or more students in the most recent year presented. Language groups with fewer than 1000 students are included in 'other language groups'.\n\n\nIndian and Chinese Languages are included as a combined total, and also as separate distinct languages. Therefore Indian and Chinese data appears twice in the table. \n\n\nDue to rounding issues, the total percentage for Indian and Chinese Language groups may be slightly different to the sum of the distinct languages.\n\n\nThere can be minor changes in the categorization of less common languages and dialects over time. For example, these definitional variations account for the difference in the 2018 total as reported in the ‘Enrolments of LBOTE government school students by largest language groups’ table in the 2018 and 2019 LBOTE bulletins. \n\n\nData Source:\n\nCentre for Education Statistics and Evaluation, NSW Department of Education.\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "This layer describes the stormwater priority areas for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Stormwater priority areas were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates. The stormwater priority area polygons were created by merging sub-catchments from University of Melbourne’s subc layer, i.e. the network of sub-catchments used for assessing attenuated imperviousness and for habitat suitability modelling. Primary purpose for this data is identifying stormwater priority areas of Melbourne Water's Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This dataset covers the Greater Melbourne region with the stormwater priority areas presented in this dataset aligning with the priorities of the Melbourne Water Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. However, it is important to note that stormwater management activities require additional judgement to consider whether areas beyond (e.g. upstream) of the priority areas identified will also require treatment to achieve the desired waterway health outcomes.The harvesting and infiltration targets presented in this dataset provide an estimate of what is required to achieve stormwater disconnection and recreation of the natural hydrology. However, is should be noted that these values are approximate only and do not replace site-specific investigations. The values have been calculated in reference to Walsh et al. 2012 , who presented target ranges for infiltration and harvesting required to achieve urban stormwater disconnection (i.e. re-creation of forested/vegetated hydrology). The values presented are the average of the ranges estimated by Walsh et al. 2012. These values do not replace a detailed site investigation. Site-specific factors (soil type, topography, geology and other hydrological features of the catchment) will influence the appropriate targets for a site.For further reading on the prioritisation process see:Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice PartnershipMelbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document. Each priority area contains targets for harvesting and infiltration. Achievement of these targets is required to achieve stormwater disconnection. These targets are presented in two ways: per impervious hectare, and total volume to full urban development (i.e. complete urban development to the urban growth boundary). It should be noted that these targets are approximate values only and do not replace site-specific studies. See notes above about how target values were selected.For further reading, see: Walsh, C. J., Fletcher, T. D., &amp; Burns, M. J. (2012). Urban stormwater runoff: a new class of environmental flow problem.

    "description": "This resource contains surface sediment data for Outer Darwin Harbour collected by Geoscience Australia during the period from 28 May and 23 June 2015 on the RV Solander (survey SOL6187/GA0351). Partners involved in the survey included the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Department of Land Resource Management (Northern Territory Government). The survey was funded through the INPEX Offset Habitat Mapping Program for the Darwin Harbour region. The intent of this four year (2014-2018) program is to improve knowledge of the marine environments in the Darwin and Bynoe Harbour regions by collating and collecting baseline data that enable the creation of thematic habitat maps that underpin marine resource management decisions. The specific objectives of the survey were to:\n \n1.\tObtain high resolution geophysical (bathymetry) data for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay;\n2.\tCharacterise substrates (acoustic backscatter properties, grainsize, sediment chemistry) for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay; and \n3.\tCollect tidal data for the survey area.\n\nData acquired during the survey included: multibeam sonar bathymetry and acoustic backscatter; physical samples of seabed sediments, underwater photography and video of grab sample locations and oceanographic information including tidal data and sound velocity profiles. These datasets comprise total sediment metabolism, mineral specific surface area and carbonate and element concetrations, and C and N isotopes of seabed sediments.\n\nA detailed account of the survey is provided in: Siwabessy, P.J.W., Smit, N., Atkinson, I., Dando, N., Harries, S., Howard, F.J.F., Li, J., Nicholas, W.A., Potter, A., Radke, L.C., Tran, M., Williams, D. and Whiteway, T., 2015.
