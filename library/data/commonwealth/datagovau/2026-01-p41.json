The data is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) and spans the year of 2014.\nThis data has been created by the Grattan Institute for the Mapping Australia's Economy: Cities as Engines of Prosperity Report, Kelly, J-F., Donegan, P., Chisholm, C., &amp; Oberklaid, M. published 20 July 2014. The report maps the Australian economy by the location of economic activity, defined as the dollar value of goods and services produced by workers within a particular area. It finds that economic activity is concentrated most heavily in the central business districts (CBDs) and inner areas of large cities.\nFor more information including the data creation methodology, please refer to the Mapping Australia's Economy: Cities as Engines of Prosperity Report.\nPlease note:\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the ASGS 2011 SA2 Digital Boundaries.\n",

    "title": "Native Vegetation Management Benefits - Series 2",
    "description": "Native Vegetation Management Benefits (NVMB) mapping\n\nNVMB mapping is a way of identifying the relative benefits to NSW biodiversity of protecting or restoring native vegetation. NVMB mapping is used for cross-tenure, whole-of-landscape conservation planning, decision support, prioritisation and scenario planning.\n\nThe NVMB method employs well-developed ecological theory to combine vascular plant records, bioclimatic data, vegetation condition mapping and connectivity analysis. \n\nNVMB Series 2\n\nSeries 2 is a fully complementary set of NVMB layers with consistent units (with a range from zero to one), such that for any location, the set of benefit values across the set of NVMB layers sum to a single maximum level of overall potential benefit for that location, referred to as the 'Maximum Biodiversity Benefit' (MBB). MBB reflects each location's capacity to support species and communities which have been depleted across NSW. The schema describing the nesting of the set of layers is provided in the attached resource: <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-benefits-series-2/resource/b3ba42d1-318e-4c6e-995b-ab8181049293\">NVMB Series2 chart</a>. Two 'delta' (change) layers are included to represent what additional benefits can be achieved in 15 years of fostering regeneration (delta improve benefits) and through full restoration action (delta restore benefits). A 'manage and improve' layer quantifies the combined benefits conserved by managing existing vegetation, and the additional benefits that can accrue through fostering regeneration (over a nominal 15-year period). \n\nAll layers are derived from a common set of inputs. The various NVMB layers become differentiated through the application of variants of the <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/ecological-condition-of-terrestrial-habitat\">ecological condition</a> layer, at the final stage of developing the layers (current condition is used for manage benefits, partially restored condition for improve benefits, and fully restored condition for the restoration benefits).\n\nSeries 2 represents a slight but significant departure from previous NVMB versions. Previous versions were provided in 4 separate SEED records:  Manage benefits; Improve benefits; Restore benefits; and Landscape benefits. The landscape value benefits from the previous version are now integrated into Manage, Improve and Restoration benefits. A new layer of Maximum Biodiversity Benefit is added.\n\nEnd users will notice significant differences between previous versions and these Series 2 layers. Stage 2 puts greater emphasis on cross-scale ecological connectivity across the benefit layers rather than treating landscape connectivity separately. For example, cleared areas of highly diminished communities such as box-woodlands in the wheat-sheep belt, are only given the highest restore benefit value in areas that are also well connected to areas of existing native vegetation.\n\nVersioning\n\nSeries 2 is an update on the previous NVMB series (Series 1). Users may wish to employ Series 1 in cases where connectivity considerations are less (e.g., for large scale conservation actions - which produce their own 'critical mass'). In most cases Series 2 is the preferred source for conservation planning.\n\nDue to the Series 2 layers forming an integrated set, they are provided together in a single SEED record. Because of the step change from previous version, Series 2 is reset as Series 2 v1.0. \n\nSeries 2 v1.0 is relevant to 2017. It does not consider the 2019-20 megafires or the degree of subsequent recovery. However, 2017 and 2020 NVMB surfaces have been produced in Series 1 (see below for more information).\n\nMore technical detail\n\nThe probabilistic method used for accumulating values draws on the 'equitable' approach (Drielsma and Love 2021) which applies 'diminishing returns' to connectivity, rather than the previous 'any additional unit of connectivity always provides proportionally more benefit'.\n\nThis series also incorporates the following advances:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nuse of continuous values in GDM/environmental space (i.e., no loss of information by unnecessarily reducing to discrete classes)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nby incorporating an improved connectivity links approach (Drielsma et al. 2022), the new layers better consider how different locations can contribute to maintaining or restoring habitat linkages that allow species to move and migrate across landscapes \n</li>\n<li>\n\nincorporation of generic REMP approach (Drielsma and Love 2021) for spatial context component\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nMore information\n\nSeries 1\n\nThe previous series of LVMB mapping can be found at the following SEED records:  <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-manage-benefits9c71e\">Manage benefits</a>; <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-improve-benefitsaaf8c\">Improve benefits</a>;  <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-revegetate-benefits1d347\">Restore benefits</a>; <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-landscape-value-mapping-benefitsbb846\">Landscape benefits</a>.\n\nPost-megafires\n\n2017 and 2020 (post-megafire) NVMB surfaces have been produced in Series 1, for <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm---manage-benefits9c71e\">manage</a> and <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm---revegetate-benefits1d347\">restore</a>. If comparing between 2017 and 2020 be sure to use outputs from the same series (i.e., series 1).\n\nClimate-informed NVMB\n\nClimate-informed versions of the manage benefits and restore benefits (Series 1 v.1) can be found <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/data-packages-for-the-biodiversity-impacts-and-adaptation-project\">here</a>.

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the current *Forest's of Australia (2023)* dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data.**\r\n\r\nForests of Australia (2013) is a continental dataset of forest extent by national forest types. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover spatial datasets, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and Territory agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to the states' and territories' data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nForests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and the Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002. The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

The voyage’s first leg transited from Hobart to Nuku’alofa (10–19 Aug 2025), where science participants boarded. A mid-voyage transfer occurred on 05 Sep, and all science personnel disembarked in Nuku’alofa on 23 Sep before the final transit to Brisbane (23 Sep–1 Oct 2025).\n\nThe gravity meter instrument is a MicroG Lacoste Air-Sea II. Data are stored in .ENV and .DAT data files at CSIRO. There are 52 files totalling 852 MB of raw data in this dataset. Wharf ties were undertaken at Hobart (PW4) and in Brisbane (Grain Corp, Multiuser Terminal) using a Scintrex Autograv CG-5. Wharf tie data can be found in GravityTie_in2025_v05_Hobart_20250807.TXT &amp; GravityTie_in2025_v05_Brisbane_20251001.TXT, which is stored with the raw data.\n\nNo processing has been conducted on this data. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

The data is current as at 31 Dec 2021, includes quarterly snapshots beginning from Dec 2019, and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) 2016.  The geographical boundaries are sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) website.\nThe National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is an independent statutory agency. Their role is to implement the NDIS, which will support a better life for hundreds of thousands of Australians with a significant and permanent disability and their families and carers.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the NDIA.\nPlease note:\n\n\nThe State/Territory groupings are based on the participant's latest residential address.\n\n\nThe availability status of each SA4 is based on the mapping between the SA4, NDIA Service Districts and the bilateral agreements to determine phase-in date for each SA4.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised the participant data.  Participant count values of '&lt;11' have been set to null.",

Here we map Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCE) for PNG using Earth observation data for 2020. This research project aimed to evaluate Living Earth for obtaining consistent and quantified information on blue carbon ecosystem states and dynamics. The objectives focused on evaluating a) the transferability of the existing infrastructure to other big data platforms and to a new geography or ecosystem of interest, namely the tropical coastal environments of Papua New Guinea, and b) the translatability of algorithms for extracting environmental descriptors from EO data between countries and regions and constructing comparable classifications of and uncertainty metrics associated with the mapped land covers and changes. For all coastal regions of Papua New Guinea, and using the CSIRO EASI ASIA ODC instance, classifications and linked descriptions of land cover were successfully generated, with these including BCEs and some terrestrial land covers.

    "title": "New South Wales - National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Map",
    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\nNB This NSW layer is only _NISB.shp, not _NISB_PLUS.shp.",

Area is not the principal basis for determining the predominant use. The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2018-19</em>.

The echosounder's nominal frequency is 12 kHz.\nData are stored in *.all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter at CSIRO. There are 87 files totaling 2.97 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nTide corrections were not applied to the processed data. Processed data had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format, and processed bathymetry and backscatter grids in geotiff format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation.

Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from storm tide inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the storm tide Flood Awareness Map.\n\nStorm tide flooding happens when a storm surge creates higher than normal sea levels. A storm surge can occur due to a low atmospheric pressure meteorological system and/or strong on-shore winds force sea levels to rise above normal levels among other reasons. Flooding can also occur from king tides. King tides occur throughout the year and are higher than normal tides. Low lying parts of Brisbane and the Bayside suburbs may experience storm tide flooding. Tide affected areas of the river, tidal creeks and other waterways may also be affected.\n\nThere are four different storm tide flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe storm tide High likelihood layer consists of the current 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) (2.1mAHD) storm tide flood extent.\n\nThe storm tide Medium likelihood layer consists of the current 1% AEP / 100 year ARI (2.5mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high likelihood area). \n\nThe storm tide Low likelihood layer consists of the 0.2% AEP / 500 year ARI (2.85mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high and medium likelihood areas). \n\nThe storm tide Very Low likelihood consists of the 0.05% AEP / 2000 year ARI (3.2mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high, medium and low likelihood areas).",

    "title": "Australian honey bee industry: 2014-15 survey results",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n ABARES has produced a report containing the results of analysis of beekeeping financial and physical performance data collected from beekeeping businesses in 2015-16. Key performance measures for beekeeping businesses are presented, including analysis of pollination services, use of public lands, challenges facing the beekeeping industry and the extent to which research and information is sought and implemented. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES Australian Honey Bee Industry Survey conducted in 2016. It provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing the current situation of Australian beekeeping businesses, as well as monitoring changes from previous surveys conducted in 2002 and 2008. \r\n\r\n The survey was funded by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, as part of the Australian Government's response to a recommendation from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report from 2014 on the future of the beekeeping and pollination service industries in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Over 13,000 registered beekeepers operate across Australia. The number of commercial beekeepers fell by 25 per cent over the 10 years to 2015-16. \r\n• Most honey produced came from non-agricultural private land (39 per cent) or public land (39 per cent). 23 per cent was produced from agricultural land. Larger businesses were more likely to derive a greater proportion of total honey produced from public land. \r\n• The majority of beekeeping cash receipts came from honey sales (85 per cent) in 2014-15. Cash receipts from paid pollination were the second largest component of receipts (11 per cent). Business cash income averaged $70 400 and was significantly higher in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. \r\n• Small operators had negative business profit and rate of return in 2014-15, while small-medium, medium and large operators experienced increasingly large positive rates of return and business profit. \r\n• Paid pollination was conducted by around 44 per cent of beekeepers in 2014-15. The proportion of beekeepers and the value of payments received were higher in areas that produced large amounts of bee-pollination dependent crops such as almonds and cherries. \r\n• Drought was the most commonly cited challenge to honey production by beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 (70 per cent of beekeepers). Half of beekeeping businesses indicated that the use of agricultural chemicals negatively impacted floral resources available and thus their honey production. \r\n• The most common disease and pest affecting beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 were chalkbrood and the small hive beetle. The greatest financial impacts were caused by the small hive beetle and American foulbrood. \r\n• Nearly three quarters of beekeeping businesses changed their management practices in 2014-15 as a result of research. Large businesses were more responsive to research findings than smaller operators. \r\n",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the south central section of Jervis Bay between 10/07/90 and 30/08/90. This 'Red' mooring (35.0872 S, 150.7333 E) held three S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately two datasets are missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 6.5m have not been located, as neither have the 10min sample readings for the meter at 10.5m**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This dataset presents regional surface hydrological in-land waterbodies in Australia as polygons which describe the area of the body of water at a higher resolution than that of the national dataset.  \nThe following features are included in this dataset:Canal Area - An artificial open channel which provides the supply, distribution or removal of water for irrigation purposes, or for a significant infrastructure function (such as salt interception, land reclamation, or drainage between water features for environmental management purposes). Estuary - The part of the mouth or lower course of a river in which its current meets the sea's tides, and is subject to their effects. Swimming Pool - An artificial body of water intended for swimming or water-based recreation, situated either above or in-ground. Flood Irrigation Storage - A body of water collected and stored behind constructed barriers, for the specific use of flooding pastures via internal irrigation systems. Town Water Storage - A body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier for some specific use (with the exception of Flood Irrigation Storage). Town Water Storage are bodies of water primarily stored for the consumption of urban, semi urban and rural township populations. The water is treated post storage by government, or private authorities, and connected to government regulated water networks. Rural Water Storage - A body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier for some specific use. Rural Water Storage are bodies of water stored for rural farming and agricultural practices (with the exception of Flood Irrigation Storage) and/or for the consumption of the associated land owners. The water is not treated by government authorities or connected to government regulated water networks. Lake - A naturally occurring body of mainly static water surrounded by land. Watercourse Area - A natural channel along which water may flow from time to time. Aquaculture Area - Shallow beds, usually segmented by constructed walls, for the use of aquaculture. Salt Evaporator - A flat area, usually segmented, used for the commercial production of salt by evaporation. Settling Pond - Shallow beds, usually segmented by constructed walls, for the treatment of sewage or other wastes. Swamp - Land which is so saturated with water that it is not suitable for agricultural or pastoral use and presents a barrier to free passage. Marine Swamp - That low lying part of the backshore area of tidal waters, usually immediately behind saline coastal flat, which maintains a high salt water content, and is covered with characteristic thick grasses and reed growths. Foreshore Flat - That part of the seabed or estuarine areas, between mean high water and the line of lowest astronomical tide. Saline Coastal Flat - That nearly level tract of land between mean high water and the line of the highest astronomical tide.Land Subject to Inundation - Low lying land usually adjacent to lakes or watercourses, which is regularly covered with flood water for short periods.\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-03-12\n",

You must not set down or pick up passengers in clearways, even when stopped at traffic lights or in traffic.\n\nClearways are also tow away zones. Any vehicle parked in a clearway will be towed as soon as possible. Towed vehicles will also be issued with a parking fine.\n\nSome clearway areas operate only during certain times of the day. The clearway sign will show the times of operation. If there are no times on the sign, the clearway applies 24 hours a day.\n\nAdditional information on parking can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/parking-in-brisbane\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.

    "description": "Coastal compartments are structural features relating to geological features and landforms that can be used to provide a framework for planning and management of the coastline. The primary compartment boundaries for WA were determined by identifying major changes in rock type along the coast and changes in shoreline orientation, while incorporating complete landforms of coastal significance. The primary compartments have then been subdivided to produce secondary and tertiary compartments. This dataset was commissioned by the Department of Planning and compiled by Damara Pty Ltd and the Geological Society of WA. A full report was also prepared to accompany the dataset , published August 2011. Some superficial changes have been made to the dataset since publication of the report in order to amalgamate the data into a nationwide compartment dataset developed by Geoscience Australia.",

The base data used for the capture is the cadastre. The Suburbs layer is a data set that reflects the official boundaries of addressable localities in South Australia as defined by the Geographical Names Act, 1991. The polygons are based on the existing cadastral, topographic or road centerline data that defines the underlying features that boundaries follow.\nThe Suburb Boundaries in the urban and rural areas are updated when required through notification in the Government Gazette or spatial improvement of the cadastre. The capturing started 1990 and is ongoing. The Suburb boundary dataset is currently 100% complete for the state and complies with government classification standards.\nFor more information please visit the South Australian Government Data Portal.",

Fully immunised means a child has received the scheduled vaccinations according to age for hepatitis B (hepB); diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (DTPa); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); polio (IPV); pneumococcal, meningococcal C, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), and varicella. The data spans the years of 2012-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data was sourced from the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), which is administered by the Australian Government Department of Human Services. The AIR is a national register that records immunisations given to children to help parents and guardians keep track of their children’s immunisations.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Immunisation rates for children in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe AIR may underestimate coverage due to incomplete submission of immunisation records or the inclusion of children who no longer reside in an area but have not been updated on the register.\n\n\nChildren identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander in this report reflect the indigenous status recorded on the AIR, which is based on Medicare enrolment records.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"NP\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nRows assigned a \"#\" in the \"Interpret with Caution\" column should be interpreted with caution as these area’s eligible population is between 26 and 100 registered children.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2011 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Median rents represent the midpoint in the distribution of all rents. Fifty per cent of rents are higher than the median and fifty per cent are below the median.\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA).

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of criminal incidents by principal offence recorded on the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP). A recorded criminal incident is a criminal event that may include multiple offences, alleged offenders and/or victims that is recorded on the LEAP database on a single date and at one location. The data spans the years ending March in the period of 2010 to 2019 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe CSA recorded crime collection includes all offences that are reported to, and detected by, Victoria Police and recorded on the LEAP database. The scope and coverage of the data, however, is not representative of all crime that occurs in Victoria. Some crimes may not be recorded on LEAP, not be reported to police, or the responsibility for responding to certain offences may lie with another agency. Recorded criminal incident data are compiled on the basis of the date that the incident was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the incident was detected by, or reported to police. The creation date may not be the date when the incident occurred, or the date when the incident came to the attention of police.\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRecorded crime statistics are based on data extracted by Victoria police on the 18th day after the reference period, and are subject to movement between releases.\n\n\nThe criminal incidents in the dataset are grouped according to the CSA offence classification.\n\n\nThe data excludes criminal incidents recorded at Justice institutions and immigration facilities, Unincorporated Victoria and where the geographic location is unknown or outside of Victoria.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, sensitive criminal incident counts for subdivisions 'A10 Homicide and related offences' and 'A30 Sexual offences' with a value of 1 to 3 are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n",

It is a summary measure of the ongoing sustainability of operations. It excludes gains and losses resulting from changes in price levels and other changes in the volume of assets. It is the component of the change in net worth that is due to transactions and can be attributed directly to government policies.\nThe general government sector comprises all government departments, offices and other bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. General government services include those which are mainly non-market in nature, those which are largely for collective consumption by the community and those which involve the transfer or redistribution of income.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nPolygon shapefiles of the component inputs to the South Sydney Basin subregion Prelimnary Assessment Extent (PAE). The Preliminary Assessment Extent (PAE) has been derived from the maximum extents of the input surface water PAE and A 20km buffer around the mine point locations for the South Sydney Basin subregion. These are the shapefiles that represent these component extents.\n\n\n\nFor more information on developing PAEs see M02 Compiling water-dependent assets at http://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/submethodology.shtml\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe final PAE  is the result of a UNION (ArcGIS function) of the following polygon areas. This dataset contains the inputs of the UNION as follows:\n\n\n\nA:\n\n\n\nA 20km buffer around the mine point locations for\n\n\n\nAirly (underground)\n\nAngus Place -(underground)\n\nAppin (underground)\n\nClarence (underground)\n\nCullen Valley (underground)\n\nDendrobium (underground)\n\nInvincible (open cut)\n\nPine Dale (open cut)\n\nRussell Vale (underground)\n\nSpringvale (underground)\n\nTahmoor (underground)\n\nWest Cliffe (underground)\n\nWongawilli (underground)\n\n\n\nthat has been clipped to the Sydney Basin bioregion boundary.\n\n\n\nand;\n\n\n\nB: \n\n\n\nA 500m buffer around selected 1:250k Topo streamlines flowing out of the underground mine areas, they being\n\n\n\nAngus Place - (Wolgan River)\n\nAirly - (unnamed)\n\nCullen Valley (unnamed)\n\nSpringvale - (unnamed)\n\nClarence - (Wallangambe River)\n\nAppin/West Cliffe - (Georges River)\n\nDendrobium - (Cordeaux River)\n\nRussell Vale (Cataract River)\n\nTahmoor - (unnamed)\n\nWongawilli - (unnamed)\n\n\n\nThe 20km mine buffer takes in most of the buffered stream areas with the exception of the eastern most sections of the Wolgan and Warrangambe, thus resulting in the snakelike extrusions in the north eastern part of the PAE shapefile and another extending northwest from Cullen Valley beyond the bioregion boundary.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) SSB Preliminary Assessment Extent inputs v01.

The data at any given time is a combination of information provided from a number of original sources up to 2015, some administrative maintenance, and edits provided through self-management.\nThe original data was collected by Dr Darren Phillips and published in 1996 in paper form. There were various state and city lists maintained as HTML lists by Russ Grayson and Fiona Campbell on the ACFCGN website from 2004-2014. During this period other partial directories were created, including the Tasmanian inventory of school Gardens (~2008), the South Australian Eat Well program (~2010), and the listings of Cultivating Community in the Melbourne area (~2011). These and other lists were combined for the first time in a single database in 2012 by John Brisbin. In 2018 ACFCGN was offered support from AURIN (Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network) to upgrade the database and annual survey to allow for better access by academics and other researchers.\nFor further information please contact data@communitygarden.org.au (+61 407 471 565)",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "A 6m galvanized pole has been deployed in the eastern part of the lagoon in behind Seabird Islet. \n\nThe Relay Pole has three functions. The first is to propagate the wireless network through which the buoys talk and so it forms part of the network backbone talking directly to Relay-Pole 1. The second function is that a vaisala WXT520 weather station is mounted on the top and so this pole provides above water met observations. These include air temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction and rainfall.\n\nThe third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex.\n\nThe pole has two Campbell Scientific loggers (one for the weather station, one for the sensors), spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station). The sensor string as of August 2010 has a SeaBird SBE37 at the end of the sensor string (around 230m out from the pole), and two SeaBird SBE39's located at teh reef crest and down at the start of the reef slope.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

This dataset only shows the classifications and trends from the 2004 and 2008 assessment. \n\nThe Assessment focused on colour, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total dissolved salts, total suspended solids and turbidity. A total of 255 sites from 23 basins in Western Australia (out of a total of 44) were included in the 2008 update with 126 of these being assessed for the first time in 2008. In 2004 232 sites were assessed. Due to a lack of data numerous sites that were assessed in 2004 are not included in the 2008 update. Many basins had no data, whilst the others lacked recent monitoring data. The status and trend results were compiled into an excel spreadsheet.\n\nDataset was formerly known as Statewide River Water Quality Assessment (DOW-056)",

    "description": "This web service contains sediment and geochemistry information for the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in the Timor Sea collected by Geoscience Australia during September and October 2012 on RV Solander (survey GA0339/SOL5650).  Further information on the survey is available in the post-survey report published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L., Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A.\nSurvey SOL5650/GA0339 was undertaken between 12 September and 6 October 2012, using the AIMS 35 m research vessel Solander with a science and technical support crew from AIMS, Geoscience Australia, University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. The survey comprised a series of geophysical mapping and biophysical sampling activities in four areas within the Oceanic Shoals CMR. In each survey area, multibeam sonar data (bathymetry and backscatter) was collected to provide 100% spatial coverage, with sampling stations selected before the survey. Site selection used a spatially-balanced random stratified method (termed a Generalised Random-Tessellation Stratified [GRTS] design), that was weighted to shallow areas (<50 m water depth). Sampling included non-destructive techniques (towed underwater video, stills photography, baited underwater video) to record benthic and pelagic biota, plus physical sampling of sediments and epibenthic biota (grabs, benthic sled tows). Water column measurements (conductivity, temperature, turbidity) and sea surface samples were also taken at representative stations and during transits. To broadly characterise the sub-surface geology, shallow (<70 m) sub-surface data was collected across three of the survey areas with a sub-bottom profiler.\nSampling was undertaken at 70 stations across the four survey areas to characterise the geophysical and biological properties of the seabed and water column within each area; with sea surface samples collected at a further nine stations during transits. At each station, the type of sampling undertaken and the gear used was determined by the seabed composition, water depth and visibility. In particular, deployment of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) was limited to water depths less than ~60 m due to high turbidity and low light conditions. \nSampling activities within the four survey areas included:\nTowed underwater video transects at 52 stations to characterise seabed types and benthic communities;\nCollection of replicate sediment samples at 61 stations for sedimentology, geochemistry and infauna analyses using either a Smith-McIntyre grab (29 stations) or a box corer (32 stations);\nBenthic sled tows at 22 stations to sample epibenthos;\nDeployment of BRUVS at 56 stations to characterise demersal fish communities;\nDeployment of Stereo Imagery System for Shark and Tuna Assessments (SISSTAs) units at 120 stations to characterise pelagic fish communities;\nDeployment of a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) instrument at 63 stations to characterise water column properties, and; \nDeployment of 10 ocean drifters to map surface ocean currents in the region.\nA link to the post-survey report is available here: http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/76658/Rec2013_038.pdf\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset shows the footprints of all structures within the City of Melbourne. A building footprint is a 2D polygon (or multi-polygon) representation of the base of a building or structure. The footprint is defined as the boundary of the structure where the walls intersect with the ground plane or podium, rather than an outline of the roof area (roofprint).\n\nWhere a building has a significant change in built form, multiple footprint polygons are ‘stacked’ vertically to define shape of the built form. This includes, and is not limited to:\n\n- Tower\n- Podium\n- Setbacks/offsets\n\nThe Australian Height Datum (AHD) is the national vertical datum for Australia. The National Mapping Council adopted the AHD in May 1971 as the datum to which all vertical control mapping would be referred\n\nThe data was captured in May 2023.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory.

This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions.

    "description": "The Cashless Debit Card (CDC) program has ended in all locations across Australia, and all CDC participants have now exited the program or transferred to enhanced Income Management. Data summaries for the CDC program by month include the below tables:\r\n\r\nTable 1. Number of CDC participants by original CDC location, Income Support Payment and if a participant had identified as an Indigenous Australian.\r\n\r\nTable 2. Community panel (or body) decisions to change the restricted portion of welfare payment.\r\n\r\nTable 3. When someone was not subject to cashless welfare arrangements: Well-being exemptions.\r\n\r\nTable 4. When someone was not subject to cashless welfare arrangements: Exits.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about the CDC:\r\n\r\nOn 6 March 2023, CDC participants located in the Northern Territory, Cape York and Doomadgee region, as well as volunteers from the Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions, moved to enhanced Income Management. More information about enhanced Income Management is located on the Department of Social Services (the department) web site: https://www.dss.gov.au/families-and-children/programmes-services/welfare-conditionality/enhanced-income-management-overview \r\n\r\nThe CDC program was repealed on 30 March 2023, by the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Act 2022, which is located here: https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2022A00039.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocations and commencement dates:\r\n\r\nLocation: Ceduna region, South Australia \r\n\r\nCommencement date: 15 March 2016\r\n\r\nIncluded: Ceduna, Koonibba, Scotdesco, Yalata and Oak Valley \r\n\r\nCohort: All people on a working age income support payment\r\n\r\nLocation: East Kimberley region, Western Australia\r\n\r\nCommencement date: 26 April 2016\r\n\r\nIncluded: Kununurra and Wyndham \r\n\r\nCohort: All people on a working age income support payment\r\n\r\nLocation: Goldfields region, Western Australia \r\n\r\nCommencement date: 26 March 2018\r\n\r\nIncluded: Kalgoorlie, Boulder, Coolgardie, Laverton, Leinster, Leonora, Menzies and Kookynie.\r\n\r\nCohort: All people on a working age income support payment\r\n\r\nLocation: Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region, Queensland\r\n\r\nCommencement date: 21 September 2018\r\n\r\nIncluded: Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Aldershot, Bargara, Elliott Heads, Woodgate, Booyal, Burrum Heads, Torbanlea, Toogoom, Howard, Childers, Burnett Heads and River Heads.\r\n\r\nCohort: All people aged 35 years and under who received Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance (Job seeker), Parenting Payment (Single) or Parenting Payment (Partnered).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Confidentialisation Policy: Table cells are suppressed where the count refers to less than five, but more than zero, people.\r\n\r\nThe method is:\r\n\r\n•\tCells with counts between one (1) and four (4) are presented as <5.\r\n\r\n•\tCells with a count of zero (0) are not suppressed.\r\n\r\n•\tWhere suppression has been applied and it is still possible to derive the cell value from other information in the table, the total/s or the next lowest aggregate cells are suppressed and presented with ‘n.p.’ (not provided).\r\n\r\n\r\nData caveats: If a person was on the CDC program and moved out of a CDC area, they remained on the program and were reported against their original CDC community.\r\n",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The physical climate defines a significant portion of the habitats in which biological communities and species reside. It is important to quantify these environmental conditions, and how they have changed, as this will inform future efforts to study many natural systems. We present the results of a statistical  summary of the variability in sea surface temperature (SST) time-series data for the waters surrounding Australia, from 1993 to 2013. We partition variation in the SST series into annual trends, inter-annual trends, and a number of components of random variation. We utilise satellite data and validate the statistical summary from these data to summaries of data from long-term monitoringstations and from the global drifter program. The spatially dense results show clear trends that associate with oceanographic features. Noteworthy oceanographic features include: average warming was greatest off southern West Australia and off eastern Tasmania where the warming was around 0.6 C per decade for a twenty year study period, and; insubstantial warming in areas dominated by the East Australian Current but this area did exhibit high levels of inter-annual variability (long-term trend increases and decreases but does not increase on average). The results of the analyses can be directly incorporated into (biogeographic) models that explain variation in biological data where both biological and environmental data are on a fine scale.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Queensland fruit fly model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

The tests were designed to provide an upper bound estimates of geogenic chemical mobilisation from shale gas formations in the Isa Superbasin and is intended to guide future field based monitoring, management, and treatment options.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nLeachate tests were conducted at 80 degC (inorganics) in order to examine elevated temperature conditions that could be present during hydraulic fracturing operations at deep shale gas operations (median aquifer temperature at 1000-2500 m drill hole ~ 80 degC; after removal of unknown, uncorrected, and unidentified data and methodologies in the dataset) (https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/70604). Exploratory studies were also conducted on the effect of pressure (inorganics) that would be present in wells of shale gas operations on geogenic chemical (element) mobilisation into solution from powdered rock samples.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>cherry</strong> model in the Horticulture and Viticulture node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "Aggregated metadata on environmental monitoring and observing activities from three Australian national research infrastructures (NRIs): biodiversity survey events from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/), marine observations collected by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and site-based monitoring and survey efforts by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/). This dataset provides a summary breakdown of these efforts by survey topic, region and time period from 2010 to the present.\nSurvey topics are mapped to an EcoAssets Earth Science Features vocabulary based on the Earth Science keywords from the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD, https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/KeywordViewer/) vocabulary, modified to use taxonomic concept URIs from the Australian National Species List (ANSL, https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/) in place of the GCMD Earth Science &gt; Biological Classification vocabulary. ANSL categories map more readily to biodiversity survey categories, since GCMD depends on a top-level division between vertebrates and invertebrates rather than offering an animal category. The EcoAssets Earth Science Features vocabulary, including alternative keywords used in ALA, IMOS or TERN datasets, can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.26197/w2a2-6s86.\nTo find out more about this dataset visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/aggregated-data-environmental-monitoring-and-observations-effort/",

Data are sourced primarily from government gazette notices, cadastral maps and plans. A nominal scale of around 1:5 million and a minimum 50 square kilometre threshold limit for land parcels was used in the generalisation of this product from the National Public and Aboriginal Lands data. Data is suitable for GIS applications. This map shows public and private land tenure, including Indigenous land for the whole of Australia at a scale of 1:4.7 million.\nThe land tenure boundaries depicted on this map generally define broadly classified areas greater than 50 square kilometres. Indigenous land areas between 0.1 and 100 square kilometres are shown more comprehensively by symbols. The information on this map is complemented by statistical tables giving the total area of the land tenure categories for each State and Territory.\nThis map is also available as free vector GIS data, ArcInfo Export, ArcView Shapefile and MapInfo mid/mif.

    "description": "These data are derived from returns submitted by corporations registered as Category ‘Other’ under the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_. Category ‘Other’ includes corporations formerly registered as Category F (Finance Companies), G (General Financiers) and E (Pastoral Finance Companies) under the _Financial Corporations Act 1974_. Along with Category D (Money Market Corporations), these corporations are known collectively as Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs).\r\n\r\nIn April 2003, responsibility for the collection of financial statistics from Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) was transferred to APRA. Previously, these data were collected by the RBA under the now repealed Financial Corporations Act 1974. The introduction of new reporting forms in April 2003 has led to some significant breaks in series and affected definitions and categories shown for these institutions. There are other breaks from time to time in the historical data due to changes in the number of reporting corporations. Details of data reported by individual corporations are confidential.\r\n\r\nSince December 1999, the collections cover RFCs whose assets in Australia (including related corporations) exceed $50 million. Prior to December 1999, this threshold was set at $5 million. This change resulted in breaks in all series covering RFCs.\r\n\r\nThe collection of statistics from the authorised money market dealers (formerly Category C corporations under the Financial Corporations Act 1974) ceased from August 1996.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, the data are derived from RRF 320.0: Statement of Financial Position collected by APRA. Prior to April 2003, the data were derived from the FCA forms: D1, E1, F1 and G1 which were collected by the RBA.\r\n\r\n‘AFIs’ refers to banks, credit unions, building societies, SCCIs, RFCs and the RBA.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Cash and liquid assets – Cash and balances with AFIs’ includes cash and deposits and placements with AFIs. Prior to April 2003, this series includes cash and deposits and placements with banks and RFCs.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Cash and liquid assets – Other’ includes gold bullion and deposits and placements with clearing houses and other (non-AFI) financial institutions. Prior to April 2003, this series includes deposits and placements with all institutions other than banks and RFCs. This series also includes placements with authorised money market dealers prior to August 1996.\r\n\r\n‘Trading and investment securities – Debt’ includes commercial paper and promissory notes, bills of exchange and all other debt securities held by all counterparties.\r\n\r\n‘Loans and advances – Household’ includes housing and other personal loans to households, and excludes finance lease receivables.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Loans and advances – Business’ includes loans to the following counterparties: private trading corporations, private unincorporated businesses, public non-financial corporations, community service organisations and other (non-AFI) financial institutions. Prior to April 2003, this series includes loans to all counterparties other than households and RFCs, and also includes bills of exchange accepted by the reporting corporation. This series excludes finance lease receivables.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Loans and advances – AFIs’ includes loans to AFIs. Prior to April 2003, this series only includes loans to RFCs (loans to other AFIs are included in ‘Loans and advances – Business’). This series excludes finance lease receivables.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Borrowings from residents – Borrowings from AFIs’ includes deposits and placements due to AFIs and short-term loans from ADIs. Prior to April 2003, this series includes borrowings from banks and related RFCs.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Borrowings from residents – Deposits and placements’ includes deposits and placements due to the following counterparties: private trading corporations, private unincorporated businesses, public non-financial corporations, community service organisations and other (non-AFI) financial institutions.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Borrowings from residents – Other’ includes borrowings by the issue of promissory notes, bills of exchange and other debt securities, short-term loans from non-ADIs and all long-term loans. Prior to April 2003, this series includes borrowings from all counterparties other than banks and related RFCs, and borrowings by the issue of promissory notes, debentures, unsecured notes and bills of exchange accepted by banks.\r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This data was collected in February 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R4.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart, Australia, February 19, 2013\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, February 25, 2013\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "MeerKAT has already discovered a number of Galactic transients, which are most likely to be Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs). Previous observations of a few of these sources with the Parkes UWL receiver have proven its utility in follow-up timing observations of MeerKAT discoveries.\n  MeerKAT has discovered a few more RRATs in its latest observing cycle and more good quality UWL observations of these sources are required to determine the rotational period and period derivative and also to facilitate the study of their emission properties. Therefore, we request follow-up observations of 5 new sources to achieve this and to further enable spectral and polarization studies of these sources. Given the potential link between RRATs, magnetars, and some fast radio bursts (FRBs) suggested by both observations and theories, this study could reveal more similarities between these different classes of transient sources and significantly advance our understanding of their origins.",

The results also help us monitor our Council Plan and guide policy, planning and management to ensure that Melbourne continues to be a liveable, bold, inspirational and sustainable city.\nA visual representation of the indicators presented here can be found in our online visualisation. The indicators are from a select list we collect for the following two main activities: \n1. The City of Melbourne Social Indicator Survey (CoMSIS) provides insight into the health, wellbeing, participation and connection of residents in our city. This data is collected to directly address some of the Council Plan’s municipal outcome indicators and support our health and wellbeing priorities. Findings of the survey give insight into the perceived quality of life for our residents.\n2. The World Council on City Data (WCCD) is a network of cities committed to improving services and quality of life with open city data and standardised urban indicators. The WCCD developed and oversees an international standard for city data: ISO 37120 Sustainable Development of Communities: Indicators for City Services and Quality of Life. The City of Melbourne is a member of this network and annually submits indicators for verification in accordance with this standard.\nRelated datasets: Social Indicators for City of Melbourne Residents 2018",

    "description": "The growth history component (WAMSI Node 3.4.1) was to specifically characterise the morphology and growth history of the Ningaloo Reef system, to provide an insight into and predictive capacity for potential and future climatic changes.  \n\nReefs lining the western Exmouth Gulf, located at the northern limit of the 300 km long Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia, represent modern incipient coral reefs and veneers of non reef-building coral/algal communities on exposed Pleistocene or ‘give-up’ Holocene reef surfaces. \n\nAcquisition of sixteen cores alongside U-series TIMS dates were used to confirm the nature of the Pleistocene foundation and characterise Holocene reef development. Three calcretised Pleistocene units were identified as:\n1) the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e) reef directly underlying Holocene units, \n2) a mid-Pleistocene (MIS 7?) bioclastic conglomerate unit, and \n3) a Pleistocene alluvial fanglomerate. \n\nEight Holocene reef facies (total thickness of 1.8-5.3 m) included coral framework facies (domal, arborescent, mixed, tabulate and encrusting) and detrital facies (carbonate sand, skeletal rubble and alluvial fan deposits). Holocene ages range from 7.93-5.8 ka BP with vertical accretion ranging from 1.46-9.88 mm/yr (avg. 4.11 mm/yr). Highest rates of accretion and thickest accumulation occurred in the most seaward and deepest cores composed of massive coral framestone and coralline algal crusts. \n\nA six stage Holocene chronology is proposed, including: \n1) coastal inundation from 8-8.5 ka BP, \n2) initiation ‘start-up’ from 8-7.5 ka BP, \n3) rapid growth ‘catch-up’ and back-step from 7.5-7 ka BP, \n4) rapid aggradational growth ‘catch-up’ from 7-6.5 ka BP, \n5) reef decline ‘give-up’ and detrital buildup from 6.5-5.8 ka BP, and \n6) detrital buildup and progradation from 5.8 ka BP to present. \n\nChanges in reef facies and the ultimate demise of the Holocene reef probably involved a combination of increased sea-level, coastal flooding and erosion during the mid-Holocene highstand, with associated increase in sedimentation, turbidity and decline in water quality; burial by sediment buildup during the mid-Holocene highstand and detrital progradation during the mid- to late-Holocene regression; and, the introduction of alluvial sediment during cyclones and other severe storms to an already stressed community. Modern communities have thus shifted from coral-dominated to bored macroalgal pavements. \n\nThis study shows that integration of reef development processes with response to environmental change can be used to assess future pressures on coral reef ecosystems globally.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "<b>Version Oct 2021</b>\nThe Strategic Framework Place Types is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.Planning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate).  For more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of helpful information sheets or contact Council.  The attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Further details on the Qld Planning Provisions can be found <a href=\"https://dilgpprd.blob.core.windows.net/general/qpp-4-0.pdf\">here</a>.",

RFMPs for 2019–24 will be prepared during the life of the SBMP.\nThe ACT Emergency Services Commissioner (the Commissioner) is responsible for approval of RFMPs. They will be reviewed as required to reflect significant changes. These may include unplanned bushfires, which may provide strategic advantages or changes to the location or extent of assets – for example, the development of new estates.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nThe ACT Government is providing this bushfire management map for information purposes only.

Over 300,000 global Multi-Channel Sea Surface Temperature (MCSST) retrievals are generated and distributed daily in less than 5 hours from the time the satellites acquire the data. Global match-ups of satellite retrievals with drifting buoy measurements of sea surface temperature consistently maintain a global root-mean-square difference error of less than 0.7 oC. \n\nFor more information about NAVOCEANO, as well as for links to the data, visit its separate metadata record [http://gcmd.nasa.gov/records/GCMD_NAVOCEANO_MCSST.html].\n\nNB: The Naval Oceanographic Office's global 10 km SST analysis is now available in L4 netcdf format (GDS Version 1 Revision 1.7) on the JPL GDAC. \n\nIt is updated daily with the NAVOCEANO operational N-18, N-17, MetOp, and GOES West SSTs, the Remote Sensing Systems orbital AMSRE SSTs, and the JPL 9km climatology. \n\nPlease contact bruce.mckenzie@navy.mil with any questions about the data.",

    "description": "Evaluation of native fish diversity, condition, reproduction and recruitment contribute to understanding the benefit of environmental water and to the biodiversity outcomes sought by the Basin Plan. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project examined the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and assisted the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nFish data was collected over the duration of the LTIM Project from 2014-15 to 2018-19 in all Selected Areas*, including: fish catch, individual length and weight, egg and larval catch, and estimated age of a small subset of individuals. \r\n\r\n*Due to the use of different methods to collect data in the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers Selected Area, this data has been excluded from the Basin scale analysis (however fish general outcomes are reported). \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Fish Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We thank them for their knowledge and science and respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n",
