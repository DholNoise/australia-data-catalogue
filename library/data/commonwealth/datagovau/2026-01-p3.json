    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "title": "Victorian Alpine Resorts - Daily Snow Depth Records Mount Buller",
    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTskin L3S product for 1 month of consecutive night-time periods, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 1 month average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

Young anemometer and YSI barometer was set up near Governor Head, Jervis Bay (35.133S, 150.762E). The site was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nBetween 2nd November 1988 and 3rd November 1989 the station recorded wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure. \n\nThe Meteorological Station recorded 10 minute vector averages of the wind velocity and 10 minute values of air pressure. Data is presented in the oceanographic format i.e. 'direction going to'. The datasets titled 'Additional meteorological data' provide information on the average wind speed and direction, as well as the maximum gusts.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "The Australian water markets report 2014-15 presents detailed information on water markets for the 2014-15 financial year, including statistics on water access entitlement and water allocation trade, market performance (trade processing times), entitlements on issue and environmental water. These statistics are presented nationally, for the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), and by state for systems outside the sMDB. \r\n\r\n Accompanying the report is a database of water trades from 2007-08 to 2014-15, and a spreadsheet containing the data underlying all report figures and commonly requested statistics. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n In 2014-15, Australian water access entitlement trade and water allocation trade totalled 1796 GL and 5784 GL respectively. For water access entitlement trade, this was a decrease of 614 GL or 34 per cent compared to 2013-14, largely reflecting a decrease in Commonwealth environmental water recovery. For water allocation trade, this was an increase of 243 GL or 4 per cent compared to 2013-14. The Murray-Darling Basin accounted for 81 per cent of national water access entitlement trade and 94 per cent of national water allocation trade, after excluding 2172 GL of environmental transfers in the sMDB. \r\n\r\n The 2014-15 water year was characterised by below-average rainfall, runoff and streamflow in Australia. Storage volumes declined significantly, from 70 per cent to 59 per cent nationally. This continued a trend of declining storage volumes since the flood events of 2011 and 2012. The poor seasonal conditions resulted in water allocation percentages in major water markets being generally lower in 2014-15 than in 2013-14, driving increases in water allocation and entitlement prices in most water systems. \r\n\r\n Historically, there have been few constraints on trade between regions and trading zones within the major sMDB market, leading to fairly consistent water prices between regions. However, in recent seasons, trade restrictions have become more important, with changes in trade flows, the introduction of new limits and the reintroduction of previously suspended limits. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15, just 52 GL of water was recovered by the Commonwealth, predominantly through infrastructure. Around 5 GL of entitlements were purchased in 2014-15, mainly from the northern MDB. ",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts. A comprehensive description of the methodology and outcomes is available in this report.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

The data covers migrating settlers with a Date of Settlement between 01/07/2019 and 30/06/2020. The location data is aggregated based on the Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries of the 2011 Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC).\nThe data in this dataset are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit Data.gov.au.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data with the 2011 LGA boundaries of the ABS Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC). Where the recorded number of settlers is not provided (\"n.p.\" in the original table) the data has been set to null, and if the number is less than 5 (\"&lt;5\" in the original table) for confidentiality, it has been set to 4.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the south central section of Jervis Bay between 12/09/90 and 30/10/90. This 'Red' mooring (35.0895 S, 150.735 E) held three S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection. The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 10.5m have not been located and can therefore not be provided through this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "title": "Parent record: Flow patterns within Jervis Bay: Winter deployment of current meters",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe second of these six experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay during the winter months, when the waters are only weakly thermally stratified. This winter mooring program was run as two deployments of current meters, from 10th July to 30th August and from 12th September to 30th October 1990, along with a meteorological station measuring winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head. [Given that this meteorological data bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.] \n\nTwo moorings were maintained with each deployment. In the first deployment (10/7/90 - 30/8/90) the south-central mooring contained 3 current meters and the northeast mooring 2 current meters. The second deployment (12/9/90 - 30/10/90) repeated the south-central mooring but the northeast mooring was moved south from near Green Point to off Honeymoon Bay.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There are four subsidiary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n6fed5f70-c336-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\na1da6830-c344-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\n45ede7c0-c3d2-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\n0b9e1780-c3d6-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "The Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update 2020 dataset is the national compilation of catchment scale land use data available for Australia (CLUM), as at December 2020. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2018. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. The CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management Classification version 8. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program. Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2008 to 2019) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. Date and scale of mapping are provided in a supporting dataset.\r\n\r\n#What’s new?#\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the December 2018 version: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nThe following areas include some reclassification; the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory, rural residential areas in New South Wales.\t\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. \r\n\r\n#Citation#\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay): \nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Sydney (South) - Haymarket in NSW with SA2 code 117031645, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "The project will determine the status of threatened marine (green, hawksbill and flatback) turtles and dugongs in the Torres Strait and threats to these populations. It also will investigate links between different populations of dugongs and turtles in terms of movement and habitat use. They will also assess the abundance of dugongs in the Torres Strait using aerial surveys.\n\nWorking in conjunction with the Torres Strait Regional Authorities (TSRA) Land and Sea Unit and the TSRA Community Ranger program this project will:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nDetermine the status of green turtles in Torres Strait (sex ratios, patterns of juvenile recruitment, nesting success and hatchling production) using seasonal surveys of green turtle foraging and nesting sites. Foraging sites will vary to cover as many different habitats as possible (e.g. one per year). Nesting sites will include Maizub Kaur (Bramble Cay) and Dowar Island (Mer Group)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDetermine the status of hawksbill and flatback turtles in Torres Strait by conducting Iama community and Mabuiag Community seasonal surveys and trial remote camera deployments at Sassie Island and Malu Kiai (Deliverance Island) to quantify nesting events, which are suspected to be declining, and predation levels, which are speculated to be high. Data will then be used in combination with survey data collected by QDERM (Col Limpus) since 1992, and other life history and mortality data to determine a robust account of population status.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nInvestigate population connectivity of dugong and green turtles using satelite tracking of dugongs caught in the northern section of Torres Strait (i.e. around Biogu), analysis of previous tracking data (from QDERM, CRC TS, MTSRF and AMMC) of turtles and dugongs and collection of skin samples from dugongs and green turtles to strengthen the genetic understanding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nUndertake dugong and turtle aerial surveys in March 2011 and November 2013 of western Torres Strait, including the Dugong Sanctuary and the area west of Orman Reef in association with a parallel survey of the northern GBR. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nAnalyse historical data to examine patterns of turtle abundance in key areas such as western Torres Strait and the Dugong Sanctuary.\n</li>\n</ol>",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for October 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

This dataset replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2018 version 2 released on 26 November 2019. This dataset is the third national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at December 2020. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). The commodities data complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020 dataset (ABARES 2021).\r\n\r\n##What’s new?##\r\nThe following areas have updated mapping since the December 2018 version 2: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nMore detail has been added in the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory (2016).\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUMC datasets in their databases.\r\n\r\n##Citation##\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n The report presents results and analysis from a national survey of Australian sheep and cattle landholders in late 2014, in areas affected by wild dogs. The results are combined with data from a similar 2010 survey to assess longitudinal changes in wild dog impacts and management activities. \r\n\r\n Topics cover landholders' perspectives on wild dog problem severity and distribution, personal and economic impacts and collective management actions. The study also quantifies factors that influence the effectiveness of wild dog management groups and their achievement of outcomes. Around 1010 landholders participated in the 2014 survey. \r\n\r\n This study is the final phase in an ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0305S, 150.756E) between 11/07/90 and 29/08/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\n**Users should be aware that there appears to be some data corruption in the later stages of the datasets collected from 11.5m. In addition to this corruption, the decimated hourly dataset relating to the meter at 5.5m is unfortunately missing**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

To see more information on Environmental offsets visit: <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au:443/ACT-parks-conservation/environmental-offsets\">https://www.environment.act.gov.au/ACT-parks-conservation/environmental-offsets</a>\n<i>Who created the resource?</i>\nThe ACT Parks and Conservation Service (PCS) is the primary land manager of offset sites within the ACT, on behalf of the ACT Government. PCS has collated the environmental offset boundary datasets and continues to curate this dataset. Offset boundaries are established when a proposal by the proponent is accepted by the Commonwealth in accordance with the approval conditions.\n<i>Who was it created for? &amp; why was it created?</i>\nThis layer was created to support PCS with the ongoing management of environmental offsets within the ACT, and to be made publicly available as per the transparency requirements of the EPBC Act's Environmental Offsets Policy, and ACT Government's commitment to transparency.\n<i>When was it created?</i>\nEnvironmental offsets are proposed during the assessment stage of an environmental impact assessment under the EPBC ACT. The final offset boundary may not be agreed until post the approval is granted, and a condition of the approval is triggered. An newly approved offset is added to this dataset within 12 months of approval and offset boundary establishment.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the layers are free from error.",

    "description": "\n\n\nShort description: A network of natural and semi-natural areas which support critical ecosystem services, including connected native species habitats, and which provide for implementation of living infrastructure, active travel, climate adaptation and community wellbeing outcomes. An output of the Connecting Nature, Connecting People program, developed to guide land use and management decisions.\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\nMETHODS\nData collection / creation: The ecological network was initially derived from potential habitat and connectivity model outputs for grassland, woodland and aquatic-riparian ecosystems. These model outputs indicate potential habitat areas, fragmentation and whether a patch is big enough to provide core or corridor habitat functions for specific taxa groups. The network was created by identifying key patches of core habitat and corridors, as well as missing links that could reconnect fragmented patches. These were reviewed by several ecologists until the proposed network was agreed upon.\nThese agreed areas were converted to spatial data. Polygons were drawn around the relevant potential habitat and connectivity model outputs to simplify the data and visualise connections between habitat patches. The output was overlaid over other environmental data, including sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways and many more. Boundaries were adjusted to reflect these values as needed.\nThe ecological network was reviewed by subject matter experts and tested in a draft policy document released for public comment. Further revisions to boundaries were made following feedback. The final layer was dissolved and checked for geometry issues. \nNOTES ON USE\nQuality: The network considers an abundance and variety of datasets, including protected areas, potential habitat and connectivity maps, distribution of sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways, restoration projects, urban open spaces and community sites. Data was sourced from authoritative sources where possible. The network was verified and refined through wide distribution and review of the draft dataset, including by ACT Government ecologists and community members. Where possible, polygon boundaries were drawn around existing features (such as lakes or mapped habitat). Polygons were checked against the most recent aerial imagery to verify values and boundaries. This broad review of existing data and consultation on the output provides confidence the output represents the extent of our collective knowledge and provides a holistic illustration of known values.\nLimitations: The urban ACT Ecological network is a concept only. Polygon boundaries are hand drawn and imprecise. The data has not been ground-truthed. Boundaries should be considered approximate and verified with additional data and ground surveys. Further, the network does not assess feasibility or priorities. It does not consider species presence or absence, habitat condition, management regimes or tenure. This information should be gathered for decision making by referring to other environmental datasets, undertaking ground surveys and consulting with subject matter experts. \nData refinement: The dataset could be further improved by testing corridors against a feasibility ruleset (e.g. distance between core patches, width). Additionally, future research may support a wider range of uses by adopting a more technical approach to establish polygon boundaries or areas of interest. This would support higher spatial accuracy and enable greater certainty on what areas are within the network. A quantitative approach could support spatial statistics to aid decision making, e.g. through the ability to prioritise corridors. The Least-Cost Pathway Method is recommended for further study.\nSHARING\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0623S, 150.7672E) between 13/9/90 and 30/10/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nUsers should be aware that there appears to be some distortion of data within these files. For example, the depth data recorded by the meter maintained around 11.5m produced negative values and also readings of 132m! Salinity readings from the 5.5m current meter are also missing for the start of the record.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 5.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n The first three survey years (2006-07 to 2009-10) were severely affected by drought, with record low inflows to river systems and low irrigation water allocations. Incomes of horticulture, dairy, rice and cotton farms were relatively low throughout this period. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash incomes from 2010-11 onwards were mostly higher than in the first three survey years as seasonal conditions improved and water allocations increased. \r\n\r\n Water trading was an important tool for irrigators to manage low water allocations during severe drought, particularly between 2006-07 and 2008-09. The survey results show the proportion of farms trading water allocations rose from 2006-07 to 2008-09, then declined until 2010-11 as water supplies became more plentiful after the drought ended. ",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2017 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "title": "Genetic management of threatened koala populations: Using genotyping-by-sequencing to define meaningful conservation goals",
    "description": "Genetic management is a critical component of threatened species conservation. Understanding spatial patterns of genetic diversity is essential for evaluating the resilience of fragmented populations to accelerating anthropogenic threats. Nowhere is this more relevant than on the Australian continent, which is experiencing an ongoing loss of biodiversity that exceeds any other developed nation. However, while threatened species management is generally the purview of state governments, intensive data collection at this scale is often neglected, despite arguably being the most useful for guiding ongoing conservation efforts. Using a proprietary genome complexity reduction-based method, we generated a data set of high-quality Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate spatial patterns and indices of genetic diversity in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), a highly specialised folivorous marsupial that is experiencing rapid and widespread population declines across much of its former range. Genotyping of 314 individual koalas sourced from across the state of New South Wales was performed using the Diversity Arrays Technology platform (DArTseq™) with funding provided by the NSW Government under the New South Wales Koala Strategy (Grant Agreement No. KR_2019_01). \nOur findings demonstrate that current management divisions across the state of NSW do not fully represent the distribution of genetic diversity among extant koala populations, and that care must be taken to ensure that translocation paradigms based on these frameworks do not inadvertently restrict gene flow between populations and regions that were historically interconnected. We also recommend that koala populations should be prioritised for conservation action based on the scale and severity of the threatening processes that they are currently faced with, rather than placing too much emphasis on their perceived value (e.g., as reservoirs of potentially adaptive alleles), as our data indicate that existing genetic variation in koalas is primarily partitioned amongst individual animals. As such, the extirpation of koalas from any part of their range represents a potentially critical reduction of genetic diversity for this iconic Australian species.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the long running ABARES  Australian fisheries surveys report. The report presents results from ABARES' fishery surveys on financial returns to fishers and net economic returns from fisheries to the Australian community. The report includes a range of other economic indicators, including productivity analysis. \r\n\r\nThis report covers the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS), and the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector (GHTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with new results for financial years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - has decreased since 2008-09, from $267 000 to $205 000 in 2012-13. In the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector, it has fallen from $200 000 in 2008-09 to $15 000 in 2012-13. This indicator assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, and includes income from all sources. \r\n• Net economic return in the Commonwealth Trawl Sector has declined from $7.3 million in 2010-11 to an estimated $1.4 million in 2013-14. Net economic returns in the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector has declined from $7.2 million to an estimated -$4.4 million in 2013-14. \r\n• The decline in net economic returns in both sectors may suggest that the total allowable catch settings may be misaligned with the Harvest Strategy Policy target of achieving maximum economic yield from the fishery. \r\n",

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTfnd L3S product for a single 72 hour period, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the NOAA AVHRR SSTskin observations, and 0 degC to the Metop and VIIRS SSTsubskin observations, after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (&lt;6 m/s by day and &lt;2 m/s at night). The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 72 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment.aDesignated irrigation\nareasa indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\nThe precise meaning of the term adesignated irrigation areaa varies from\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\nsource material is highly variable and completedness of coverage is poor in\nsome regions.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\n__00211a01.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

This is a land use nomenclature and classification scheme for Australia, ordering land use in a systematic, logical and consistent way. The ALUM Classification has been developed in collaboration with national, state and territory agencies as part of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). \r\n\r\n This document updates Part 2 of the  Guidelines for land use mapping in Australia: principles, procedures and definitions, 4th Edition published by ABARES in 2011. It reflects current needs and experience in classifying land use of national, state and territory agency partners involved in ACLUMP. \r\n\r\n The ALUM Classification has a three-tiered hierarchical structure. Primary, secondary and tertiary classes are broadly structured by the potential degree of modification and the impact on a putative 'natural state' (essentially, a native land cover). The ALUM Classification version 8 includes fields to collect commodity and land management practice information. ",

The workbooks also present leading causes of death by sex for each geographic area.\r\n\r\nThe latest MORT books present data for 2019–2023. MORT books from previous years are available on the [AIHW website](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/mort-books/archived-content). It should be noted that due to changes in geographical boundaries, disease definitions, cause of death data revisions, and revisions in population data over time, data presented in MORT books from previous years may not match that in later releases.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see [Deaths data at AIHW](https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-data/our-data-collections/national-mortality-database/deaths-data) or contact us at deaths@aihw.gov.au.\r\n\r\nAlso available on data.gov.au are the AIHW [General Record of Incidence of Mortality (GRIM) books](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/grim-books).",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof forest and non-forest land over which Indigenous peoples and\r\ncommunities have ownership, management, or rights of use, assembled\r\nfor *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from\r\nmultiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets\r\nrelated to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous\r\nland dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the\r\nForests of Australia (2018) dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies Indigenous land into four categories:\r\n*Indigenous owned and managed: freehold land that is both owned\r\nand managed by Indigenous communities\r\n*Indigenous managed: land that is managed, but not owned, by\r\nIndigenous communities; and lands that are owned by Indigenous\r\npeople but have formal shared management agreements with\r\nAustralia and state and territory government agencies\r\n*Indigenous co-managed: land that is owned and managed by other\r\nparties, but has a formal, legally binding agreement in place that\r\nincludes input from Indigenous people in the process of\r\ndeveloping and implementing a management plan\r\n*Other Special rights: land subject to native title determination,\r\nregistered Indigenous land use agreement, and legislated special\r\ncultural use provision.\r\n\r\nThe *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 6. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\n*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of\r\nnational land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests\r\nReport 2018*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory\r\ngovernment agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then\r\ncombined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of\r\nAustralia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for\r\napplication to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature\r\nconservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved\r\ntenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "    \n\nDefinition: Mean annual dissolved concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil\nwater (mg of nitrogen per kg of water), averaged for both soil layers.\nInterpretation: The dissolved N concentration is calculated as the ratio of\nthe mineral N store to soil water store, which assumes that all the mineral N\nis in solution. Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these\nstores, but not on their ratio. The pattern of mineral N concentrations is\nexplained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N\nstore (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air\ndryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy\nlimitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that\ndecreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-\narid tropical environments. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes (1) current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation; (2) current agricultural inputs of nutrients\n(nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertiliser, legume crops, and legume pastures;\n(3) current nutrient offtakes by product removal (harvest, stock).\nNMnlConc0.Agric a Mean annual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water\n(mgN kgH2O-1) in the aAgrica (present day) scenario NMnlConc0.Base a Mean\nannual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water (mgN kgH2O-1) in the\naBasea (pre-1788) scenario Data is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_cmnswr9cl\n__02811a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The project includes:\n<ul><li>a new web portal to make it easier for the community to report wombats to capture where in the landscape healthy and unhealthy populations of wombats are occurring and so wildlife volunteers can quickly assess treatment options available.(please contact access Canberra for wildlife injured on our roads requiring immediate attention)</li><li>a new spatial support tool that maps wombat populations to help us understand the extent of mange and its effects on populations and to facilitate coordinated monitoring and treatment</li><li>an innovative research effort that will trial the remote delivery of a more effective and longer lasting mange treatment ACT Wildlife and Wombat Rescue are partnering with government on the project in an excellent example of how government and community volunteers can work together for good outcomes for a species in trouble. The University of Tasmania is providing advice from its own research and trials.</li></ul>\n\nThe wombat mange project progresses a commitment under the Parliamentary Agreement of the 10th Legislative Assembly to fund ACT Wildlife to undertake mange treatment in the ACT. Collaboratively, the ACT Government and community volunteers will deliver a coordinated and comprehensive mange treatment program across the ACT.\n\nThe project is part of a wider wombat management project being developed within ACT Government.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2020 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Australian lamb: Financial performance of lamb producers, 2013-14 to 2015-16 - Research report 16.9",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for lamb producers for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Lamb producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that sold, on average, 200 or more lambs for slaughter a year over the three years ending 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income of lamb producing farms rose on average over the period 2013-14 to 2014-15. The majority of the rise in farm incomes came from higher beef and lamb receipts due to increased prices and sales for both commodities. Average farm cash income of lamb producing farms is estimated to have increased further in 2015-16 mainly as a result of increased crop, wool and beef cattle sales. \r\n• Average incomes of lamb producing farms are estimated to have risen from 2014-15 to 2015-16 in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The majority of the increase in farm incomes in these states was from higher cropping receipts. \r\n• In real terms, the estimated average farm incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 were among the highest recorded since 2001-02. \r\n• Rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for lamb producers fell marginally from 2.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 2.5 per cent in 2014-15. The average rate of return is estimated to have increased in 2015-16 to around 3.0 per cent, reflecting higher incomes. \r\n• Average debt for lamb producers increased in real terms by around 88 per cent from $323 000 in 2000-01 (in 2015-16 dollars) to an estimated $605 000 in 2015-16. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of increases in average farm size and borrowing for land purchase, as well as for ongoing working capital. \r\n• Overall, changes in average debt over time have been modest relative to lamb producers' capacity to service debt by generating income. On average, around 8 per cent of lamb producers' farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments over the 10 years to 2015-16. In 2015-16 an estimated 6 per cent of farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments. \r\n",

    "title": "Photosynthetic and growth responses in three tropical seagrass species to pCO2 enrichment (440, 700, 890, 1204 µatm) (NERP TE 5.2, AIMS)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of one data file (spreadsheet) from a 2 week aquarium experiment manipulating pH (pCO2) changes and measuring photosynthetic and growth responses of three tropical seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii). \n\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased pCO2 would increase photosynthetic and growth rates to various extents between seagrass species.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nThis experiment exposed three seagrass species, Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii, to four pCO2 treatments (440, 700, 890, 1204 µatm) for two weeks to investigate the effects of acidification on their physiology. These treatments were chosen to bracket the range of atmospheric CO2 levels predicted for different end-of-century emission scenarios in the near-future (2100). Each treatment was replicated across four aquaria, each with 2 duplicate pots per species.\n\nC. serrulata and H. uninervis were collected from the intertidal meadow at Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef (19°10.88¿S, 146°50.63¿E) in late March 2013. T. hemprichii was collected from Green Island in the Northern Great Barrier Reef (16°45.37¿S, 145°58.19¿E) in early April 2013. H. uninervis and sediment was collected as intact plugs. C. serrulata and T. hemprichii were collected by excavating intact shoots with connected horizontal rhizomes from the sediment. The experiment started two to four weeks after the collection.\n\nPhotosynthetic rates and respiration of the second youngest leaf of a haphazardly chosen shoot from each pot were measured using optical oxygen sensors. Photosynthetic rates were measured over a series of light steps (10, 30, 70, 110, 220, 400, 510 µmol m-2 s-1), with each light step lasting 20 minutes. Rates were normalised to the dry weight of the leaf, after drying leaves at 60°C for 48 hours. To determine photosynthetic parameters (Pmax, alpha, Ek, Ec), photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-E) data plots were fitted to the adapted hyperbolic tangent model equation of Jassby and Platt (1976). Net productivity (NP) was taken to be the photosynthetic rate measured at the experimental light level (400 µmol m-2 s-1). Energetic surplus (PG:R) was calculated as the ratio of gross productivity to dark respiration rate. \n\nTo measure growth rates, all shoots were marked at the top of the sheath with a needle at the start of the experiment. After 14 days, the shoots were harvested, the length of new tissue growth were excised, dried at 60°C for 48 hours and weighed for determination of weight of new leaf growth. Leaf tissue growth was normalised to the aboveground biomass to derive relative leaf growth rates (RGR). Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated by dividing total leaf area with the total biomass of the leaves.\n\nChlorophyll content was determined by acetone extraction of chlorophyll from a young mature leaf from each pot at the end of the experiment. \nTo determine non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content, roots and rhizomes were dried at 60°C for 48 hours, before being homogenised. Soluble carbohydrates were extracted with 80% ethanol at 80°C. The amount of soluble carbohydrates was assayed after removal of phenolic compounds and acid hydrolysis. Starch content was analysed from the residue of the soluble carbohydrate extraction through enzyme (amylase and amyloglucosidase) digestion. The concentration of glucose is measured using a commercially available glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) testing reagent (Megazyme). Absorbance was then measured at 510 nm. Total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content was the sum of the amount of soluble carbohydrates and starch content.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nComma Separated File (CSV)\n\n\nData Dictionary:\n\nseagrass_pCO2only.csv:\n\n- pH: Average of the calculated pH of the aquarium over the experimental period.\n- pCO2 (uatm): average pCO2 levels over two weeks.\n- Temp_real (oC): Average of measured temperatures of the aquarium over the experimental period (N=3).

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2017. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Current meter and tide gauge data obtained from an off-shore mooring near Jervis Bay: 05/04/89 - 07/12/89",
    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed in 100m of water, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular, Jervis Bay. This mooring housed 3 current meters (at 30m, 55m and 90m water depth) and also a tide gauge. Over a period of approx. 8 months the mooring was deployed 3 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1 - 35.16 S, 150.817 E. \nDeployments 2 & 3 - 35.1267 S, 150.825 E. Datasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the three current meters over the study period.\n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 3 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2 & 3) for the upper two meters at 30m and 55m water depth. The current meter at 90m utilised sampling intervals of 10mins (deployments 1 & 2) and 30mins (deployment 3). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 11/4/89 - 5/6/89... 2) 28/7/89 - 29/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 29/11/89\n\nTIDE GAUGE: The tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~100m for all three deployments  In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "    \n\n:Mean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant\ncanopy for the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far\nmore spatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of\nwater limitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and\nseasonal pattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.\nCanopy transpiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the\ntotal evaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component\nof total evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. \n\nThe most obvious change in relative abundance in core BAR9403 (off the coast of Sumatra) is shown by sub-polar to transitional 'upwelling' species Ga. bulloides with abundances of 26% at approximately 14,000yrs BP and 22.7% during the Holocene. This is compared to the periods from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) where the relative abundance of Ga. bulloides is generally <10%. Gr. menardii, a tropical 'upwelling' species, also increases its relative abundance during MIS 2 from <8% during MIS 3 to a peak abundance of 16% at ~17,000yrs BP.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Peth (West) - Northbridge in WA with SA2 code 503021297, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a register (known as the Charity Register), which contains information about charities. This dataset is a subset of the information available on the Charity Register.\r\n\r\nAdditional information for each charity (including governing documents and names of any Responsible Persons) can be found by searching the Charity Register at [acnc.gov.au/charity](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nIn some situations, charities can apply to have some or all of their information withheld from the Charity Register.  If the ACNC has approved for the information to be withheld, it won’t appear on the Charity Register, or in this dataset. \r\n\r\nEach year, charities also lodge Annual Information Statements with the ACNC. These record further information about charities’ purposes, activities and operations for the year - the ACNC publishes datasets for each Annual Information Statement. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Tide gauge and water temperature data from three moorings in Jervis Bay: 05/12/88 - 11/01/89",
    "description": "Three pressure-sensor water-level recorders were deployed, at HMAS Creswell (Orange mooring), off Bowen Island (Black mooring) and off Point Perpendicular (Yellow mooring). These sensors recorded water level and water temperature at 10 minute intervals commencing on 05/12/88 and  finishing on 11/01/89. \n\nThe Yellow mooring line at Point Perpendicular broke during recovery, and was not recovered by divers until the 08/02/89. This tide gauge was (unintentionally) deployed on rocky steep sloping banks. The water level record revealed that the instrument had slipped down the steep banks on several occasions producing instantaneous changes in water level of up to 1m. These were removed from the data record. \n\nThe Black mooring was located at 35.1117 S 150.767 E with a sensor depth of 11m. \nThe Orange mooring was located at 35.1206 S 150.704 E with a sensor depth of 13m. \nThe Yellow mooring was located at 35.0967 S 150.802 E with a sensor depth of 20m.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "title": "Biological records for National Park islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef (NERP TE 9.3, JCU)",
    "description": "The database contains native and alien species records for National Park islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Attributes for each record include information on abundance, life history traits, habitat requirements, limitations of source, and relevant species information from government bodies including EPBC and NCA listings. Basic interaction information among species (alien vs. native) is also recorded. This dataset also has basic information about the islands such as area, location, and regional ecosystem types present on the island. \n\nOne shapefile, Island Threats, contains information on the presence and absence of a number of animals and plant threats on islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef as elicited from experts. Each spatially explicit point represents data for a given species on a specific island.\n\nAnother shapefile, Regional Ecosystems, contains information on the various Queensland Herbarium regional ecosystem (RE) types extracted for National Park Islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Individual polygons represent an area of a specific RE type.\n\nThe last shapefile, Features on Islands, contains information on the abundance of a number of native animals on islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef as elicited from experts. Each spatially explicit point represents data for a given species on a specific island.\n\nThis database was created as a basis for the decision support tool being developed for NERP 9.3. The database is the most complete dataset for the islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef at the time of release. \n\n\nMethod:\n\nDatabase:\nA comprehensive literature review was conducted for all published and ¿grey¿ source material containing biological records for National Park islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Unpublished species records were also compiled from sources such as WildNet, the Queensland Herbarium, and personal communications. For a given source, each species on each island received a unique record. Records were structured within the database so that each record remained associated with its source, allowing revisitation in order to review records within their original context. Attributes relevant to each record were extracted from source, including information on habitat requirements, life history traits, abundance, and source limitations e.g. incomplete sampling of island area. Additional attributes for each record were extracted from the Australian and Queensland government websites, including information on EBPC and CNA listings, and endemicity. \n\nIsland Threats:\nExperts who frequent the islands were consulted as to whether they believed a given threat was present or absent on the islands. These data were input into the associated access database Island_database.accbd, and then transformed into the point based shapefile.\n\nThe following is the list of threats considered in this dataset.\n* African Big Headed Ant\n* Black Rat\n* Brushtail Possum\n* Cane toad\n* Climbing Asparagus\n* Cobblers Peg\n* Red Junglefowl\n* Dwarf Poinsettia\n* Eastern Grey Kangaroo\n* Feral Cat\n* Feral Cattle\n* Feral Goat\n* Feral Horse\n* Feral Pig\n* Fox\n* Green Panic\n* Groundsel\n* Guinea Grass\n* Hog Deer\n* House Mouse\n* House Sparrow\n* Lantana\n* Morning Glory\n* Mother of Millions\n* Nightshade\n* Noogoora Burr\n* Periwinkle\n* Rubbervine\n* Singapore Daisy\n* Sisal Hemp\n* Soft Scale\n* Yellow Guava\n* Molasses Grass\n* Mossman River Grass\n* Mother-in-Law Tongue\n* Pink Periwinkle\n* Prickly Pear\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\nShape files of regional ecosystem (RE) types and National Park Islands in the Southern GBR were obtained from Queensland Herbarium (in 2014). These data were rearranged and merged to create a single shape file.\n\neAtlas editor note: It was noticed when mapping this shapefile that many of the polygon regions had multiple overlapping features, sometimes consisting of duplicates, and sometimes containing multiple RE codes. The cause of this in the dataset is unknown. A map of these overlaps was made by rendering them as black transparent polygons. This map is available in the download section of this metadata record. \n\nFeatures on Islands:\nExperts who frequent the islands were consulted as to the maximum and minimum number of individuals/pairs of native species on the islands. On each island there are multiple estimates for each species, one from each expert.\n\nThe following is the set of species that are included in this dataset.\n* Anous minutus (Black noddy)\n* Anous stolidus (Brown noddy)\n* Burhinus grallarius (Bush stone-curlew)\n* Calyptorhynchus lathami (Glossy black cockatoo)\n* Caretta caretta (Loggerhead sea turtle)\n* Charadrius ruficapillus (Red-capped plover)\n* Chelonia mydas (Green sea turtle)\n* Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae (Silver gull)\n* Egretta sacra (Pacific reef heron)\n* Epthianura crocea (Yellow chat)\n* Esacus magnirostris (Beach stone-curlew)\n* Falco peregrinus (Peregrine falcon)\n* Fregata ariel (Lesser frigatebird)\n* Fregata minor (Great frigatebird)\n* Gallirallus philippensis (Buff-banded rail)\n* Haematopus fuliginosus (Sooty oystercatcher)\n* Haematopus longirostris (Pied oystercatcher)\n* Haliaeetus leucogaster (White-bellied sea eagle)\n* Haliastur indus (Brahminy kite)\n* Hydroprogne caspia (Caspian tern)\n* Megapodius reinwardt (Orange-footed scrubfowl)\n* Natator depressus (Flatback sea turtle)\n* Onychoprion anaethetus (Bridled tern)\n* Onychoprion fuscata (Sooty tern)\n* Pandion cristatus (Osprey)\n* Phaethon rubricauda (Red-tailed tropicbird)\n* Phalacrocorax varius (Australian pied cormorant)\n* Phascolarctos cinereus (Koala)\n* Pluvialis squatarola (Grey plover)\n* Ptilinopus regina (Rose-crowned fruit dove)\n* Sterna dougallii (Roseate tern)\n* Sterna sumatrana (Black-naped tern)\n* Sternula albifrons (Little tern)\n* Sula dactylatra (Masked booby)\n* Sula leucogaster (Brown booby)\n* Thalasseus bengalensis (Lesser crested tern)\n* Thalasseus bergii (Greater crested tern)\n* Tringa brevipes (Grey-tailed tattler)\n* Xeromys myoides (False Water Rat)\n* Zosterops lateralis (Silvereye)\n\nFurther information on the methodology can be found in the final report for this project: Pressey, R., Wenger, A. (2015) Prioritising Management Actions for Great Barrier Reef Islands.\nhttp://www.nerptropical.edu.au/sites/default/files/publications/files/NERP9.3_final_report-FINAL-Complete.pdf\n\n\nLimitations of the data:\n\nDatabase:\nAbundance data varies over different units of time. For example in the ¿Total¿ column, 100 might indicate 100 individuals observed in a single survey, or over repeated visits to an island. The units of observation are maintained in the ¿Abundance¿ column, e.g. 100/birds January 2000. Values in the ¿Total¿ column should be interpreted in conjunction with the ¿Abundance¿ column.\nWe have removed any data for which we have data sharing agreements. Therefore, the database used for this project is much more comprehensive than we are able to submit.  \n\nIsland Threats:\nThe shapefile is limited to presence or absences only for a focal number of threats on targeted islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. There is no data on the number of individuals or the extent of the species on the islands. The presence or absence of a species is based on general consensus by experts. If there is no point for a given island/threat pair then the presence of absence of the species on that island is unknown.\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\nThe shapefile is limited to National Park Islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Information on RE types on other islands exists but was not the focus of this work. In some cases multiple polygons of the same shape and size exist for the same region of an island. Here a number of RE types were recorded within the polygon/area but the exact spatial extent of the RE is unknown, only the percentage of the polygon/area that the RE covers.\n\nFeatures on Islands:\nThe shapefile is limited to best guess estimates of the maximum and minimum number of individuals/pairs of a select number of native species on an island. The extent of the species on the island and how the population has changed over time are not known.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nIsland_database.accbd\nFormat: Access database.\nThis database contains a number of tables which are categorised according to their name:\n1 \"Records:¿\" are record tables where each row is a specific record relating to the focus of the table.\n2 \"Attributes:¿\" are attribute tables which have information specific to each category (e.g. islands, native animals, regional ecosystems. Attribute tables typically list the primary keys for each category which link to the records tables. \n3 \"Stats:¿\" are tables that contain basic statistics on records tables. These have been created using queries and will have queries with associated query names. \n4 \"Queries:¿\" are tables that have been created from queries (other than specific statistics queries) run on records/attributes tables and will have queries with associated query names. \n\nThis database also contains a number of queries which are based on the records/attributes tables, a most of which are linked to stats or queries tables of an associated name. See the ¿Design View¿ of any of the tables for more information, in particular for column/field descriptions. \n\nIsland Threats:\nThreats_on_Islands.*, GIS shape file \nProjected Coordinate System: GDA_1994_MGA_Zone_55\nProjection: Transverse_Mercator\n\n\nData dictionary:\n\n- Isl_name: name of the island where the record occurs\n- LONG: x co-ordinate location of the island (descimal degrees)\n- LAT: y co-ordinate location of the island (descimal degrees)\n- Threat: Common name of the threat\n- Interactio: Whether the threat species is present (1) or absent (0) on the island\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\n\nRE_on_NP_Islands.*, GIS shape file\nProjected Coordinate System: GDA_1994_MGA_Zone_55\nProjection: Transverse_Mercator\n\n\nData dictionary:\n\n- RE_type: Code for the regional ecosystem type, see associated access database Island_database.accbd for RE type descriptions\n- PC_of_Poly: percentage of the polygon that the RE covers.

    "description": "Land and emergency management agencies in Australia and\noverseas recognise the importance of an access network to support bushfire\nmanagement activities. Ground and aerial access provides a platform for fire\nreduction and readiness activities and provides opportunities to contain fires\nbefore they escalate into major fires that could otherwise incur significant\ncosts and potentially significant losses to community, cultural and\nenvironmental values.\n\n\nFire access within the ACT consists of a network of roads,\ntracks and trails that support fire prevention, readiness and response\nactivities. The identification and maintenance of fire access is an integral\nelement of fire management across the ACT.\n\n\nAccess management is divided into four areas :\n\n\n1.     maintenance\n\n\n2.     upgrade\n\n\n3.     construction\n\n\n4.     vegetation removal.\n\n\nACT PCS Fire Management Unit currently manage and maintain\napproximately 3,218 kilometres of roads and fire trails within the ACT. The\nclassification of fire roads, tracks and trails is performance based to provide\nclear guidance to response agencies during incidents.\n\n\nGround access is defined in four classes :\n\n\n1.     Float road – an access road\nor trail accessible to a low loader float carrying a large bulldozer or other\nheavy equipment.\n\n\n2.     Tanker road – a fire trail\nof strategic importance accessible to a heavy tanker and a tipper carrying a\nsmall bulldozer.\n\n\n3.     Light unit trail – a fire\ntrail accessible at minimum standard for a light unit.\n\n\n4.     Dormant fire trail – a trail\nthat has been deliberately closed or not maintained and can be quickly\nre-opened with minimal works.\n\n\nThe objective of ground access works are to upgrade and\nmaintain road pavements within the parks and reserves of the ACT to the above\nfour classes standard under the current Bushfire Operational Plan. Many areas\nrequire ongoing general maintenance or upgrading to an appropriate standard.\nThis is done principally to provide reliable access for operational\nrequirements and for fire suppression activities in the event of a wildfire\nthat may threaten the ACT.\n\n\nVegetation removal work is conducted by mechanical mulchers\nthat reduce vegetation on roads and trails that impede access for operational\nand fire suppression requirements identified under the current Bushfire\nOperational Plan. The Parks and Conservation Service Fire Management Unit also\ncommit a number of other contracted resources (graders, trucks, rollers,\nexcavators and backhoes etc) to conduct daily scheduled maintenance as well as\nupgrade and construction services on a yearly basis within the ACT.\n\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.actmapi.act.gov.au/\">Bushfire Map</a> shows the Environment, Planning &amp;\nSustainable Development  Directorate (EPSDD) Bushfire Operations Plan\n(BOP) for the current financial year.\n\n\nThe EPSDD BOP is derived from the 5-year Regional Fire\nManagement Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The EPSDD BOP details\nthe specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and\ninfrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current\nfinancial; year, in accordance with the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan\n(SBMP).\n\n\n",

The data covers migrating settlers arriving between 01/01/2017 and 31/12/2017. The data has been aggregated following the 2011 Local Government Areas (LGA) with available data.\nThe data in your reports are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Government Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere the recorded number of settlers is less than 5, the data has been set to null for confidentiality.\n\n\nSettlers which do not have a recorded LGA have been removed from the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Potential displacement of commercial fisheries by a Commonwealth marine reserve zoning scheme",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The Government commissioned an independent review of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves that were originally proclaimed in November 2012. The Department of the Environment commissioned ABARES to assess potential displacement of commercial fishing by alternative marine reserve designs and zoning options considered by the Bioregional Advisory Panel. The report details potential displacement by the network proclaimed in 2012 and the network recommended by the Panel in 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  • The potential impact of the Panel recommended (2015) zoning on commercial fisheries in the regions is relatively small, compared with the total gross value of production (GVP) from all wild capture fisheries. However, while much of the total impact is diffuse, some of the potential impact is concentrated in particular fisheries, entitlement holders and towns. \r\n• The Panel recommended (2015) zoning would potentially displace an estimated annual average 587.6 t of catch, with an annual average GVP of $4.51 million. This is less than the proclaimed network (2012), which would displace 1032 t of catch, with a GVP of $8.21 million. \r\n• For individual entitlements, there are a large number for which the potential impacts of the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning are relatively low (more than 700 entitlements with less than $2500 displaced per year) and a small number of entitlements for which the potential impacts are higher (17 entitlements over $50 000). The largest displacement from one entitlement was $164 000. These figures do not include South Australian entitlements because ABARES did not receive fisheries data at this scale for South Australian fisheries. A single business unit may hold multiple entitlements and so the impact on a business unit would be the sum of the individual entitlement impacts. \r\n• At the fishery level, the largest GVP displacements from the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning would be from the Western Australian West Coast Rock Lobster Fishery ($823 000), Commonwealth Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery ($585 800) and Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery ($488 200). \r\n• In terms of the proportion of GVP from the entire fishery, the largest displacements would be from the Commonwealth Coral Sea Fishery (71.2 per cent of fishery GVP), Western Australian North Coast Shark Fishery (33.9 per cent) and the Western Australian South West Trawl Fishery (13.2 per cent). \r\n• Towns with the highest potential GVP displacement were Mooloolaba in Queensland ($515 100), Geraldton in Western Australia ($449 200) and Fremantle in Western Australia ($406 300). \r\n• The estimated net economic impact of the Panel-recommended network would be reduced regional economic activity of $7.9 million in the short term. Potential short term employment impacts were separately estimated at 18 total jobs (estimate derived from previous economic modelling) and 49 jobs (estimate derived from previous surveys of fishers). Changes in economic activity at the state / territory level are expected to be negligible in terms of the size of the economies. These estimates have been made by rescaling previous economic modelling and survey results (from 2012); ABARES was not commissioned to undertake new economic modelling or surveys. \r\n\r\n Note: This document is hosted on the Department of Environment website.

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual fishing effort by fishery and gear, that fishers have recorded in their logbooks for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea. Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nFishing effort is measured differently depending on the fishing method used. In this dataset we provide the most common measures that are used by scientists. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe effort data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Effort data are used in combination with catch data, spatial data, and other relevant information (such as independent surveys) to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time-period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may standardise effort for assessments to account for issues such as changes in gear efficiency, catchability of fish and skipper expertise. They may also filter out effort from their assessments because of data quality issues.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect effort each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as closures of fishing areas or reducing boat numbers. Similarly, changes in market demand can change fishing decisions and affect effort. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1989 to February 1990. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "Strategic Bushfire Management Plan - Current Bushfire Prone Areas. The BPA map is a single risk-based map that defines the area of the ACT that has been assessed as being at high risk to life and property due to bushfires. Canberra’s built-up areas that are adjacent to forest and grassland are defined as BPAs, as is the ACT’s entire rural area.\n\nIdentifying the at-risk areas on the BPA map has two principal purposes:&nbsp;It requires assessment to determine mandatory construction standards for buildings under the Australian Standards AS 3959 – Construction of buildings in bushfire prone areas. Concurrent with the development of the SBMP, the ACT Government is considering arrangements to extend BPAs (for the purposes of AS 3959 assessments) to include part of the built-up area of CanberraIt provides the means by which people in the community can assess their personal level of risk and provide the basis for targeted The BPA map will be reviewed as required to reflect changes in land use and tenure, and will be approved by the Commissioner.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:&nbsp;The ACT Government is providing this bushfire management map for information purposes only. This data is derived from the best available vegetation. The ACT Government cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of any data and information contained on this site as, among other reasons, there may have been changes to land use and vegetation since the map was produced.

    "description": "A 6m steel pole has been installed within Central Bommie within the main lagoon of One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the main lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the main lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity. The pole is available for mounting of additional third part instruments and so forms an infrastructure to support future observational work at the Island.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Leadbeater's possum  Gymnobelideus leadbeateri  is a listed threatened species found mainly in montane ash and snowgum forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, with a small occurrence in swamp forests in Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Threats to the species include wildfire, loss of hollow-bearing trees, and the harvesting of native forests. As a consequence, the species is a focus of sustainable forest management. \r\n\r\n The species was nominated for re-listing as Critically Endangered under the  Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  (EPBC Act) in 2013, from its previous category of endangered, with comments on the nomination requested by January 2014. Its listing category was raised from Endangered to Critically Endangered in May 2015, based on the recommendation of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. An updated Draft Recovery Plan for the species was then prepared with input from stakeholders. \r\n\r\n Over the period from 2013 to 2017, ABARES prepared briefing notes regarding the listing, conservation, recovery and management of Leadbeater's possum and the related issue of fire and forest harvesting. This publication brings together a series of these briefing notes. \r\n\r\n The briefing notes are presented as written at the dates indicated, except that occasional minor or typographical errors have been corrected, URLs updated, intra- and inter-departmental references removed, and footnotes now include clarifying amendments. The briefing notes are individually paginated. ",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "The Biodiversity component of the LTIM Project evaluated the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to achieving diversity-related objectives of the Basin Plan by undertaking a qualitative evaluation of expected outcomes of watering actions undertaken by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO). \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project focused on examining the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan), while assisting the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas:were the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nThe main data output of the Biodiversity evaluation is an aggregated list of species and communities that potentially benefitted from Commonwealth environmental water from 2014-15 to 2018-19. This is derived from other Basin Matter reports (Vegetation, Fish, Ecosystem Diversity), Selected Area monitoring, the Atlas of Living Australia and monitoring programs external to LTIM (e.g. the Living Murray, Bird Life Australia). \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Biodiversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.

    "title": "Results of benthic organisms, reef fishes and manta tow surveys of Capricorn Bunker reefs in October 2015 (NESP TWQ 3.7, AIMS)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of summaries of benthic, fish and manta tow surveys conducted in the Capricorn-Bunker Region of the Great Barrier Reef in October 2015. It consists of three tables:\n\n1. A table summarising percent cover of benthic organisms grouped into broad categories from photo transects collected during the monitoring surveys.\n2. A table of average abundance for each reef fish species on the 5 transects in each of the three sites on each reef is presented for the eight reefs surveyed.\n3. A table of the average reef wide coral cover, the mean reef-wide density of crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS), Acanthaster planci and the mean reef-wide density of coral trout for each reef based on manta tow surveys.\n\nThis dataset is an extract from part of the AIMS Long Term Monitoring database.\n\nThe rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in 2004 increased the number and extent of ¿no-take¿ areas within the Park. This project surveys pairs of reefs, one in a ¿no-take¿ or green zone and the other a similar reef where fishing is allowed (blue zone), in five regions of the GBRMP. Green and blue zones will be surveyed for the abundance and size of fishery species, particularly coral trout, as well as wider effects on coral reef communities. Surveys of coral communities are undertaken in the same location as surveys of fishes. Biennial surveys commenced in 2006.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nBenthic surveys:\nCoral communities were surveyed on eight reefs (Boult Reef, Broomfield Reef, Erskine Reef, Fairfax Islands Reef, Hoskyn Islands Reef, Lady Musgrave Reef, Mast Head Reef, North Reef (North)) in the Capricorn-Bunkers region using digital still images taken along five permanent 50 m transects in each of three sites per reef (n = 15 transects). Forty images were selected randomly from the fifty taken per transect for analyses. The benthic organisms under five points per image arranged in a quincunx pattern were identified (n = 200 points per transect). Benthic organisms were identified to the highest taxonomic resolution possible and each organism is assigned a lifeform based on its shape. Data were converted to percent cover and the site averages is presented for each reef surveyed. AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10.  The data summaries the latest survey from a time-series of biennial surveys that commenced in 2006. Temporal trends at each reefs are available on http://data.aims.gov.au/reefpage2/allreefs.jsp\n\nReef fish surveys:\nThe abundance of ten families of conspicuous, diurnally active reef fishes was enumerated using standard underwater visual census techniques. Sites are located in a standard reef slope habitat on the north-eastern flank of each reef between 6 to 12m, and consist of five permanently marked 50 m transect (n=15 per reef). Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were surveyed on one metre wide belt transects while the remaining nine families of large mobile fishes (Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Serranidae and Zanclidae) were counted on five metre wide belts. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 3.\n\nManta tow surveys:\nBroadscale surveys of reef-wide coral cover, densities of crown-of-thorns starfish and of coral trout using manta tows involve a snorkel diver being towed around the perimeter of the reef.  The boat stops every 2 min to allow data to be recorded. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 9.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.csv, CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.shp:\nAverage percent cover of groups of benthic organisms on each of 3 sites on survey reefs in the Capricorn-Bunkers, GBR\nDescription of lifeforms are published in the Standard Operation Procedures, Appendix III\nSee: AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10\n\nThe following are the classifications in the dataset:\n- Turf algae\n- Tabulate Acropora\n- Coralline algae\n- Branching Acropora\n- Encrusting non-Acropora\n- Sand\n- Massive non-Acropora\n- Macroalgae\n- Submassive non-Acropora\n- Soft coral\n- Digitate Acropora\n- Arb & Enc Soft Coral\n- Arborescent Soft Coral\n- Capitate Soft Coral\n- Foliose non-Acropora\n- Encrusting Acropora\n- Millepora\n- Branching non-Acropora\n- Submassive Acropora\n- Sponge\n- Other organisms\n- Encrusting Soft Coral\n- Zoanthid\n- Bottlebrush Acropora\n- Dead coral (recent)\n- Rubble\n- Lobate Soft Coral\n- Massive Soft Coral\n- Mushroom coral\n- Abiotic\n- Solitary coral\n- Unknown\nThe shapefile was created from the CSV. This process involved truncating the attribute names to comply with 10 character limit of the shapefile format. The CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.aliases.csv file contains a lookup table that maps the shortened attribute names in the shapefile to the original longer names in CSV file.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Fish_2015-10.csv:\nConsists of a summary of the raw counts of reef fishes. The average abundance for each reef fish species per 1,000 m2  is presented for each of the 3 sites on the eight reefs surveyed in October 2015. Note: this table also includes rows for species that were searched for, but none were observed. These correspond to rows where the abundance is 0.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Manta-tow_2015-10.csv:\nSummary of the manta tow results for the surveyed reefs, including the mean hard coral cover (average over all tows on reef), CoTS (count per tow) and trout (count per tow). \n\n\nData Location:\n\nThis dataset is saved in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\NESP1\\3.7_GBR_Zoning\\",

    "description": "Since the 1980s the managers of alpine resorts have collected information on visitation numbers.  Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

    "description": "\n\n\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (stretches of waterway) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. The most abundant species within core MD002361 is the subtropical species Gs. ruber. High abundances =30% are seen during the interglacial periods Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 11, 9, 7, 5 with peak abundance (37.7%) during the Holocene. Other tropical and subtropical species follow this pattern. The transitional, deep dwelling species Gr. inflata has the most distinct abundance change within core MD002361. This species is absent during the interglacial periods but achieves high relative abundances (~20-30%) during glacial periods.",

    "description": "    \n\nCalculated annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) potential evaporation (mm) for the\nperiod 1980-1999. Calculated by the Priestley-Taylor method. Interpretation:\nPotential evaporation is an expression of the amount of water that it should\nbe possible to evaporate from an open water surface given the prevailing solar\nradiation, air temperature, and air dryness conditions. Potential evaporation\nis generally high over the Australian continent, significantly exceeding\nrainfall in all but the wettest areas. It is extreme (approaching 10mm/day) in\nthe northern inland in summer. It decreases with decreasing solar radiation,\nthat is with increasing southern latitude and in winter. Potential evaporation\nalso decreases with proximity to coasts, because of increasing cloudiness.\nActual evaporation is controlled by the various resistances to moisture loss\noffered by plants and soil. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation.EvapPT.00, EvapPT.01 a| EvapPT.12 a Mean\nannual and monthly potential evaporation (mm)Data is in albers equal area, and\nunprojected using GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ampe_r9cl\n__01512a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. \r\n\r\n A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\n The dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 presents the new NFI classification with three national forest categories, as reported by the NFI in  Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013  (SOFR 2013), and replaces the spatial dataset titled Forests of Australia (2013). The three national forest categories are: Native forest, Industrial plantations and Other forests. The 'Native forest' category has previously been reported by the NFI, however, 'Industrial plantations' and 'Other forests' are new categories for planted forests: 'Industrial plantations', for plantations managed commercially and reported through the National Plantation Inventory (NPI), and 'Other forest' for planted forest not managed commercially or otherwise not reported through the NPI. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's  National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS)  and the  Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) Act 2002.  The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1990. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile of the core (revealing sedimentation rates), the relative abundance of planktonic foraminifera over time, and estimates of historical sea-surface temperatures.",

    "description": "Rodrigues is located at latitude 19°43' S and longitude 63°25' E in the Southwest Indian Ocean and features the best developed reefs in the Mascarenes. \n\nIn 2001 a field expedition to Rodrigues recovered six drill cores using a portable hydraulic drilling rig. In all, two cores were recovered from the windward margin (cores 10 and 17), with a maximum depth of penetration of 4 m. Four cores were recovered from the leeward margin (8, 14, 15, 18) where the maximum depth penetration attained was 4.2 m. Recovery ranged from 23 to 63 %.\n\nThin sections were made and examined petrographically. Radiocarbon dating was performed on selected corals from the base of each core interpreted to have grown in situ and to be free from intraskeletal contamination.\n\nRadiometric dating suggests that Rodrigues reefs approached sea level between 3.1 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP and 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. In fact, the windward margin apparently grew to within 2.5 m of present day sea level by approximately 2.7 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. The leeward margin approached modern day sea level more recently between 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP and 2.4 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion for the top 4 m of the cores range from 0.46 - 1.96 m / kyr.",

The survey was funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin accounts for about three-quarters of Australia's citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit production with a large percentage of these crops grown in the southern Basin. \r\n",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nThe Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2020) is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management and co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the same as the previously published Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2020) (released 03 December 2020) but with an amended title that more accurately reflects the full extent of the dataset.\r\n\r\nIt was developed from multiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets related to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous land dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the Forests of Australia (2018) dataset.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of final datasets. The following attributes are applied in this dataset:\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous owned__: Freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land and forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: Land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: Land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan.\r\n\r\n* __Other special rights__: Land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements and legislated special cultural use provisions.\r\n\r\nIn this dataset, the attributes of Indigenous ownership, Indigenous management or co-management, and other special rights are applied separately. The dataset structure therefore differs from Indigenous estate datasets published by ABARES in 2018 or earlier.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "*Fires in Australia’s Forests 2011–16 (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof the extent and frequency of planned and unplanned fires occurring in\r\nforest in the five financial years between July 2011 and June 2016,\r\nassembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was\r\ndeveloped from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and\r\nterritory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest\r\nFire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest\r\ncover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018, \r\nand forest tenure information sourced from the *Tenure of Australia’s\r\nForests (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a\r\nfinancial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event\r\noccurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is\r\nrecorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into\r\ntwo categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and\r\nadvice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe *Fires in Australia’s forests 2011–16 (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is provided as part of the five-yearly Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n The March edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities to 2021-22. \r\n The outlook will be an important focal point at the conference and underpin many presentations delivered by ABARES speakers at the conference. \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts, as well as articles on the EU sheep meat industry; farm performance of broadacre and dairy farms; productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries; and disaggregating farm performance by size. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8.3 per cent to a record $63.8 billion in 2016-17 before easing by 3.9 per cent to a forecast $61.3 billion in 2017-18. Despite the forecast decline, the gross value of farm production in 2017-18 would be 17.3 per cent higher than the average of $52.3 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 4.4 per cent to $31.2 billion in 2017-18, following a forecast decrease of 2.6 per cent in 2016-17. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of livestock production in 2017-18 would be around 28 per cent higher than the average of $24.4 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to decrease by 11.3 per cent to $30 billion in 2017-18, after a forecast increase of 20.2 per cent in 2016-17. The decrease follows record production of wheat and barley in 2016-17, which resulted from favourable seasonal conditions during winter and spring. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of crop production in 2017-18 would be around 8 per cent higher than the average of $27.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• In 2021-22 the gross value of farm production is projected to be around $59.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8.6 per cent higher than the average of $54.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 (also in 2016-17 dollars). In 2021-22 the gross value of crop production is projected to be around $29.0 billion and the gross value of livestock production is projected to be around $30.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars). \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $48.7 billion in 2017-18, higher than the forecast $47.7 billion in 2016-17. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2017-18 are beef and veal (up 1 per cent), wool (10 per cent), dairy products (11 per cent), sugar (10 per cent), cotton (35 per cent), wine (5 per cent), lamb (3 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (4 per cent), rock lobster (6 per cent) and mutton (1 per cent). \r\n• Forecast increases in 2017-18 are expected to be partly offset by expected declines in export earnings for wheat (down 9 per cent), coarse grains (11 per cent), canola (6 per cent) and chickpeas (42 per cent). \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of wool, dairy products, sugar, wine, lamb, barley, canola, rock lobster and mutton are forecast to increase in 2017-18. Export prices for cotton and chickpeas are forecast to fall. Prices for beef and veal, wheat and live feeder/slaughter cattle are forecast to remain around the same as in 2016-17. \r\n• In 2021-22 the value of farm exports is projected to be around $46.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8 per cent higher than the average of $43.1 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• The value of crop exports is projected to be $24.9 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 7 per cent higher than the average of $23.2 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. The value of livestock exports is projected to be $21.8 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 10 per cent higher than the average of $19.8 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 2.3 per cent in 2017-18 to $1.5 billion, after decreasing by a forecast 3.4 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 3.3 per cent in 2017 and 3.4 per cent in 2018. Growth is expected to rise further to around 3.5 per cent in 2019 before declining to 3.4 per cent in 2021 and 3.3 per cent in 2022. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.8 per cent in 2017-18. Over the medium term to 2021-22, economic growth is assumed to average around 3 per cent. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2017-18, slightly lower than the forecast average of US75 cents in 2016-17. It is assumed to appreciate slightly over the medium term, reaching US74 cents towards 2021-22. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n The EU sheep meat industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers of sheep meat. Imports are controlled by import quotas and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• Australia is the second largest exporter to the European Union, behind New Zealand, although its allocated quota is just 8 per cent that of New Zealand's. \r\n• As a high value market for sheep meat, expanding sheep meat exports to the European Union would benefit the Australian industry. However, until the trade outcomes of Brexit are known, opportunities for Australian sheep meat exporters are uncertain. \r\n\r\n Farm performance: broadacre and dairy farms, 2014-15 to 2016-17  \r\n• In 2016-17 farm cash income for Australian broadacre farms is projected to average $216,000 a farm, the highest recorded in the past 20 years. \r\n• Record broadacre farm cash incomes this year are the result of near record winter grain production in most regions and good prices for beef cattle, sheep, lamb and wool. \r\n• Average farm cash income is projected to increase for broadacre farms in all states except Tasmania in 2016-17. \r\n• Farm cash income for dairy farms is projected to decline by 17 per cent nationally to an average of $105,000 a farm in 2016-17, reflecting lower average farmgate milk prices and reduced milk production. \r\n\r\n Productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries  \r\n• From 1977-78 to 2014-15, productivity in the broadacre industries averaged 1.1 per cent a year as a result of declining input use (down 1 per cent a year) and modest output growth (up 0.1 per cent a year). \r\n• In the dairy industry, productivity growth averaged 1.5 per cent a year between 1978-79 and 2014-15. This reflected average annual growth of 1.3 per cent in output and an average annual decline of 0.2 per cent in input use. \r\n\r\n Disaggregating farm performance by size  \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms produced 46 per cent of total output, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms produced 12 per cent of total output. \r\n• The average rate of return, including capital appreciation, generated by the largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms was 8.2 per cent, while the smallest 10 per cent generated average returns of -2.8 per cent. \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms had the lowest average equity ratio of all farms (79 per cent), while the smallest 10 per cent of farms had the highest average equity ratio (97 per cent). \r\n",

    "description": "\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (related waterbodies) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

    "title": "Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017",
    "description": "##This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at September 2017. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update May 2016 released in June 2016. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the May 2016 version: Desert Channels and Mackay-Whitsundays natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland; the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges NRM region in South Australia (extending into part of the Murray-Darling Basin NRM region); the state of New South Wales; the state of Victoria; the state of Tasmania; the state of Western Australia; and the Northern Territory. The capital city of Adelaide was also updated using 2016 mesh block information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This equates to over 585 million hectares or 76% of Australia, the largest update of catchment scale land use mapping to date. \r\n\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. Users should also note that it is not possible to calculate land use change statistics between annual CLUM national compilations as not all regions are updated each year; land use mapping methodologies, precision, accuracy and source data (in particular satellite imagery) have improved over the years; and the land use classification has changed over time. In particular, the major differences between this September 2017 version and the May 2016 version are:\r\n\r\n* The September 2017 version has been mapped to version 8 of the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification (released in October 2016)\r\n* Improvements to the Western Australia mapping including improved mapping of native forests, conservation areas, topographic features, horticulture and intensive animal production\r\n* Changes to the mapping of native and modified pastures in New South Wales\r\n* Changes to the mapping of dairies in Tasmania so that only the dairy infrastructure is mapped as dairies and the dairy pastures are mapped as modified pastures.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to calculate change when earlier land use datasets have been revised and corrected to ensure that changes detected are real change and not an artefact of the mapping process. The Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) have done this on an NRM regions basis for Queensland and can be accessed at:\r\n\r\n* Data: Search the Queensland Spatial Catalogue (http://dds.information.qld.gov.au/dds/) for \"Land Use Mapping\"\r\n* Reports: https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/vegetation/mapping/qlump-reports.\r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). As a seamless spatial dataset for Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as irrigated horticulture and dryland cropping) and more specific land use categories such as grapes, cotton, cereals, sugar and tree fruits. These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Australia. A complementary dataset Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017 provides commodity level mapping as a vector dataset. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of catchment scale mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The date of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. The most current mapping occurs in intensive agricultural areas; older mapping generally occurs in the semi-arid and pastoral zones. \r\nThe primary classes of land use in the ALUM Classification are:\r\n \r\n1. Conservation and natural environments - land used primarily for conservation purposes, based on maintaining the essentially natural ecosystems present\r\n2. Production from relatively natural environments - land used mainly for primary production with limited change to the native vegetation\r\n3. Production from dryland agriculture and plantations - land used mainly for primary production based on dryland farming systems\r\n4. Production from irrigated agriculture and plantations - land used mostly for primary production based on irrigated farming\r\n5. Intensive uses - land subject to extensive modification, generally in association with closer residential settlement, commercial or industrial uses\r\n6. Water - water features (water is regarded as an essential aspect of the classification, even though it is primarily a land cover type, not a land use)\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). ACLUMP, of which ABARES is a partner, promotes the development of consistent information on land use and land management practices. This consortium of Australian, state and territory government partners is critical to providing nationally consistent land use mapping at both catchment and national scale, underpinned by common technical standards including an agreed national land use classification. ACLUMP provides a national land use data directory and the maintenance of land use datasets on Australian and state government data repositories.

    "description": "This short core obtained off Sumatra (BAR9403, 5.82 S, 104.0316 E) records the palaeoceanography from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present day. The lightest 18O value (-2.99ppt) is recorded during the Holocene (~5cm depth) while the LGM (~125cm depth) is positioned at the heaviest 18O value of -0.59ppt. Once the estimated ice volume effect has been accounted for, this still leaves a substantial difference in 18O which must be accounted for through significant changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) or salinity. The 13C record ranges from a minimum at approximately 8500 yrs BP of 0.16ppt to a maximum value of 1.31ppt during MIS 3.",

    "description": "ABARES Lessons from the water market report analyses trends in water allocation prices in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), between 2000-01 and 2015-16. This report analyses the major demand and supply side drivers of water allocation prices in the sMDB, drawing on historical data for 2000-01 to 2015-16. The study disentangles the effects of climate variability (rainfall, water storage and allocation volumes) from the key policy changes (including Commonwealth purchase of entitlements for the environment) and irrigation sector changes that have occurred during the period. \r\n\r\nKey Issues • The main driver of change in water prices over this period has been variation in rainfall, storages and allocations. During the peak of the drought water prices jumped to more than $1 000 per ML, before dropping to near zero during the flood years (2010-11 and 2011-12). Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, storage volumes steadily decreased and prices steadily increased. \r\n• However, ABARES finds that even after controlling for these dry conditions, market prices during 2014-15 and 2015-16 were higher than expected from past experience. The report finds that these higher prices can be explained by a combination of demand and supply factors including: Commonwealth entitlement purchases, state carryover rule changes, interregional trade restrictions and commodity price fluctuations and irrigation land-use changes. \r\n• While Commonwealth entitlement purchases reduce the supply of water and have an upward effect on prices, these are offset to some extent by Commonwealth investments in water saving infrastructure. Further, even if water savings are ignored, Commonwealth entitlement purchases offer only a partial explanation for the increase in water prices. \r\n• Another important factor has been changes to carryover rules particularly in Victoria, which have led to large increases in carryover volumes since 2007-08. This increase carryover since 2007-08 has contributed to higher allocation prices in the market. Despite this, carryover remains a positive development that will benefit irrigators in the long run by keeping prices lower in drought years. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the number of permanent settlers in Australia by migrations streams; humanitarian, family and skilled. The data covers migrating settlers with a Date of Settlement between 01/07/2020 and 30/06/2021. The location data is aggregated based on the Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries of the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data in this dataset are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit Data.gov.au.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data with the 2011 LGA boundaries of the ABS Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC). Where the recorded number of settlers is less than 5 (\"&lt;5\" in the original table), it has been set to 4 for confidentiality.",

    "description": "*Forests of Australia (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation\r\nand land cover data inputs, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as:\r\n\"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single\r\nstem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2021) (unpublished, also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2020), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map as forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nTwenty-seven crabs (13 males, 14 females) were observed on the day after spring tide over several semilunar cycles. Digital photos of the crabs were taken before, during and after low tide. These photographs were examined for any changes in colour or pattern. \n\nUca capricornis do not regularly change their colouration over the course of the day. Of the 27 individuals observed, 24 did not noticeably change their colour, and none altered their pattern.",

    "description": "This dataset contains the extent of the coastal zone for the Great Barrier Reef. This extent was identified as the most suitable area to be investigated on land and at sea as part of a conservation planning project looking at coastal development along the GBR coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial part of the coastal zone was initially defined in consultation with stakeholders and included the Queensland Government¿s definition as ¿either: five kilometres from the coastline; or where land first reaches the height of 10 metres Australian Height Datum (AHD), whichever is further from the coast¿ (Queensland Coastal Management Plan). However, the Queensland government definition corresponds to a narrow strip of coastline in most areas and does not encompass most of coastal land uses (and their potential future expansion) that have a significant impact on the marine environmental such as agriculture. In the context of biodiversity conservation and water quality, workshop participants were asked what the coastal zone meant to them. The answers were summarised into four main categories:\r\n1- Intensive coastal-based agriculture,\r\n2- Geomorphological characteristics,\r\n3- Typical coastal vegetation, and\r\n4- Human presence and activities.\r\nThe coastal zone was defined to include all features that would match these four categories, and that also included the Government¿s definition. The marine part of the coastal zone was also defined during this process and the offshore boundary was described as the maximum flood plume extent (secondary flood plume) as in Álvarez-Romero et al. 2013. The extent was smoothed to allow a clear area to be defined. This covers the areas that are have the greatest level of impacts from coastal development, in particular from run-off.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nGBR_coastal_zone.shp (and all associated files as part of the shapefile)\r\nThis dataset contains a polygon that defines the extent of the area identified as the most appropriate coastal zone of the Great Barrier Reef to investigate conservation planning, in particular spatial planning of coastal development to ensure the health for the GBR World Heritage Area.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nÁlvarez-Romero, J.

    "description": "A round 1.4m yellow buoy has been deployed in the Heron Island lagoon as part of the sensor network infrastructure at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, a spread-spectrum radio for communicating with the on-reef wireless network, a GPS and initially a surface mounted (30cm under the water surface) thermistor.\n\nThe float is moored in the lagoon of Heron Island in around 3m of water and will be used to monitor the flow of water through the lagoon. It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This technical report estimates the responsiveness of demand for structural pine to changes in timber and steel prices. Measures of demand responsiveness can provide valuable insights into the potential implications of changes in policy or market settings on volumes and prices received by producers. The analysis focuses on estimating short-term price elasticities of demand--a formal measure of the sensitivity of demand--to changes in prices in the same quarter or recent past. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The estimates in this report suggest that the importance of timber and steel prices on the quantity of structural timber demanded in the short-run is limited. However, the volume of residential construction activity was found to have a substantial effect for demand of domestically produced structural pine products. In particular, new house commencements explain a great deal of the quarter-on-quarter changes in the quantity of domestic structural pine sales. This confirms the common assertion by industry that house commencements are the primary driver for structural timber demand within Australia. \r\n\r\n Looking forward, changes in consumer preferences, socio-demographic trends and building regulations will likely play a much greater role in the choice of building materials used in housing construction compared with timber and steel prices. Trends suggest consumers are placing more weight on the environmental benefits of structural materials. Changing architectural styles will change the material requirements for a standard home. A global trend towards higher-density living will likely promote a shift toward multi-unit buildings, with recent changes to the National Construction Code opening the way for increased timber use in the midrise construction market, leading to greater timber use in multi-level buildings. \r\n",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps\">riverine flooding</a> in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nSee some <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information\">frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding</a>.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Long Beach in the east, to Huskisson in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 7 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "The National Reef Monitoring Network brings together shallow reef surveys conducted around Australia into a centralised database. The IMOS National Reef Monitoring Network sub-Facility collates, cleans, stores and makes this data rapidly available from contributors including: Reef Life Survey, Parks Australia, Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia), Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (South Australia), Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales), Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service and Parks Victoria.\n\nThe data provided by the National Reef Monitoring Network contributes to establishing and supporting national marine baselines, and assisting with the management of Commonwealth and State marine reserves. \n\nReef Life Survey (RLS) and the Australian Temperate Reef Network (ATRC) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources by coordinating surveys of rocky and coral reefs using scientific methods, with the ultimate goal to improve coastal stewardship. Our activities depend on the skills of marine scientists, experienced and motivated recreational SCUBA divers, partnerships with management agencies and university researchers, and active input from the ATRC partners and RLS Advisory Committee.\n\nRLS and ATRC data are freely available to the public for non-profit purposes, so not only managers, but also groups such as local dive clubs or schools may use these data to look at changes over time in their own local reefs. By making data freely available and through public outputs, RLS and ATRC aims to raise broader community awareness of the status of Australia's marine biodiversity and associated conservation issues.\n\nThis dataset contains records of cryptobenthic fishes collected by RLS and ATRC divers and partners along 50m transects on shallow rocky and coral reefs using standard methods. Abundance information is available for all species recorded within quantitative survey limits (50 x 1 m swathes either side of the transect line, each distinguished as a 'Block'), with divers searching the reef surface (including cracks) carefully for hidden fishes. These observations are recorded concurrently with the macroinvertebrate observations and together make up the 'Method 2' component of the surveys. For this method, typically one 'Block' is completed per 50 m transect for the program ATRC and 2 blocks are completed for RLS - although exceptions to this rule exist.\n\nThis dataset supersedes the RLS specific \"Reef Life Survey (RLS): Cryptic Fish\" collection that was available at https://catalogue-rls.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?uuid=6a56db3f-d1b2-438d-98c6-bd7dd540a4d5 (provision of data was stopped in June 2021).",

The ability to trace livestock allows Australia to respond quickly to food safety incidents and disease outbreaks. The purpose of this Decision Regulation Impact Statement (Decision RIS) is to recommend a preferred option for improving the NLIS for sheep and goats to meet the National Livestock Traceability Performance Standards. \r\n\r\n This Decision RIS identifies the nature of the problem to be solved and explains the rationale for the preferred option. It also assesses the costs and benefits of all the options under consideration. This Decision RIS follows the guidelines of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in the Best Practice Regulation Guide. It has been approved for release by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. ",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1. Is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.\n 2. Has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses.\n 3. Is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which:\n   - May involve unstable and/or unpredictable variables and is therefore limited in its accuracy and applicability; and,\n   - Will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.\n\n 4. Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n 5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n 6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nAccordingly,\n\n 1. While the information presented on this website attempts to represent what may be experienced during a flood, actual flood events may differ substantially.\n\n 2.

The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset. \r\n\r\n The update was necessary in order to align the forest cover types of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013) and also to introduce an attribute containing forest category information into the dataset. The update had no impact on the Indigenous land management categories reported by the Australia's Indigenous forest estate dataset, and minimal impact on the area of forest types reported against each land management category. \r\n\r\n\tThe  Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0 dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands, and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\n\tThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and SOFR 2013. The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are: 1.\tIndigenous owned and managed; \r\n2.\tIndigenous managed; \r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and \r\n4.\tOther Special rights. \r\n These categories align with the reporting requirements for the NIFS and SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1988. For each day of sampling three resources are provided in the compressed (zipped) folder: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 4. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Radiocarbon dating was used to construct an age model for the upper sections of core MD002361 to a depth of 205cm, after which the age-model was based on the chronology of Bassinot et al. as the core extends beyond the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) of SPECMAP. The age versus depth profile for this core shows a step-like pattern with increased sedimentation rates during interglacial periods and decreased rates during glacial periods. The average sedimentation rate over the length of the core is 2.5cm/1000yrs, with a high sedimentation rate illustrated during the holocene (15cm/1000yrs). It appears that the sedimentation rate may be affected by river discharge, with an increase in red-brown sediment during the interglacial periods. This is shown with an increase in sedimentation rate during MIS 5 and MIS 11. The age at the deepest part of the core (1360cm) is ~549,058yrs BP.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "ACNC 2013 Annual Information Statement data",
    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is  the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012,  charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. \r\n\r\nGenerally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. \r\n\r\nThis dataset provides a record of the 2013 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2013 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2012 – 30 June 2013, for others it will be the 2013 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nFor the 2013 financial year (being the first period for reporting to the ACNC), the Commissioner exercised her discretion to extend the due date for lodgement to 31 March 2014. As at August 2014, approximately 42 000 registered charities have filed their 2013 AIS with the ACNC. The dataset is updated fortnightly.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the [ACNC Register](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity). There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information:\r\n\r\n-\tis commercially sensitive and it could cause harm\r\n-\tis false, confusing or misleading\r\n-\tis offensive\r\n-\tcould endanger public safety\r\n-\tfalls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund).\r\n\r\nSome charities have asked for their details to be withheld. If their withholding request is pending or has been approved, the AIS data relating to these charities has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity).\r\n\r\nThe 2013 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2013 reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS will ask further questions, particularly in relation to financial information for medium and large charities. The dataset of 2014 Annual Information Statements will be uploaded to data.gov.au in due course.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datatsets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThis data relates to the average annual family income of broadacre and dairy\r\nfarm properties which responded to the ABARE annual farm survey over a three\r\nyear period from 1996 -1997 to 1998 -1999. Average annual family income is\r\ncalculated as the family share of farm income plus any wages (that are\r\nincluded as farm costs for taxation assessment) paid to the owner manager,\r\nspouse and dependant children, plus all off-farm income of owner manager and\r\nspouse. The data is reported at the Statistical Division (SD) level for\r\nAustralia. This data relates to broadacre and dairy farms run by owner\r\nmanagers and has been collected by annual farm survey interview and is\r\nsupplemented by information in the farm accounts. The data is presented at a\r\nscale of 25000000. The following attributes are contained within the dataset;\r\nSd code a a unique 3 digit code for Statistical Divisions (SD), Sd name a the\r\nname of the Statistical Division (SD), Faminc a the average annual farm family\r\nincome for the period 1996-1997 to 1998-1999. RSE a the relative standard\r\nerror of the average farm equity ratio for the period 1996-1997 to 1998-1999.\r\nAg_land_ha a hectares of agricultural land use in the Statistical Division\r\n(SD). Note that metropolitan areas are assigned a value of -99999, whilst\r\nareas with no data are assigned a value of -88888.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_afi__r9aa\r\n__00512a00.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2018 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "title": "Over-arching record: Water Circulation of Jervis Bay (Jervis Bay Baseline Studies Project 8)",
    "description": "The Jervis Bay Project was set up to undertake baseline studies of the key habitats and species in Jervis Bay on the New South Wales coast, and to develop a monitoring program to assist with long-term management of the bay. It was funded by the Department of Defence who at that time planned to relocate the fleet base of the Royal Australian Navy to Jervis Bay, and although this plan was abandoned mid-way through the study, the study was completed and the final report published in 1994.\n\nA series of 12 projects were proposed, with the 8th, 'Water Circulation of Jervis Bay' being undertaken by the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of this project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nTwo experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay. The first during the summer months when the bay is normally thermally stratified, from 6th December 1988 to 11th January 1989, and the second during winter when thermal stratification is generally much weaker, from 10th July to 30th October 1990. Between these two experiments, moorings were maintained in the bay entrance and on the shelf, from April 1989 to April 1990, in order to investigate exchange processes between the bay and shelf waters. Further, to better understand the partition of energy from the wind through the water column, two deployments were made with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler that gives current time series at 1m depth intervals over most of the water column. A summer deployment of the Doppler profiler was run from December 1990 to January 1991 and a winter deployment was run from July to September 1991. Approximately once per month throughout the three year period, 1989-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within the bay and out across the shelf to provide additional information on the water exchange and circulation.\n\nAvailable to download through this record is a pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project. Also available are the pdfs of the published working papers documenting the research. There are seven subsiduary records that directly relate to this over-arching record (see hierarchical tree): \n06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8 \n84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\n5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\nb146e140-2ae6-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\nc571bb80-2ae7-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\n13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\n629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8",

    "description": "This interactive dashboard contains a map and graphs to indicate the loss of mature trees in the urban area of the ACT, from 2015 to 2020.  The map uses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data\ncaptured in 2015 and 2020 to plot the trajectory of mature tree loss over time. The associated graphs\nand diagrams indicate mature tree loss by suburb, land use and suburb age. These metrics can be used to assess the loss of mature trees across the landscape as required under the Loss of Mature Native Trees Action Plan 2021.\n\nCaveats for the LiDAR-derived data used in this dashboard:\n1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees.\n2. The variable window filter algorithm used in this project was optimised to delineate larger, native trees. As such, smaller (younger) trees and exotics such as Pinus radiata may be under-segmented.\n3. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights), there may still be errors present.",

    "description": "Welcome to the ACT Canopy Cover Map 2020\nThe following interactive map shows Canberra's tree canopy cover in 2020. Canberra's total 2020 tree canopy cover is estimated at 22.5%. The map uses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>). This canopy cover data product is available in the ACT Government's Open Data <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/\">Geospatial Catalogue</a> (<a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">available here</a>).\nCanopy coverage percentage is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m as detected by LiDAR to a 1m resolution (canopy polygons <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-all-districts/about\">available here</a>), divided by the area of a feature of interest such as a block, division or road polygon. The total tree canopy cover estimate for Canberra is based on the footprint of all urban divisions (suburbs).",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This issue of the Australian forest and wood products statistics (AFWPS) includes updated 2015-16 data for key domestic indicators of forestry sector activity, including sales and service income and industry valued added. It also includes interim estimates of the volume and value of logs harvested in 2016-17, along with updated 2016-17 trade statistics for wood products and data for housing and other residential commencements. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Forestry industry value added, or contribution to GDP, increased for the third year in a row, growing by 9 per cent to $8.6 billion in 2015-16. Sales and service income for the forestry sector also grew strongly to $23.7 billion in 2015-16 (up 7 per cent from the previous year). \r\n• ABARES estimates that Australia's forestry sector continued to grow strongly in 2016-17, with the total volume and value of logs harvested reaching record levels. Estimated total volume log harvest from native forests and commercial plantations increased by 9 per cent to 32.8 million cubic metres and estimated total value increased by 12 per cent to $2.5 billion. \r\n• After four consecutive years of growth in residential construction activity in Australia, dwelling commencements fell by 6 per cent to 219,300 in 2016-17. The decrease in commencements of other residential buildings (including units and house conversions) was greater than the decrease in house commencements. \r\n• Australia's trade in wood products has been growing since 2012-13 and reached a record level of $8.6 billion in 2016-17. The value of exports reached a record level of $3.4 billion (up 9 per cent from the previous year), while the value of imports fell to $5.3 billion (down 4 per cent from a record level in the previous year). \r\n• China was our largest trading partner in 2016-17 for wood products, accounting for over a quarter of Australia's total wood product imports, nearly half of total wood product exports and the majority of total wood products export growth over the year. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for beef producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Beef producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that had at least 100 head of beef cattle on hand at 30 June 2015. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Average total cash receipts for Australian beef farms increased by around 14 per cent in 2014-15 to $391 000 and by a similar percentage in the following year to around $442 000. \r\n• The increases in total cash receipts largely reflected higher receipts from cattle sales, which were largely a result of higher cattle prices. \r\n• In real terms, estimated average farm cash incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 are among the highest recorded since 2000-01. \r\n• Northern region beef farms recorded higher average farm incomes than farms in the Southern region in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. \r\n• Reflecting higher incomes, the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for beef farms increased from -0.1 per cent in 2013-14 to 0.6 per cent in 2014-15 and is estimated to increase further in 2015-16 to around 1.9 per cent. \r\n• Average beef farm debt trended upwards, in real terms, between 2000-01 and 2014-15. In 2014-15 average total debt was around $460 000 a farm. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of a rapid increase in average farm size. \r\n• However, increases in debt over time has largely been supported by an accompanying increase in the total capital value of beef farms. Consequently, average farm business equity ratios remained relatively steady over the period 2000-01 to 2015-16. \r\n",

    "description": "Mating signals are often directed at numerous senses, and provide information about species identity, gender, receptiveness, individual identity and mate quality. Given the diversity of colourful body patterns in invertebrates, surprisingly few studies have examined the role of these visual signals in mate recognition. This experiment demonstrates that distinct carapace colour patterns in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis, enable males to discriminate between their female neighbours and unfamiliar females.\n\nThe experiment was conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT from September to January 2003 and 2004. \n\nThe methodology involved identifying male and female U.capricornis neighbours living 10-30cm apart. The female was caught and randomly assigned to one of seven treatments, including replacement with a similar sized female, and various manipulations to alter her appearance. The female was then tethered close to the males burrow and the interaction monitored. The males behaviour was classified as either 'approach' or 'ignore.' The results show that males tended to approach unfamiliar females tethered nearby, whereas they were more likely to ignore their unaltered neighbours tethered in the same position.",

    "title": "Current values collected through the water column using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) in the centre of Jervis Bay: Winter Deployment",
    "description": "The record describes data collected from a winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored in the central part of Jervis Bay, New South Wales (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nTwo resources are provided in this record: 1) A schematic of depth bin location for the winter deployment and, 2) The raw, or unfiltered current values for each bin depth provided every 60 minutes in terms of east/west and north/south components.\n\nThis child record relates to the parent, c571bb80-2ae7-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Wine grape farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated wine grape farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on wine grape farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where most of the Basin's wine grapes are produced. Average farm cash incomes of wine grape farms rose from 2006-07 to 2011-12 before falling in 2012-13 in response to lower grape production. An increase in production contributed to slightly higher average farm cash incomes in 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n Grape crops in many areas of the Basin require regular irrigation because of the warm and relatively dry climate. From 2006-07 to 2014-15 the average volume of water used on wine grape farms mostly increased with this increase mainly due to an increase in average farm size. The proportion of grape farms using drip/trickle irrigation technologies has increased. \r\n\r\n The number of grape growers trading temporary water allocations varied from year to year. The years with the highest proportions of net buyers were 2007-08 and 2008-09. ",
