The upper\nreaches of the catchment are in the suburbs of Rockdale and Bexley and are principally\nresidential. It flows through a pipe network towards the Illawarra Railway Line. The railway\nline is raised above the natural ground level for a considerable distance either side of the main\npipe network under the line which may restrict surface flows from the western side.\nImmediately east of the railway line the catchment comprises a Commercial area along\nPrinces Highway and incorporates most-of the Rockdale City Centre.\nThe pipe conduit network combines into an open concrete trapezoidal section at Short Street,\nBanksia. The section downstream is through a low level residential area built fairly close to\nthe channel. As the channel continues past West Botany Street it flows through an open park\narea with some adjacent wetland areas. It eventually drains into the Cooks river at the\nconfluence of the Cooks River with Muddy Creek.\nMuddy Creek\nThe catchment area of Muddy Creek is about 5.6km2, its catchment area is heavily urbanised\nwith a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial development, and it drains into the\nCooks River near its entrance to Botany Bay. The residential development is mainly low\ndensity with some patches of medium to high density residential area consistent with urban\nconsolidation.\nMuddy Creek consists of a formed concrete channel from the Cooks River upstream to Frys\nReserve. There are a number of side channels, both open and piped, that laterally feed the\ntrunk flows into the creek. Upstream of Frys Reserve the trunk drainage system divides into a\nnumber of drainage systems combining open concrete channels with piped sections.\nThe section of Muddy Creek downstream of the Bestic Street bridge has been widened and\ndredged to form part of the lower Cooks River estuary. The tailwater level for Muddy Creek\nis controlled by the water level in the Cooks River.\nScarborough Ponds has a catchment area of about 4 km2 and a stream length of about 3.4 km.\nThere are three main ponds or wetlands, from England Street to President Avenue, from\nPresident Avenue to Barton Street, and downstream of Barton Street. The day-to-day water\nlevels of each pond are controlled at the downstream end by weirs at President Avenue,\nBarton Street and the outlet structure at Florence Street. The Florence Street outlet structure\nconnects the ponds to Botany Bay, allowing the tide to penetrate into the downstream ponds.\nThe Florence Street culvert consists of triple 1350 mm diameter pipes.\nDevelopment within the catchment is predominantly low to medium density residential\ndevelopment with localised commercial and industrial development. The areas adjacent to\nthe ponds have been landscaped into open spaces suitable for passive recreational activities.\nSome residential development on the eastern side of the ponds comes very close to the ponds.\nScarborough Ponds\nThe existing culvert under the railway line at Frys Reserve produces a throttling of the flows\nand causes Frys Reserve to act as an on-line retarding basin. The adjacent Warialda Street is\nexpected to be inundated in about a 20% AEP flood. Sydney Water has recently constructed\na new bypass culvert under the railway line to alleviate the hazard of floodwater through the\nHegarty Street underpass. The flood study examined flood behaviour for the original and\nnow existing culvert conditions under the railway line at Frys Reserve.\nThere are a large number of road and pedestrian bridges over Muddy Creek that may impact\non the flood behaviour. The major bridge crossings are at the Princes Highway, Bay Street and Bestic Street. In addition a sewer line crosses over Muddy Creek upstream of the Princes\nHighway. This sewer line would act as a major impediment to flood flows, ponding water\nagainst the concrete structure with no bypass arrangement. Some of the properties adjacent to\nthe creek have boundary fences located close to the Muddy Creek channel and these would\nimpact on flood flows by restricting the spread of water onto the floodplains.\nThe section of Muddy Creek downstream of the Bestic Street bridge has been widened and\ndredged to form part of the lower Cooks River estuary. The tailwater level for Muddy Creek\nis controlled by the water level in the Cooks River.\nScarborough Ponds\nScarborough Ponds has a catchment area of about 4 km2 and a stream length of about 3.4 km.\nThere are three main ponds or wetlands, from England Street to President Avenue, from\nPresident Avenue to Barton Street, and downstream of Barton Street. The day-to-day water\nlevels of each pond are controlled at the downstream end by weirs at President Avenue,\nBarton Street and the outlet structure at Florence Street. The Florence Street outlet structure\nconnects the ponds to Botany Bay, allowing the tide to penetrate into the downstream ponds.\nThe Florence Street culvert consists of triple 1350 mm diameter pipes.\nDevelopment within the catchment is predominantly low to medium density residential\ndevelopment with localised commercial and industrial development.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset contains the chemical and strontium isotope data of a selection of cores and cuttings from the Beetaloo Sub-basin, which were assessed from the core library of the Northern Territory Geological Survey. A total of 5 bores (Amungee NW-1, Beetaloo W1, BH 1, 12BC001, 12LE001) were sampled for either cuttings or parts of the core. The data showed that the aquifer variability for strontium isotopes is much higher than the groundwater variability (as expected) but also that waters in the CLA have a strontium isotope range that differs from the one of the aquifer rock. Furthermore the analyses allowed estimating the in-situ production of helium from radioactive decay of U and Th in the host rock and demonstrated that the high helium concentrations found in groundwater could not be produced within the aquifer itself but are due to fluid admixture from other (likely deeper) formations.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThese were analysed at the CSIRO Analytical Support Unit at Waite Campus for their elemental content by cation and Sr isotope analysis after digestion with Aqua Regia – for carbonate samples – or HF digestion – for samples with higher silicate contents such as basalts and sandstones below the CLA. Further elemental analysis, especially uranium and thorium analysis was performed using XRF analysis at CSIRO Mineral Resources.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the results of phytoplankton pigment composition analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network - National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. Pigment samples are taken for the complete water column (0-50m) and at the depths of the shallow WQM and the deeper WQM attached to the mooring at that site.\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

    "description": "We propose to monitor the bursts from the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst FRB 20240619D over six months using the Murriyang UWL receiver. The primary aim is to study the evolution of burst activity and polarization properties with frequency and time, and to discover any potential periodicity in the burst activity. These insights will enhance our understanding of the progenitor, emission physics, and the immediate magneto-ionic environment of FRB 20240619D, thereby informing the general FRB population. A total of 15 hours of observing between August and November 2024 resulted in over 1300 bursts detected using the UWL receiver. Some bursts exhibit complex spectro-temporal emission patterns. The burst rate, based on Murriyang and MeerKAT observations, indicates that the source was active until September 2nd, after which it became inactive. Given that two other repeating FRBs have exhibited periodic activity cycles, it is reasonable to expect that FRB 20240619D could become active again, making continued monitoring crucial. The UWL receiver's broad frequency coverage and sensitivity are essential for detecting many bursts and enabling simultaneous observations at different frequencies. This is important for understanding the burst activity evolution with time and frequency, spectral properties, and underlying emission mechanisms. The combination of sensitivity and wide bandwidth makes Murriyang the ideal telescope for monitoring this FRB. Results from these observations will be pivotal in understanding FRB 20240619D's place within the broader repeater population and its potential connection to broader FRB progenitor models.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "To return the Murray–Darling river system to health, the Murray–Darling Basin Plan requires recovery of surface water and groundwater for the environment. The government has prioritised infrastructure investment as its preferred method of water recovery. Read more about water programs in the Murray-Darling Basin here: <http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs>http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\nThis data set provides farm-level data on projects funded to recover water under the Basin Plan. Programs included are:\r\n\r\n* Commonwealth On-Farm Further Irrigation Efficiency Program (contributes to Efficiency Measures)\r\n\r\n* QLD Healthy Headwaters Water Use Efficiency Project\r\n\r\n* NSW Irrigated Farm Modernisation\r\n\r\n* NSW Basin Pipe\r\n\r\n* Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project Two\r\n\r\n* On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Operators Program in NSW\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Program for South Australia\r\n\r\n* South Australia River Murray Sustainability Program\r\n\r\n* Victorian Farm Modernisation Program\r\n\r\nFarm-level data is not available for the following programs:\r\n\r\n* Goulburn Murray Water Connections \r\n\r\n* NSW Metering Pilot\r\n\r\n* NSW Southern Valleys Metering Project\r\n\r\n* Sunraysia Modernisation Program\r\n\r\n##Exclusions\r\nPrograms that purchase water entitlements directly without associated infrastructure works are not included. Additionally, projects where a water entitlement has __not__ been returned to the Commonwealth, for example environmental projects, are also excluded.\r\n\r\n#Data field descriptions\r\n* Program: Text - Name of program under which the on-farm works were funded.\r\n\r\n* Round: Numerical or text - Funding round under which on-farm works were funded. Text fields generally refer to \"Not applicable\" where the program did not have funding rounds, or \"Pilot\" where funding was provided under a pilot arrangement.\r\n\r\n* Delivery partner: Text - The organisation contracted to deliver the program on behalf of the Australian Government. These organisations are responsible for day-to-day management of on-farm projects, and have the contract with the farmer.\r\n\r\n* Project identifier: Numerical or text - An identifier for each project unique to that program. \r\n\r\n* Australian Government project funding (GST exclusive): Currency - Australian dollars - Australian Government Project Funding excludes both GST payments and administration components of funding. Project values may change over time as the project is finalised and subject to final audit and acquittal.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML nominal): Numeric - Megalitres - Water transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Total water savings may exceed those returned to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML LTAAY): Numeric - Megalitres in LTAAY terms - LTAAY stands for Long Term Average Annual Yield, which is a method used to standardise the calculation of expected water recoveries in the Murray–Darling Basin from different water access entitlement categories and across catchments in the Basin. This measure of water volume is relevant for measuring progress of water recovery towards meeting the sustainable diversion limits set out in the Basin Plan. The average annual yield for Murray-Darling Basin resource units is calculated using the current long-term diversion limit equivalent factors (v2.05) agreed by the Ministerial Council in November 2011, or in the absence of a factor, is modelled by the MDBA in consultation with the States. Following accreditation of the Water Resource Plans for an area, the planning assumptions used within will determine the LTAAY. \r\n\r\n* Water entitlement class: Text - The type of water that was transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Water entitlements are perpetual or ongoing entitlement to exclusive access to a share of water from a specified consumptive pool as defined in the relevant water plan. The nature and names for water entitlements differ across the Murray-Darling Basin. Further information is available at: <http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml>http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml.\r\n\r\n* State: Text - State from which the water entitlement was sourced.\r\n\r\n* SDL Resource Unit: Text - The geographical location from which the water entitlement was sourced, based on information provided by the delivery partner. Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) Resource Units are defined in legislation and available at <https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160>https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160.\r\n\r\n* Description of project: Text - Description of on-farm works undertaken. This field has been edited to ensure that it has been appropriately de-identified consistent with our obligations under the _Privacy Act 1988_.\r\n\r\n* Project  commencement date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project commenced. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as the date Funding Agreement with the Delivery Partner was signed.\r\n\r\n* Project completion date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project was completed. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as approval date of final activity report, sub-project type closure report or closure letter. Not all projects have been completed at the time of producing this report.\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer: The Australian Government acting through the Department of Agriculture has exercised due care and skill in preparing and compiling this data. In some instances, the department has relied on the delivery agent - which is responsible for the management and implementation of the program (and has the contract with the individual farmer) - to prepare the data. Notwithstanding, the Department of Agriculture, its employees and advisers disclaim all liability, including liability for negligence and for any loss, damage, injury, expense or cost incurred by any person as a result of accessing, using or relying on any of the data to the maximum extent permitted by law._",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

The data spans the months of 2012 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis Asset Database v1.0 on 03 August 2015 is original preliminary Asset Database\n\n\n\nThe Asset database is registered to the BA repository as an ESRI personal goedatabase (.mdb - doubling as a MS Access database) that can store, query, and manage non-spatial data while the spatial data is in a separate file geodatabase joined by AID/ElementID. \n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. A report on the WAIT process for the Hunter is included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Hunter subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. \n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_201500803.doc\", located in this filet.\n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.\n\n\n\nDetailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"SSB_asset_database_doc_201500803.doc\" located in this file.\n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1.0\t3/08/2015\tInitial database.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 03 August 2015.

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

The dynamics of this area and the relationship between ocean circulation, chemistry and sediments control the larval species and the higher marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.  \n\nThe data from this site provide linking observations between the Southern Ocean and NSW through processes that occur on weekly to El Nino time scales.  \n\nThe BONC HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Nora Creina (37.329 S 139.850 E) and Blackfellows Cave (37.940 S 140.457 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km\nand a range resolution of 3 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in March 2017.",

    "description": "The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The experiment was part of a larger study looking at the relationship between neighbouring males and females in this species. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin. Fieldwork was conducted yearly in 18 plots (4mx4m) from November-January in 2002-2006.\n\nAll individuals within the plots were caught and carapace widths measured. This allowed the sex ratio in relation to size to be determined. The location of burrows were also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\nResults indicate that an average of 7 crabs per square metre were active on the surface at any time. The sex ratio was strongly male biased, with only 30% of crabs being female. The sex ratio also changed with size; females were significantly rarer in large size classes.",

    "description": "The&nbsp;<strong>AusAEM, Northeast Queensland, Australia, 2024 Airborne Electromagnetic Survey</strong>&nbsp;was a collaborative effort between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ). Conducted between July and October 2024, the survey covered 30,500 flight-line kilometres at a nominal line spacing of 20 kilometres, with selected infill as part of GA's Data Driven Discoveries project in the Adavale . The primary aim was to gather comprehensive airborne electromagnetic and magnetic geophysical data to better understand subsurface geological formations, contributing to mineral exploration, groundwater studies, and broader geological mapping in North-east Queensland. \n\n\n\nThe survey was flown by Xcalibur Aviation (Australia) Pty Ltd using its TEMPEST AEM system. Xcalibur also processed the data. This data package includes the acquisition and processing report, the final processed AEM data, and the results of the contractor's conductivity-depth estimates. \n\n\n\nThe survey will become part of the national AusAEM airborne electromagnetic acquisition programme, which aims to provide geophysical information to support investigations of the regional geology and groundwater system and better characterise the salinity, recharge and architecture of the aquifers within the upper few hundred metres of the subsurface.

    "description": "Storage Volumes:\nThe modelling showed that the approach developed for Terrigal and Wamberal Lagoons could be satisfactorily applied to Avoca Lagoon for the opening of 14 September 1993. In discussions with Paterson Consultants it became apparent that the storage volume of the Lagoon was critical for establishing the peak outflow from the Lagoon. A considerable effort was undertaken in this regard which revealed that a table of height/area of Avoca Lagoon was in error at a level of I.0 m. In addition it was determined that the Mike-II and RUBICON models determine different storage capacities of the lagoon. There was insufficient time to completely resolve this issue, however preliminary work suggested that the Mike- 11 model was over-calculating storage. The differences in storage make no significant difference to the peak flood level.\nComparison of Results:\nFor Wamberal, Avoca and Cockrone Lagoons the peak flood levels from both approaches should be very similar. This is because the berm height is the major control and the peak flood level is only just (0.3m) above the berm level. For Terrigal Lagoon the differences in the two approaches are likely to be more significant as the beach berm is much lower (2.5m AHD) and the peak flood level approximately 0.5m higher than the berm.\nAdditional Work:\nIt is recommended that data be collected for future openings. If the data are suitable they should be used in further verification of the hydraulic models.",

The data covers the years of 2006-2015 and is aggregated by Local Government Areas (LGA) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard. This dataset is part of the Victorian Department of Education and Training's Victorian Child and Adolescent Monitoring System (VCAMS) data release. This dataset is sourced from the Student Attitudes to School Survey.\nThe VCAMS Framework comprises 150 indicators as agreed by the Children's Service Coordination Board. It incorporates 35 outcomes that relate to aspects of children's health, development, safety, learning and well-being in four categories - the child, families, community, and supports and services.\nFor more information, please visit VCAMS Indicators.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"NDP\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n",

Waterways (Reach) Rectification project undertaken 2001 to 2003 to review and correct the extent of the waterways reach network to ensure a complete data set exists (using the Drainage Metropolis Boundary, 50K data, 1:2500 Drainage Record Plans, Drainage Limits data, orthophotos, as constructed and/or design drawings, contour data and Melway Street Directory). Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in GIS and Hansen (AMIS) for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for start / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length that are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated in 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10 using Lidar survey data (contours).

    "description": "Geoscience Australia carried out a marine survey on Carnarvon shelf (WA) in 2008 (SOL4769) to map seabed bathymetry and characterise benthic environments through colocated sampling of surface sediments and infauna, observation of benthic habitats using underwater towed video and stills photography, and measurement of ocean tides and wavegenerated currents. Data and samples were acquired using the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) Research Vessel Solander. Bathymetric mapping, sampling and video transects were completed in three survey areas that extended seaward from Ningaloo Reef to the shelf edge, including: Mandu Creek (80 sq km); Point Cloates (281 sq km), and; Gnaraloo (321 sq km). Additional bathymetric mapping (but no sampling or video) was completed between Mandu creek and Point Cloates, covering 277 sq km and north of Mandu Creek, covering 79 sq km. Two oceanographic moorings were deployed in the Point Cloates survey area. The survey also mapped and sampled an area to the northeast of the Muiron Islands covering 52 sq km. north2_3m is an ArcINFO grid centre of Mandu of Carnarvon Shelf survey area produced from the processed EM3002 bathymetry data using the CARIS HIPS and SIPS software. This dataset is a contribution to the CERF Marine Biodiversity Hub.",

    "description": "This data was used in the manuscript 'Genomic selection for genotype performance and stability using information on multiple traits and multiple environments' by J. Bancic, B. Ovenden, G. Gorjanc and D.J. Tolhurst. \nThis paper develops a single-stage genomic selection (GS) approach which incorporates information on multiple traits and multiple environments within a partially separable factor analytic framework. The factor analytic linear mixed model is an effective method for analysing multi-environment trial (MET) datasets, but is yet to be extended to GS for multiple traits and multiple environments. The advantage of using all sources of information is that breeders can utilise genotype by environment by trait interaction (GETI) to obtain more accurate predictions across correlated traits and environments. The partially separable factor analytic linear mixed model (SFA-LMM) developed in this paper is based on a three-way separable structure, which includes a factor analytic matrix between traits, a factor analytic matrix between environments and a genomic relationship matrix between genotypes. An additional specific variance matrix is then added to enable a different genotype by environment interaction (GEI) pattern for each trait and a different genotype by trait interaction (GTI) pattern for each environment. The results show that the SFA-LMM and all other factor analytic linear mixed models provide a better fit than the completely separable approaches. Selection from the SFA-LMM is then demonstrated using a selection index based on measures of genotype performance and stability. This research represents an important continuation in the advancement of plant breeding analyses, particularly with the advent of high-throughput phenotypic datasets involving a very large number of traits and environments.\nThese datasets include the phenotypic data, marker data and genomic relationship matrix used in the analysis. Phenotypic data includes grain yield, days to flowering, mature plant height and grain protein. Marker data was derived from Diversity Arrays next generation sequencing (DArTSeq).\nThis research was conducted as collaboration between The Roslin Institute (University of Edinburgh) and the Australian Rice Breeding Program. The Australian Rice Breeding Program is funded under the Australian Rice Partnership II project, a partnership between NSW Department of Primary Industries, AgriFutures and SunRice. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2017 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains polygon, line shapefiles and point representing three Hunter terrestrial and riverine Landscape Classes respectively. The polygon and line shapefiles are provided in as both multipart and singlepart versions.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe terrestrial Landscape class polygons are sourced directly from input polygon source datasets and clipped to the Hunter PAE (which is the same as the subregion boundary).\n\n\n\nGDE landscape classes derive directly from the source NSW OoW GDE layer's Keith Form attribute, though the \"Riverine Forests\" Keith Forms are combined with the \"Forested Wetlands\" LC and the \"Mangrove Swamps\" and \"Saltmarshes\" Keith Forms are from this source are not used .  Rather \"Saline Wetlands\" and \"Seagrass\" LCs are sourced from the Marcophytes input source data. The remaining LCs in the River and Estuarine LC_Group are sourced from the NSW_Wetlands 2006 data.\n\n\n\nThe Economic Landuse LC_Group terrestrial LC polygons are mainly sourced from the ACLUM catchment landuse from the PRIMARY V7 classification, and retain the source class names except that  \"1 Conservation and natural environments\" is renamed the \"non-GDE Native Vegtation\" LC.  A further exception  is the \"Plantation and Production Forestry\" LC. This is derived from the SECONDARY_V7 classification where:\n\n\n\n\"SecondV7\" = '2.2 Production forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '3.1 Plantation forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '4.1 Irrigated plantation forestry'\n\n\n\nthe 4 input polygon layers were formatted and UNIONed. Where there was overlap the Landscape class was taken in the following order of precedence:\n\n\n\n1 DPI Estuarine Macrophytes (for Saline wetlands and Seagrass LCs)\n\n2 OoW GDE mapping (for GDE group LCs)\n\n3 NSW Wetlands 2006 (for remaining Coastal Lakes and Estuaries Group LCs)\n\n4 ACLUM 2014 (for Plantation and production forestry LC)\n\n5 GHM Vegetation mapping ( for nonGDE Native vegetation LC)\n\n6 ACLUM 2014 (for remaining Economic group LCs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Riverine LC lines are derived directly from the Perreniality source dataset.\n\n\n\nThe point Spring Landscape classes are sourced from the Assets database where the centroids of the 4 Spring Asset polygons were taken.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) HUN Landscape Classification v02.

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises data on the distribution and abundance of seabirds in the Southern Indian Ocean.\n\nA database of seal, whale and bird observations made from ships since the 1978/1979 austral summer shipping season. Observations are typically made from the bridge out one side of the ship. Data held in this database greater than two years old are publicly available. This work forms part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\n\nInitial datasets were from the BIOMASS cruises (ADBEX1,ADBEX2,ADBEX3, SIBEX, FIBEX).\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 2208 (ASAC 2208).\n\nThis project also incorporates several other ASAC projects.  These are:\n\nASAC_533 - The Distribution and Abundance of Seabirds at Sea in Prydz Bay in Relation to Physical and Biological Parameters\nASAC_657 - Prey Consumption by Seabirds around Heard Island in Relation to Physical and Biological Oceanographic Parameters\nASAC_725 - The role of the marginal ice zone in the consumption of marine resources by Antarctic seabirds in the Southern Indian Ocean\nASAC_1219 - Monitoring for long-term or cumulative impacts in Southern Ocean seabirds\n\nData from these projects were fed directly into project 2208.\n\nThe fields in the csv file are:\n\nwov_data_id (the internal identifier of the record)\nobservation_date (the date of observation, in ISO8601 format yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ.

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The 2016-17 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2016-17 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n*  PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n*  Selected tables from Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night). \r\n\r\nData from the 2016-17 Budget is provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2016-17 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV__\r\n\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes. Only table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX is available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n*  Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n*  Table 1.2: Entity 2016-17 Budget Measures;\r\n*  Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX;\r\n*  Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n*  Table 3.1.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n*  Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2016-17 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).\r\n\r\nDifferences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.  Intra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2.  Entity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3.  Additional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts. \r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n*  Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2015-16\r\n* 2016-17\r\n* 2017-18\r\n* 2018-19\r\n* 2019-20\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe data transformation is expected to be complete by midday, 4 May 2016. The following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n*  Agriculture and Water Resources\r\n*  Attorney-General's\r\n*  Communication and the Arts\r\n*  Defence\r\n*  Education and Training\r\n*  Employment\r\n*  Environment\r\n*  Finance\r\n*  Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n*  Health\r\n*  Human Services\r\n*  Immigration and Border Protection\r\n*  Industry and Science\r\n*  Infrastructure and Regional Development\r\n*  Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n*  Social Services\r\n*  Human Services\r\n*  Treasury\r\n*  Veterans' Affairs\r\n*  Department of the House of Representatives\r\n*  Department of the Senate\r\n*  Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n*  Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\n__Budget Paper Tables__\r\n\r\nThe list below shows the data tables from the Budget Papers which are available in Excel and CSV formats.\r\n\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix C Major Intiatives\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix D Major Savings\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 3 - Table 5: Reconciliation of underlying cash balance estimates\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 1: Australian Government general government receipts\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 7: Australian Government general government (cash) receipts\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 9: Reconciliation of 2015 16 general government (accrual) revenue\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 5 – Table 3: Estimates of expenses by function\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 1: Australian Government general government sector receipts, payments, net Future Fund earnings and underlying cash balance\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 3: Australian Government general government sector taxation receipts, non taxation receipts and total receipts\r\n*  Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 4: Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments\r\n*  Budget Paper 4 Table 1.1 – Agency Resourcing\r\n*  Budget Paper 4 Table 1.2 – Special Appropriations\r\n*  Budget Paper 4 Table 1.3 – Special Accounts\r\n*  Budget Paper 4 Table 2.2 – Staffing Tables\r\n*  Budget Paper 4 Table 3.1 – Departmental Expenses\r\n*  Budget Paper 4 Table 3.2 – Net Capital Investment\r\n\r\n__Change Log__\r\n\r\n1.  03/05/2016 – datasets first published\r\n2.  04/05/2016 – updated 2016-17 Line Items Dataset to include the Australian War Memorial, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Australian Research Council.

    "description": "The ISC2010_FRAGMENTATION polygon features represent gap areas in vegetation cover in the 40m Riparian Zone (defined as 40m from ISC2010_STREAMBED_WIDTH) . The gap crietria is defined as any area where vegetation cover is less than 20% for at least 10m x 10m. This data set is derived from source Fractional Cover raster data and has been clipped to a 40m buffer of Stream Bed. Small polygons (&lt;10m2) resulting from the clip process have been excluded from the Fragmentation feature class.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the WA public sector report 2015 - Creating opportunities is the employee perception survey (EPS). \r\n\r\nThe EPS captures employee views about factors affecting their workplace, such as leadership, communication, work/life balance and performance development. This information helps to understand organisational culture across the public sector and is essential in identifying areas for further consideration and acknowledging good practice. \r\n\r\nThe EPS is typically conducted in each public sector body with more than 20 employees once every five years. Different regional offices for the largest agencies, Department of Health and Department of Education, are surveyed every year. To improve the representativeness of the sample, entities are selected across a range of sizes and portfolios. However, care should be taken in interpreting the EPS results because the sample may not be entirely representative of the broader public sector.\r\n\r\nIn June 2015, all employees in 20 public sector entities were asked to complete the survey (including two areas from the Department of Health and one from the Department of Education). The average response rate to the survey was 31%, with 11 405 valid responses received.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2015.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant employees to access online or in hardcopy\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2015 data.xls – individual responses to the EPS, with a question key and response key. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2015 data.sav – individual responses to the EPS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\nFurther information about the EPS sample and summary results for 2015 are available in the State of the WA public sector statistical bulletin 2015.\r\n",

The current record can be found here: https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/lake-macquarie-lga-vegetation-community-map-2022-vis_id-5117\nLake Macquarie City Council Working Composite Vegetation Community Map undertaken by Stephen Bell and Colin Driscoll\nfrom 2008 - 2013. A staged approach has been adopted by Council, to allow for funding as it becomes available. Stage 1 of the project focused on the Wyee to Cooranbong portion of the LGA, while Stage 2 examined the Glendale–Bolton Point–Seahampton area. Stage 5 focused on the north-eastern area of the City, extending north from Belmont in the south, and adjoining the Stage 2 area near Glendale. Stages 4 and 6 have not yet commenced. In total, approximately 46,270 ha have been included within Stages 1-3 and 5.  Previous classification and mapping studies have also been amalgamated to form the basis of a city-wide vegetation map, which will be progressively amended and improved as further funding becomes available. Both mapping projects adopt the LHCCREMS 2000 vegetation classification as their structural framework, but with updated sub-community and new community allocations informed through preliminary regional multivariate data analysis undertaken for unrelated projects elsewhere in the region. VIS_ID 2307\nMap footprint supplied only. Contact Lake Macquarie Council for access to the vegetation map.",

    "description": "##Description\r\nThis dataset shows the annual landed catch (meaning the catch that is landed at port) in kilograms, by species and fishery, for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \r\nThese data come from AFMA catch disposal records (CDRs), and have been recorded and submitted to AFMA by commercial fishers and fish receiver permit holders when fish are landed at port. Fish discarded at sea are not included in CDRs and therefore are not included in this dataset. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThese annual catches are calculated from the date the fish was landed at a port. This means that comparisons with other datasets with different summations (for example, catch by fishing season or catch from the date the fish were removed from the ocean) may produce different results.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect catches each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as: total allowable catch, closures of fishing areas, reducing boat numbers, or banning the catch of a particular species. Similarly, changes in market demand can affect which species are targeted. \r\nCDRs are used to monitor quota (see Individual Transferable Quota)). AFMA total allowable catches (TAC)s are set for fishing seasons rather than calendar years. See catchwatch for seasonal catch to date compared to TAC for AFMA’s larger quota fisheries. Not all fisheries have CDRs, and in some fisheries the CDR program was started part-way through an annual time-period.\r\nThese catch disposal record data do not include catch by gear type. This information can be found in the “Reported landed annual catch from Commonwealth fisheries logbooks” and its metadata, which is published on data.gov.au. Note that catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only that have been recorded by fishers while at sea. It is used in combination with gear, effort, and spatial data from logbooks to inform stock assessments. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers and fish receivers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness, and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "The ISC2010_STRUCTURE2_R table is the Statistical Summary table for the Structure2 Metric at the Reach level. Structure 2 represents vertical vegetation layering or structure and considers 6 height intervals: 1.5m to 5m, 5m to 10m, 10m to 15m, 15m to 20m, 20m to 25m and &gt;25m. Structure 2 is assessed within the 40m riparian zone.\n\nThe ISC2010_STRUCTURE2_R table is designed to JOIN to the ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINES_R feature class.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple datasets. The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis Assessment Units dataset is a 1000 \\* 1000 m vector polygon ('vector grid') dataset that was extracted from the BA-wide vector-based box polygons generated over all the BA subregions and aligned to the kilometer marks to ensure grid cell edges fall exactly on the whole kilometer. The BA-wide assessment units dataset ensures unique identifiers for each assessment unit. This particular grid is intended for use in the NAM Subregion only and it covers the area that is 20 km greater than the Namoi analysis extent which is the combined Namoi Preliminary Assessment Extent (PAE) and the Namoi subregional boundary. It was derived to perfectly align with the interpolated groundwater model results produced by the BA Namoi groundwater model. The unique ID field for each vector polygon tile is stored in both the AUID (text) field and the au500_id (integer) field. The dataset is in Australia Albers (GDA94) (EPSG 3577).\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe purpose of the assessment units are to assist with the spatial and statistical analysis of the potential impact of coal resource development on assets and landscape classes in Namoi. They achieve this by enabling multi-scaled data to be used in the analysis while respecting the scale and associated uncertainties of the regional scale groundwater, surface water and receptor impact modelling. For Namoi, that scale is 1000 \\* 1000 m. The division of the data into assessment units also support the rapid querying, assembly and display of data in GIS and web-based interfaces.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis Assessment Units dataset is a 1000 \\* 1000 m vector polygon ('vector grid') dataset that was extracted from the BA-wide vector-based box polygons generated over all the BA subregions and aligned to the kilometer marks to ensure grid cell edges fall exactly on the whole kilometer.

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the Port Phillip and Westernport CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the Port Phillip and Westernport Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. This assembly of information suggests that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~130cm depth. The smallest size fraction (<100µm) dominates at all depths, with the shallowest sample (5cm) exhibiting 93% of material within this size range.",

    "description": "We request time to observe 270 pulsars on a regular basis in order to achieve three main science goals. The first is to understand pulsars: how do they spin down and what disrupts this process, how and why their profiles vary with time, whether they precess or have planetary mass companions, in short all the things that make pulsar timing noisier than the perfect clock. Secondly we want to understand the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through repeated monitoring of dispersion measure, rotation measure and flux density variations in conjunction with scintillation parameters. Finally, we provide these data as a community service both to the high-energy community where we have strong collaborative links (particularly to Fermi) and to the radio pulsar astronomers generally through the CSIRO archive. The project is on-going since 2007, we are (co-)authors on 106 papers arising from the P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of students from Bordeaux, Manchester, Oxford, Stanford, and Swinburne. We are seeking long-term project status with a view to continuing the project into the SKA era.",

    "description": "The VEGETATION_WIDTH_R table is the Statistical Summary table for the Vegetation Width Metric at the Reach level.\n\nThe ISC2010_VEGETATION_WIDTH_R table is designed to JOIN to the ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINES_R feature class.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "This study investigated the ecology of caridean shrimp in eelgrass habitats in Western Port Bay, Victoria from July 1977 to January 1980. The study sites were located on the Churchill Tidal Flats on the northern side of Phillip Island, which are dominated by the eelgrass species, Heterozostera tasmanica and the cardiean shrimp species, Macrobrachium intermedium, Pontophilus candidus, Hippolyte caradina and Chlorotocella leptorhyncus. Benthic trawls were used to sample the shrimp populations at an offshore (Site A) and inshore (Site B) eelgrass site. Another site on a mudflat (Site C) was sampled to determine the movement patterns of shrimps between the mudflats and adjacent subtidal eelgrass areas. Sampling was undertaken every 1 to 2 months at night time during high tide. Plankton tows were used to monitor the presence of larval stages of shrimp in the water column. Details of each experiment and results are described in the related records.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the geological architecture and sedimentary fill of the Cenozoic Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in order to provide a basis for conceptualising its hydrogeology. Petroleum well data was used as a primary source of information as a large number of wells have been drilled in the region and geophysical well logs are run as part of the exploration process. These logs can provide information on distribution of lithologies downhole.   The study was divided into two parts:  1. From petroleum well data (principally Gamma Ray well log and mudlogs) Pick key stratigraphic horizons in the Lake Eyre Basin, namely the Namba Formation and Eyre Formation in South Australia and if possible their equivalents in Queensland, the Glendower Formation. The Whitula Formation, present in the northern part of the study area in Queensland, was not differentiated in this part of the study.  2. Understand the distribution of sand and shale in the various formations using models of lithology based on normalised gamma Ray log cut-offs.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset was compiled by GBA project staff for stage 3 reports.\r\nRefer to Fact sheet 21 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba.",

    "description": "Objective\nThis Floodplain Management Study defines the nature and extent of the flood hazard in the three\ncatchments. It also identifies and assesses strategies and measures aimed at reducing the impact\nof flooding on both existing and future development, and measures to prevent future development\nfrom making flooding worse.\nThe results of this Floodplain Management Study are being used to prepare a Floodplain\nManagement Plan (FPMP). The objective of the FPMP is to establish a cost-effective floodplain\nmanagement strategy for the area and to recommend a programme for implementation of the Plan.\nThe Study Brief is attached as Appendix A.\nWhat is in the Study\nThe Floodplain Management Study and Plan will not totally eliminate flooding. Flooding is a natural\nphenomenon which cannot be fully controlled by human works. In fact, excessive artificial controls\nare likely to be very costly and to have adverse environmental effects. Therefore the Floodplain\nManagement Study and Plan aim to provide a package of best management practices which give a\nbalance between reducing flood hazard and flood damages, allowing appropriate development, and\nprotecting and enhancing the environment of the floodplain.\nThis Report has been divided into the following sections:\n\nSection 1: Introduction (page 1)\nEstablishes the context and basis for the plan.\nSection 2: Background (page 5)\nDescribes the study process, including previous studies, and the background technical\ninformation which is available. It includes a review of the previous Muddy Creek Flood\nStudies.\nSection 3: Existing Flood Behaviour (page 15)\nSummarises the available data and modelling results concerning flood behaviour.\nSection 4: Social and Economic Impacts of Flooding (page 23)\nExamines the potential flood damages and other social and economic effects of flooding for a\nrange of flood events, including an extreme flood.\nSection 5: Choosing the Designated Flood (page 28)\nDiscusses the issued to be considered by Council in choosing a designated flood for\nRockdale, and recommends that the 1% AEP flood be adopted.\nSection 6: Available Floodplain Management Options (page 35)\nDescribes in broad terms the range of flood mitigation and other management works and\nother measures available to address the existing, future and residual flooding problems in the\nstudy area.\nSections 7, 8 and 9: Options for Management Areas (page 48)\nThese three sections describe in detail, for the Muddy Creek, Spring St Drain and\nScarborough Ponds catchments respectively, the feasible options and their likely benefits and\ncosts.\nSection 10: Assessment of Management Options (page 86)\nReviews the financial aspects and the justification for the proposed management measures,\nidentifies priorities and possible sources of funding. These issues will be further addressed in\nthe future Floodplain Management Plan.\nSection 11: References (page 90)\nTechnical detail which supports the main report is provided in the Appendices, in Volume 2.\n",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>buffalo fly</strong> model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

The data spans the months of 2014 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated cotton</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 10 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",
