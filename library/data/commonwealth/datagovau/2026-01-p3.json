    "title": "Benthic survey of Dugong and Turtle seagrass habitats in the North-West Torres Strait for November 2015 and January 2016 (NESP TWQ 3.5, TropWATER, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset summarises benthic surveys of seagrass for Dugong and Turtle habitats in the North-West Torres Strait for November 2015 and January 2016.  The Site data describes seagrass at 853 sites; while the Meadow data describes seagrass at 34 individual meadows.  The data includes information on seagrass species, biomass, diversity, and BMI and algae percent cover.  The dataset is available as shapefiles, GIS layer packages, and/or a CSV file.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nThe sampling methods used to study, describe and monitor seagrass meadows were developed by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and tailored to the location and habitat surveyed; these are described in detail in the relevant publications (https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater). \n\n1. Location - Latitude and longitude was recorded by GPS at each site. Depth was recorded when sampling by boat and converted to depth below mean sea level (dbMSL) in metres.\n\n2 Seagrass metrics - Above-ground biomass was determined using a ¿visual estimates of biomass¿ technique (Mellors, 1991) using trained observers. A linear regression was calculated for the relationship between the observer ranks and the harvested values. This regression was used to calculate above-ground biomass for all estimated ranks made from the survey sites. Biomass ranks were then converted into above-ground biomass estimates in grams dry weight per square metre (gdw m-2). Observers ranked seagrass biomass, and the percent contribution of each species to that biomass, using video transects, grabs, free divers, and helicopter:\n* Video transect: Commonly used for subtidal meadows sampled from larger boats. At each transect site an underwater CCTV camera system was lowered from the vessel to the bottom. For each transect the camera was towed at drift speed (less than one knot) for approximately 100m. Footage was observed on a TV monitor and digitally recorded. The video was paused at ten random time frames and an observer ranked seagrass biomass and species composition. On completion of the video analysis, the video observer ranked five additional quadrats that had been previously videoed for calibration. These quadrats were videoed in front of a stationary camera, then harvested, dried and weighed. \n* Helicopter: Commonly used for intertidal surveys. At each site seagrass above-ground biomass and species composition were estimated from three 0.25 m2 quadrats placed randomly within a 10m2 circular area. Seagrass percent cover and sediment type were recorded at each site. The ¿visual estimates of biomass¿ technique when applied to helicopter surveys (and free diving/camera drops ¿ see below) involves ranking while referring to a series of quadrat photographs of similar seagrass habitats for which the above-ground biomass has previously been measured. Three separate biomass scales were used: low-biomass, high-biomass, and Enhalus-biomass. The relative proportion (percentage) of the above-ground biomass of each seagrass species within each survey quadrat was also recorded. Field biomass ranks were converted into above-ground biomass estimates in grams dry weight per square metre (gdw m-2). At the completion of sampling each observer ranked a series of calibration quadrats as per video transect surveys.\n* Camera drop/free diving: Commonly used for shallow subtidal meadows sampled from a small boat. Sampling follows the same protocol as helicopter surveys but the three quadrats were either assessed by a free diver with quadrat, or by an underwater CCTV camera system camera attached to a frame. Video footage was observed on a TV monitor and seagrass ranked in real time, with the camera frame serving as a quadrat.\n* van Veen grab: Commonly used for shallow subtidal meadows sampled from a small boat in conjunction with camera drops, or to record seagrass presence/absence where visibility was too poor for camera drops. A sample of seagrass was collected using a van Veen grab (grab area 0.0625 m2) to identify species present at each site. Species identified from the grab sample were used to inform species composition assessments made from the video drops (Kuo et al., 1989).\n\n3 Benthic macro-invertebrates - A visual estimate of benthic macro-invertebrate (BMI) percent cover was recorded at each shallow subtidal and intertidal site according to four broad taxonomic groups:\n* Hard corals ¿ All scleractinian corals including massive, branching, tabular, digitate and mushroom.\n* Soft corals ¿ All alcyonarian corals, i.e. corals lacking a hard limestone skeleton.\n* Sponges\n* Other BMI ¿ Any other BMI identified, e.g. hydroids, ascidians, barnacles, oysters, molluscs. Other BMI are listed in the ¿comments¿ column of the GIS site layer.\n\n4 Algae - A visual estimate of algae percent cover was recorded at each shallow subtidal and intertidal site. When present, algae were categorised into five functional groups and the percent contribution of each functional group was estimated:\n* Erect macrophytes ¿ Macrophytic algae with an erect growth form and high level of cellular differentiation, e.g. Sargassum, Caulerpa and Galaxaura species.\n* Erect calcareous ¿ Algae with erect growth form and high level of cellular differentiation containing calcified segments, e.g. Halimeda species.\n* Filamentous ¿ Thin, thread-like algae with little cellular differentiation.\n* Encrusting ¿ Algae that grows in sheet-like form attached to the substrate or benthos, e.g. coralline algae.\n* Turf mat ¿ Algae that forms a dense mat on the substrate.\n\n\nFormat: \n\nThis dataset consists of two (2) GIS layers: a Site layer and a Meadow layer.\n\n1. Site layer\nThis layer contains data collected at 853 individual survey sites mapped in 2015-2016, and includes:\n* Temporal details - survey date and time.\n* Spatial details ¿ latitude/longitude, dbMSL, sediment type, NRM region, site depth (depth below mean sea level, m).\n* Habitat information ¿ seagrass presence absence, dominant seagrass species, presence/absence of individual species, seagrass above-ground biomass (for each species), Shannon-Weaver seagrass diversity values, dugong feeding trail presence/absence (intertidal sites only), and percent cover for seagrass, algae groups and benthic macro-invertebrates.\n* Sampling methods, any relevant comments, and data custodian.\n\nThis layer is presented as five (5) alternate layer packages based on symbology from specific columns:\n* Seagrass presence/absence (Torres Strait seagrass present absent NESP 2015.lpk)\n* Seagrass species composition (Torres Strait seagrass species composition NESP 2015.lpk)\n* Dugong feeding trail presence absence (Torres Strait dugong feeding trail presence absence NESP 2015.lpk) (Note: this layer only includes site information for intertidal helicopter surveys)\n* Algae cover (Torres Strait algae cover NESP 2015.lpk)\n* Benthic macro-invertebrate cover (Torres Strait benthic macro-invertebrate cover NESP 2015.lpk)\n\n\n2. Meadow layer\nSeagrass presence/absence site data was used to construct the polygon (meadow) layer. The meadow layer provides summary information for all sites within the meadow, and includes:\n* Spatial details ¿ depth range of sites and meadow location.\n* Habitat information ¿ seagrass species present, meadow community type and density, mean meadow biomass + standard error (s.e.), meadow area + reliability estimate (R) and number of sites within the meadow. \n* Sampling methods and any relevant comments.\n\nThis layer is presented as three (3) alternate layer packages, including interpolation layers which were created using site data and meadow boundaries to describe spatial variation in biomass, species diversity and depth gradients.  The layers are:\n* \"Torres Strait meadow community type NESP 2015.lpk\" - Includes 34 individual seagrass meadows mapped in  2015-2016 with information including individual meadow ID, meadow location (intertidal/shallow subtidal/subtidal), meadow density based on mean biomass, meadow area, dominant seagrass species, seagrass species present, survey dates, survey method, and data custodian. ESRI and Landsat satellite image basemaps were used as background source data to check meadow and site boundaries, and re-map where required.\n* \"Torres Strait biomass (g dw m-2) interpolation NESP 2015.lpk\" - An inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) was applied to seagrass site data to describe spatial variation in biomass across each meadow and throughout the north-west Torres Strait region. \n* \"Torres Strait Shannon Weaver diversity interpolation NESP 2015.lpk\" - An inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) was applied to seagrass site data to describe spatial variation in seagrass species diversity across each meadow and throughout the north-west Torres Strait region. The Shannon-Weaver index is a mathematical measure of species diversity that uses species richness (the number of species present, where a score of 0 = one species present) and the relative abundance of different species (Spellerberg et al., 2003).\n\n\nData Dictionary:\n* Meadow location was classed according to whether meadows were intertidal (all sites surveyed by helicopter), shallow subtidal (generally an extension of an intertidal meadow into shallow waters <5m deep), or subtidal (no intertidal sites adjoining the meadow).\n* Seagrass community types were determined according to species composition within a meadow. Species composition was based on the percent each species¿ biomass contributed to mean meadow biomass. A standard nomenclature system was used to categorize each meadow (see Table 1 \"Nomenclature for seagrass community types\" in final report). This nomenclature also included a measure of meadow density categories (light, moderate, dense) determined by mean biomass of the dominant species within the meadow (see Table 2 \"Density categories and mean above-ground biomass ranges for each species used in determining seagrass community density\" in final report).\n* Mapping precision estimates (in metres) were based on the mapping method used for that meadow (Table 3 \"Mapping precision and methods for seagrass meadows\" in final report). Mapping precision estimates ranged from 1-10m for intertidal seagrass meadows to >100m for patchy subtidal meadows. Subtidal meadow mapping precision estimates were based on the distance between sites with and without seagrass. The mapping precision estimate was used to calculate an error buffer around each meadow; the area of this buffer is expressed as a meadow reliability estimate (R) in hectares. \n\nFurther information can be found in this publication:\nCarter, A.

The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "Regional land supply assessments measure the stocks of land for future residential, industrial and commercial uses. It provides context for the land use planning and infrastructure provision required to meet demand across selected regional centres in Western Australia. Regional land supply assessments are prepared by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage (the Department) on behalf of the Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC) to fulfil the requirements for tracking and monitoring land supply, as outlined in section 14 of the Planning and Development Act 2005. The role of WAPC include monitoring and forecasting land supply throughout Western Australia, developing strategies for the timely supply of affordable residential land, and researching and developing planning methods and models relating to land use planning, land development and associated matters. \n\nRegional land supply assessments are one of a suite of products produced as part of the Urban Development Program (UDP). The UDP monitors land supply and promotes the timely delivery of residential, industrial and commercial land in Western Australia. The information presented in regional land supply assessments assist State Government agencies, utility and essential service providers, local governments and the private sector in decision making and forward planning. \n\nRegional land supply assessments include key information on:\n•   demand drivers specific to each regional centre, including the major economic factors that influence employment and population growth, and therefore, the demand for land and housing\n•   zoned land supply for residential (including rural living), industrial and commercial uses\n•   development constraints\n•   recent and future land development activity\n•   existing and required physical infrastructure. \n\nThis spatial dataset shows sites/areas that have been identified for future residential, industrial or commercial development. Sites are included where intent has been demonstrated by Government or the development industry to develop the site at some point in the future. Sites are included based on the current, applicable planning framework at the time of capture/analysis. ",

The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were visually undertaken by volunteers. The data covers 47 Local Government Areas (LGAs) across ACT, NSW, SA, TAS, VIC and WA.\n'Super Tuesday' is Australia's largest visual bike count, where volunteer counters observe and record cyclist numbers across Australia. The Bicycle Network data is collected within 97 councils and over 1,500 sites, the 'Super Counts' are Australia's largest cycling surveys of their kind.\nBicycle Network have used a consistent methodology across Australia to collect consistent figures on cycling participation. The data can be used to compliment other traffic surveys, such as automated systems by providing a broader picture of cycling trends at both a local and national scale.\nFor more information please visit Bicycle Network Bike Counts.\nBicycle counts help track progress, and identify areas of improvement to inform active transport policy with the goal of making it easier for more people to choose active modes everyday. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nAURIN has spatially enabled this dataset by creating geometries from the latitude and longitude columns with PostGIS.",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe third of these six experiments was designed to monitor the exchange of water between the bay and the shelf. The data collection spanned one year from April 1989 to April 1990, in order to get an indication of seasonal variability in the flow. Throughout the 12 month period, 3 current meter moorings, a separate tide gauge mooring and a meteorological station were maintained. \n\nTypical mooring deployments were 2 months with inter-deployment gaps of 1 or 2 days. Moorings were re-deployed in nominally the same location, although these varied slightly. Two moorings were maintained in the bay entrance, one off Point Perpendicular and one off Bowen Island, each containing two current meters. A third mooring was in 100m water depth, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular and this mooring housed 3 current meters and a tide gauge. A separate tide gauge was maintained in a mooring in 10m of water, 200m off Bowen Island, inside the bay. [Given that meteorological data collected from the station on Governor Head bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There are four subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n089f8080-c897-11dc-85f3-00188b4c0af8\na2c0a820-c576-11dc-b888-00188b4c0af8\nd03f0f00-c47a-11dc-9a66-00188b4c0af8\ne4eaf410-d469-11dc-9644-00188b4c0af8",

Display, x and y are used in the example above, but any other field can be returned by altering the select component of the sql statement. See examples below.\r\n\r\n# Filters\r\nSearch data sources and LGA can also be used to filter results. When not using a filter, the API defaults to using all records. See examples below.\r\n\r\n## Source Dataset\r\nA filter can be applied to select for a particular source dataset using the 'src' field. The currently available datasets are as follows:\r\n\r\n - **1** for Roads\r\n - **2** for Address\r\n - **3** for Localities\r\n - **4** for Parcels (CREF and SPI)\r\n - **5** for Localities (Propnum)\r\n\r\n## Local Government Area\r\nFilters can be applied to select for a specific local government area using the 'lga_code' field. LGA codes are derrived from Vicmap LGA datasets. Wimmeras LGAs include:\r\n\r\n - **332** Horsham Rural City Council\r\n - **330** Hindmarsh Shire Council\r\n - **357** Northern Grampians Shire Council\r\n - **371** West Wimmera Shire Council\r\n - **378** Yarriambiack Shire Council\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n**Search for the top 10 addresses and roads with the word 'darlot' in their names:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT distinct display, x, y FROM \"4bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a\" WHERE _full_text @@ to_tsquery(replace('darlot', ' ', ' & ')) LIMIT 10)\r\n```\r\n[example](https://data.gov.au/api/3/action/datastore_search_sql?sql=SELECT%20distinct%20display,%20x,%20y%20FROM%20%224bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a%22%20WHERE%20_full_text%20@@%20to_tsquery\\(replace\\(%27darlot%27,%20%27%20%27,%20%27%20%26%20%27\\)\\)%20LIMIT%2010)\r\n\r\n**Search for all roads with the word 'perkins' in their names:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT distinct display, x, y FROM \"4bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a\" WHERE _full_text @@ to_tsquery(replace('perkins', ' ', ' %26 ')) AND src=1\r\n```\r\n[example](https://data.gov.au/api/3/action/datastore_search_sql?sql=SELECT%20distinct%20display,%20x,%20y%20FROM%20%224bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a%22%20WHERE%20_full_text%20@@%20to_tsquery\\(replacE\\(%27perkins%27,%20%27%20%27,%20%27%20%26%20%27\\)\\)%20AND%20src=1)\r\n\r\n**Search for all addresses with the word 'kalimna' in their names, within Horsham Rural City Council:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT distinct display, x, y FROM \"4bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a\" WHERE _full_text @@ to_tsquery(replace('kalimna', ' ', ' %26 ')) AND src=2 and lga_code=332\r\n```\r\n[example](https://data.gov.au/api/3/action/datastore_search_sql?sql=SELECT%20distinct%20display,%20x,%20y%20FROM%20%224bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a%22%20WHERE%20_full_text%20@@%20to_tsquery\\(replace\\(%27kalimna%27,%20%27%20%27,%20%27%20%26%20%27\\)\\)%20AND%20src=2%20and%20lga_code=332)\r\n\r\n**Search for the top 10 addresses and roads with the word 'green' in their names, returning just their display name, locality, x and y:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT distinct display, locality, x, y FROM \"4bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a\" WHERE _full_text @@ to_tsquery(replace('green', ' ', ' %26 ')) LIMIT 10\r\n```\r\n[example](https://data.gov.au/api/3/action/datastore_search_sql?sql=SELECT%20distinct%20display,%20locality,%20x,%20y%20FROM%20%224bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a%22%20WHERE%20_full_text%20@@%20to_tsquery\\(replace\\(%27green%27,%20%27%20%27,%20%27%20%26%20%27\\)\\)%20LIMIT%2010)\r\n\r\n**Search all addresses in Hindmarsh Shire:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT distinct display, locality, x, y FROM \"4bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a\" WHERE lga_code=330\r\n```\r\n[example](https://data.gov.au/api/3/action/datastore_search_sql?sql=SELECT%20distinct%20display,%20locality,%20x,%20y%20FROM%20%224bf30358-6dc6-412c-91ee-a6f15aaee62a%22%20WHERE%20lga_code=330)",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Bonito model in the Marine Fisheries node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.\nMaps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the five global climate models (GCMs) used for the Marine Fisheries node, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "The Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914 provides the Governor of Western Australia the power to proclaim or prescribe through regulation a Surface Water Area. A Surface Water Area is proclaimed for the purposes of regulating the taking of water from watercourses and wetlands. An area is proclaimed, or prescribed through regulations, where there is a need for systematic management of the use of water. The proclamation is made on the recommendation of the Department and must first be tabled before both Houses of Parliament.\n\nProclaiming or prescribing an area has the effect of allowing the use of water for commercial activity under a licence. Where an area has been proclaimed, the provisions of Division 1B of Part III of the Act apply to surface water in that area. This allows comprehensive management of water uses in that area.\n\nThis dataset defines the boundaries which are proclaimed as Irrigation Districts (IDs) under the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act, 1914 (RIWI Act). In addition to the boundary definition within the Act these areas are subject to Division 1B of the Act which implements \nlicensing of water use from watercourses and wetlands in the area.\n\nIrrigation districts are areas where the Water Corporation or another service provider may construct work and supply water to land owners for irrigation purposes.\n\nThis dataset is the result of combining three existing datasets; RIWI Areas, RIWI Irrigation Districts and RIWI Surface Water Areas. It replaces all three.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as RIWI Act, Surface Water Areas and Irrigation Districts (DOW-019)",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nBrackish basil aquifer data indicates the approximate boundary of the basal aquifer with brackish or saline water, on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behaviour on the island.\nThe boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the brackish or saline basal aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but\nthis could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection.   In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift. \nDisclaimer",

    "description": "A reconnaissance survey of the eastern half of the Canberra 4-mile sheet was made during the period January - February 1952. The area mapped may be arbitrarily divided into two sections: the western section includes the eastern halves of the Canberra, Michelago, and Bredbo 1-mile sheets, and the eastern section comprises four 1-mile sheets - Lake Bathurst, Braidwood, Araluen and Bendethera. Belts of strongly folded Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian strata, with associated elongate masses of granite rocks, were encountered; they trend gradually northwards. Graptolites collected from Ordovician strata provide means to date these rocks accurately, and further study of the corals collected from Silurian limestones will similarly permit precise dating. Three fossil localities were found in the Devonian strata, but the brachiopods collected, although well-preserved and representative of many genera, do not permit precise stratigraphical placing without more intensive examination. Outcrops are generally very good in all parts except the Lake Bathurst area, where an extensive cover of Tertiary and later deposits obscures the Palaeozoic rocks.",

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "This study is aimed at identifying the key primary producers, which support abundant fish species with different feeding modes, in a permanently-open (Swan-Canning) and a seasonally-closed (Wilson Inlet) estuary in south-western Australia. \nThe species studied were the sparid Acanthopagrus butcheri (omnivore), the atherinid Leptatherina wallacei (pelagic feeder) and the gobiid Pseudogobius olorum (benthivore). \nThree complementary, quantitative approaches were used:\n1) Stomach content analyses to determine the dietary compositions of the above three species and how they vary with body-size and season;\n2) Stable isotope ratios of C13/C12 and N15/N14 for fish and their prey; and\n3) Fatty acid biomarkers in fish and dietary items. \nStomach content data demonstrated that size-related changes in diet were evident and that dietary compositions of each species differed among estuaries. Stable isotope ratios of N15/N14 showed that the food web in each estuary contained three trophic levels, while the C13/C12 ratio enabled differentiation of the food chains based on detrital material and plankton. Fatty acid data revealed trophic markers for dinoflagellates in A. butcheri and L. wallacei and for diatoms in P. olorum. \nThese findings suggest that:\n1) the food resources are partitioned within and among species, \n2) the dietary compositions differ between estuaries and \n3) different sources of organic material support pelagic and benthic food chains",

    "title": "Probabilistic tsunami inundation assessment from a near-field earthquake source",
    "description": "Tsunamis are a destructive and dangerous hazard for coastal communities. To prepare for future events, Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA) can be used to estimate the frequency and severity of tsunamis. Large-scale PTHAs have been developed by modelling a suite of tsunami events to robustly represent all possible earthquake-generated tsunamis (Behrens et al., 2021). The 2018 Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA18) is a global PTHA that serves as a database of offshore tsunami frequency and wave data (Davies &amp; Griffin, 2018). In this presentation, we will demonstrate the efficient conversion of offshore PTHA18 data to onshore probabilistic inundation data (Figure 1) through the modelling of a stratified random sample of tsunami events. The town of Vanimo in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is used as a case study.  \n\nWe consider the tsunami threat to the north coast of PNG from earthquakes generated in the New Guinea subduction zone. PNG does not currently have a comprehensive tsunami warning system. However, in the case of the New Guinea trench, ground shaking from a large earthquake may provide communities with some warning and, should this occur, PNG government advice is to evacuate to locations 800 m from the coastline (Kawata et al., 1999). Results suggest that this directive is a safe one and inundation further than 800 m inland is estimated to occur with a very low frequency. Evacuation to this distance from the coast may, however, not be achievable within the short period of time between a large earthquake on this trench and the resulting tsunami. Tsunami arrival times are estimated to be &lt;10 min at an average frequency of roughly once in 300 years (Annual Exceedance Probability of 0.333). For Vanimo specifically, this guidance may be best followed in combination with evacuation to at least 5 m elevation. This allows for evacuation to the high elevation Vanimo peninsula (Figure 1) which is close to population centres on the isthmus, and is estimated to be inundated less frequently than other sites within 800 m of the coastline.   \n\nThe offshore PTHA maximum water levels above Mean Sea Level (MSL) show a positive linear correlation with onshore maximum water levels. Linear regression data for every 10x10m cell in the model domain shows how the elevation features influence tsunami wave amplification. The linear regression coefficient at the coastline (0 m elevation) is between 1 and 1.6 with R2 varying between 0.8 and 0.95. Shoaling is apparent in the nearshore and amplification is greater on the exposed, seaward side of the Vanimo peninsula than in more sheltered locations. Such variation makes a good case for applying comprehensive probabilistic inundation as opposed to simpler methods. Conclusions may be applicable to other locations with a near-field source. \n\nPresented at the 24th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM2021)",

    "description": "This layer is the result of a wilderness mapping project that was undertaken by the Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS) in 2005. The scope of the project was the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA) and some adjoining areas considered to be of high conservation area.\n\nThe project driver was to fulfill a requirement of the 1999 TWWHA Management Plan (p94);\n\n\"Develop an enhanced methodology for the quantification of wilderness which more accurately reflects the Tasmanian situation eg. incorporates the effect of the three dimensional nature of the terrain on viewfields and deals systematically with the effects of walkers' huts and walking tracks\".\n\nThe methodology followed the guidelines of the National Wilderness Inventory (NWI) which was developed by the Australian Heritage Commission in the late 1980s and early 1990s to identify wilderness quality across Australia. The methodology is described in detail in the NWI Handbook of Procedures, Content and Usage (Lesslie and Taylor 1995). See hyperlink below for notes on the NWI from the Australian Heritage Commission website.\n\nThe plan notes (p92) that this is likely to involve the implementation of a modified version of the NWI methodology. However, it does not restrict the PWS to the use of this methodology.\n\nThe objective of the first phase of the project (Module 1) was to use the existing NWI methodology to assess wilderness values in the WHA and in specified adjacent areas, based on the latest available information on roads, walkers, huts and similar infrastructure.\n\nIn the second phase (Module 2), wilderness was to be assessed using revised criteria taking into account walkers' huts, tracks and time-remoteness. The assessment of viewfields has been postponed to a future study.\n\nThe business processes, input data, spatial analysis and results are described in the project methodology document, available in the hyperlink below.\n\nThe wilderness quality layer is a coverage that represents the level of naturalness and remoteness based on the proximity of physical intrusions and infrastructure. The study did not consider social aspects.\n\nView dataset:\nhttps://maps.thelist.tas.gov.au/listmap/app/list/map?bmlayer=3&amp;layers=2406\n\nProject methodology:\nhttps://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/public/TWWHA%20Wilderness%20Value%20Assessment%202005.pdf\n\nProject report:\nhttps://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/public/TWWHA_Wilderness_Mapping_Report_2005.pdf\n\nCommonwealth NWI methodology:\nhttp://www.environment.gov.au/node/20141",

    "description": "This dataset contains information from the first health subdomain 'Vulnerable - Physical readiness for school day', of the Australian Early Development Censuses (AEDC) from 2009 - 2018. The data is based on 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp. Other Territories (LGA code 99399) were split across two records in the original data, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (N) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=2\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 2 in this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (%) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=90\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 90 in this dataset.\n\n\nNapranum (S) (LGA code 35670) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (N) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=1\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 1 in this dataset.\n\n\nNapranum (S) (LGA code 35670) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (%) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=90\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 90 in this dataset.\n\n\nAnangu Pitjantjatjara (AC) (LGA code 40250) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (N) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=1\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 1 in this dataset.\n\n\nAnangu Pitjantjatjara (AC) (LGA code 40250) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (%) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=90\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 90 in this dataset.\n\n",

Analyses suggested that it may be possible to mine a section of coal 8 feet 7 inches thick excluding non-coal bands, and that this coal would have an ash content of about 29% and calorific value of 10,000 B.Th.U. per lb. after the exclusion of bands.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "title": "Alice Springs Mulga Flux Data Release 2024_v1",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nAlice Springs Mulga flux station is located on Pine Hill cattle station, near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The woodland is characterized by the <i>Acacia aneura</i> canopy, which is 6.5&nbsp;m tall on average. Elevation of the site is 606&nbsp;m above sea level, and the terrain is flat. Mean annual precipitation at the nearby (45&nbsp;km distant) Bureau of Meteorology station is 305.9&nbsp;mm but ranges between 100&nbsp;mm in 2009 to 750&nbsp;mm in 2010. Predominant wind directions are from the southeast and east. The extent of the woodland is 11&nbsp;km to the east of the flux station and 16&nbsp;km to the south. The soil is red sandy clay (50:50 sand:clay) overlying a 49&nbsp;m deep water table. Pine Hill Station is a functioning cattle station that has been in operation for longer than 50 years. The instrument mast is 13.7&nbsp;m tall. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon are measured using the open-path eddy covariance technique at 11.6&nbsp;m. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature and humidity (11.6&nbsp;m), windspeed and wind direction (9.25&nbsp;m), downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation (12.2&nbsp;m). Precipitation is monitored in a canopy gap (2.5&nbsp;m). Supplementary measurements within and below the canopy include barometric pressure (1&nbsp;m), wind speed (2&nbsp;m, 4.25&nbsp;m and 6.5&nbsp;m), and temperature and humidity (2&nbsp;m, 4.25&nbsp;m and 6&nbsp;m). Below ground soil measurements are made in bare soil, mulga, and understory habitats and include ground heat flux (0.08&nbsp;m), soil temperature (0.02&nbsp;m – 0.06&nbsp;m) and soil moisture (0 – 0.1&nbsp;m, 0.1 – 0.3&nbsp;m, 0.6 – 0.8&nbsp;m and 1.0 – 1.2&nbsp;m). Ancillary measurements include soil water and carbon fluxes, leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, stem basal area, stem growth, litter production, leaf area index, stem hydraulic conductance, and carbon and water stable isotope ratios.

    "description": "This is a collated plant survey data from the Fleurieu Peninsula wetlands (version.2). There is a biological and a spatial component to the dataset. [1] Biological data: This was collated from several sources, collected over the period 2000-2009 and used in the analyses for the paper <i>Diversity patterns of seasonal wetland plant communities mainly driven by rare terrestrial species</i> (Deane et al - Biodiversity and Conservation, DOI:  <em>10.1007/s10531-016-1139-1</em>). Biological data were pre-processed to remove sampling bias (the method is described in the paper). Data are presence-absence of 215 native plant species (i.e., exotic species removed) from 76 seasonal wetlands (size range 0.5 - 35 ha) located on the Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia (centred on latitude 35.5 °S). [2] Spatial data: For each of the 76 wetlands a small amount of spatial data is also provided. Area, centroids, elevation and catchment. \nThe data could be of interest for any typical community data analysis (e.g. beta diversity, similarity, assembly), provided only native wetland plant species were of interest. Data were used to model extinction risk, species-area relationships, occupancy distributions and so on.",

The NSW Education Act states that instruction provided in government schools is to be free of charge, except for overseas students. Students must have access to the minimum curriculum and not be denied the opportunity to meet syllabus requirements because of non-payment of voluntary school contributions.\n\n\nSchools may request contributions for elective subjects for resources that go beyond the minimum requirements of the curriculum following consultation with the school community. Parents and carers who are unable to pay elective subject contributions because of financial hardship may be eligible for assistance from the school.\n\n\nPrincipals can decide on voluntary school contributions and elective subject contributions following consultation with the school community, through structures such as the Parents and Citizens Association (P&amp;C) or the finance/resourcing committee.\n\n\nPrincipals must ensure that students and families who are unable to make a voluntary school contribution or elective subject contribution do not experience any embarrassment or discrimination.

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "title": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA), Version 7 (Regions)",
    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.",

    "description": "Eleven scout drill holes entailing 1290 feet of drilling were sunk to find suitable open-cut prospecting areas for the Young Wallsend Seam of the \"Upper\" Coal Measures within an area of one square mile in Portion 10, Parish of Hexham, Newcastle Region, N.S.W. Several drill holes intersected the Dudley (?) and Yard Seams overlying the Young Wallsend Seam. The scout drilling defined the following inferred reserves of coal: [see record for table data]. These figures do not take into account weathering and possible worked-out areas which may reduce the reserves by as much as 30%. The seams are banded and the quality of the coal could probably be improved considerably by washing. The scout drilling did not define accurately the overburden ratios; however, it is likely that overburden to coal ratio for the Dudley (?) Seam will average very roughly 5:1 and for Young Wallsend about 9:1 if the Dudley is mined beforehand where it overlies the Young Wallsend. These results did not justify commencing a \"testing and defining\" drilling programme. The Yard Seam was not investigated in detail; its thinness precludes it from having any importance for open-cut mining.",

    "description": "\nThis dataset shows land parcels owned by Melbourne Water that have potential to be utilised for liveability related projects. The data does not provide a guarantee that the land can be used, or used by any particular activity. Authority to use the land will still need to be assessed and granted by Melbourne Water. Due to the restrictive nature of potentially using land containing assets such as pipes, pits, retarding basins etc the land has been classified into three landuse types. These types describe the potential for using the land area for different purposes. Land classified as &quot;A&quot; (or &quot;Likely Available&quot;) are those area that are likely to be available for community projects and could be used for a variety of purposes depending on the space. Land classified as &quot;L&quot; (or &quot;Restrictions Apply&quot;) are areas likely to be available for small scale or portable infrastructure such as park benches, goal posts, landscaping and temporary food vans. They are unlikely to be available for large scale infrastructure due to access, drainage, safety, current lease or licence agreements or other requirements. Land classified as &quot;X&quot; (or &quot;Access Only&quot;) are areas likely to be available for access related activities such as walking, running or yoga. 24 hour access is usually required and infrastructure is unlikely to be permitted. To apply, visit: <a href=\"https://melbournewater.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=e60e956c9f304027802e9bef6177fac1\">Our Space Your Place</a>\n\nApproximately 100 Melbourne Water asset datasets were used in the creation of this dataset. Rules governing the use of land on and around each asset class were established and applied to these areas. Coverage is across approximately 80% of MW owned land areas. The next edition aims to increase this to all applicable MW owned land.\n\nFor more details: <a href=\"https://www.melbournewater.com.au/community-and-education/use-our-land/land-community-projects\">Land and Community Projects (link to MW website)</a>\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

The metadata was not provided by the data supplier and has been compiled by the programme based on known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset was supplied as an outcome of the Hunter Asset Workshop by NSW Office of Water.  \n\n\n\nStatus and FType fields were updated based on the GDS (groundwater database) data extraction. \n\nSuggestions of what Asset type should be were added under 'Comments'.\n\n\n\nThere are 694 bores with Unknown Ftype (listed in 'Unknown' sheet). \n\nAnother data extraction using Brio Query to get the Work Comments info managed to get the work purpose for 600+ bores. \n\n67 remaining bores or 1% of the bore data with Unknown purpose and status remained.  Data provider suggests remaining 67 bores should be 'NULL' asset.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis dataset was created to populate missing values for FTYPE in the initial creation of the GW Economic Elements for Hunter (GUID).  The NSW Office of water was supplied with records where FTYPE was unknown and they subsequently queried their database for these records.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nStatus and FType fields were updated based on the GDS (groundwater database) data extraction. \n\nSuggestions of what Asset type should be were added under 'Comments' \n\n\n\nThere are 694 bores with Unknown Ftype (listed in 'Unknown' sheet). \n\nAnother data extraction using Brio Query to get the Work Comments info managed to get the work purpose for 600+ bores. \n\n67 remaining bores or 1% of the bore data with Unknown purpose and status remained.  Data provider suggests remaining 67 bores should be 'NULL' asset.\n\n\n\nNote: Source file includes Surface Water records (ones without 'GW' at beginning of BOREID Field need to be excluded if only performing GW analysis)\n\n\n\nOnly first 2 worksheets are Outputs (Praveen & Unknowns).

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

Does not include zoning from the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWWHA).\n\nA core function of a management plan is to establish zoning, in order to guide use and development.\n\nThe integrity of the zone descriptors from the management plan are retained, with legend classes matching current zoning descriptors from the PWS Reserve Management Zoning Policy.\n\nThree types of zoning exist in this layer. Statutory zoning as defined in the management plan, draft zoning for a management plan in development and prescriptive zoning where additions to a reserve post-date the management plan. \n\nAttached are the business rules that have been adopted for the depiction of the zoning.\n\nStatutory zoning closely matches the zone descriptors in the management plan.\n\nPrescriptive and draft zoning adheres to the business rules adopted for the creation of the General Plan Reserves Zones with input from professional staff.\n\nLinks to the business rules and policy documents can be found below.

The upper\nreaches of the catchment are in the suburbs of Rockdale and Bexley and are principally\nresidential. It flows through a pipe network towards the Illawarra Railway Line. The railway\nline is raised above the natural ground level for a considerable distance either side of the main\npipe network under the line which may restrict surface flows from the western side.\nImmediately east of the railway line the catchment comprises a Commercial area along\nPrinces Highway and incorporates most-of the Rockdale City Centre.\nThe pipe conduit network combines into an open concrete trapezoidal section at Short Street,\nBanksia. The section downstream is through a low level residential area built fairly close to\nthe channel. As the channel continues past West Botany Street it flows through an open park\narea with some adjacent wetland areas. It eventually drains into the Cooks river at the\nconfluence of the Cooks River with Muddy Creek.\nMuddy Creek\nThe catchment area of Muddy Creek is about 5.6km2, its catchment area is heavily urbanised\nwith a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial development, and it drains into the\nCooks River near its entrance to Botany Bay. The residential development is mainly low\ndensity with some patches of medium to high density residential area consistent with urban\nconsolidation.\nMuddy Creek consists of a formed concrete channel from the Cooks River upstream to Frys\nReserve. There are a number of side channels, both open and piped, that laterally feed the\ntrunk flows into the creek. Upstream of Frys Reserve the trunk drainage system divides into a\nnumber of drainage systems combining open concrete channels with piped sections.\nThe section of Muddy Creek downstream of the Bestic Street bridge has been widened and\ndredged to form part of the lower Cooks River estuary. The tailwater level for Muddy Creek\nis controlled by the water level in the Cooks River.\nScarborough Ponds has a catchment area of about 4 km2 and a stream length of about 3.4 km.\nThere are three main ponds or wetlands, from England Street to President Avenue, from\nPresident Avenue to Barton Street, and downstream of Barton Street. The day-to-day water\nlevels of each pond are controlled at the downstream end by weirs at President Avenue,\nBarton Street and the outlet structure at Florence Street. The Florence Street outlet structure\nconnects the ponds to Botany Bay, allowing the tide to penetrate into the downstream ponds.\nThe Florence Street culvert consists of triple 1350 mm diameter pipes.\nDevelopment within the catchment is predominantly low to medium density residential\ndevelopment with localised commercial and industrial development. The areas adjacent to\nthe ponds have been landscaped into open spaces suitable for passive recreational activities.\nSome residential development on the eastern side of the ponds comes very close to the ponds.\nScarborough Ponds\nThe existing culvert under the railway line at Frys Reserve produces a throttling of the flows\nand causes Frys Reserve to act as an on-line retarding basin. The adjacent Warialda Street is\nexpected to be inundated in about a 20% AEP flood. Sydney Water has recently constructed\na new bypass culvert under the railway line to alleviate the hazard of floodwater through the\nHegarty Street underpass. The flood study examined flood behaviour for the original and\nnow existing culvert conditions under the railway line at Frys Reserve.\nThere are a large number of road and pedestrian bridges over Muddy Creek that may impact\non the flood behaviour. The major bridge crossings are at the Princes Highway, Bay Street and Bestic Street. In addition a sewer line crosses over Muddy Creek upstream of the Princes\nHighway. This sewer line would act as a major impediment to flood flows, ponding water\nagainst the concrete structure with no bypass arrangement. Some of the properties adjacent to\nthe creek have boundary fences located close to the Muddy Creek channel and these would\nimpact on flood flows by restricting the spread of water onto the floodplains.\nThe section of Muddy Creek downstream of the Bestic Street bridge has been widened and\ndredged to form part of the lower Cooks River estuary. The tailwater level for Muddy Creek\nis controlled by the water level in the Cooks River.\nScarborough Ponds\nScarborough Ponds has a catchment area of about 4 km2 and a stream length of about 3.4 km.\nThere are three main ponds or wetlands, from England Street to President Avenue, from\nPresident Avenue to Barton Street, and downstream of Barton Street. The day-to-day water\nlevels of each pond are controlled at the downstream end by weirs at President Avenue,\nBarton Street and the outlet structure at Florence Street. The Florence Street outlet structure\nconnects the ponds to Botany Bay, allowing the tide to penetrate into the downstream ponds.\nThe Florence Street culvert consists of triple 1350 mm diameter pipes.\nDevelopment within the catchment is predominantly low to medium density residential\ndevelopment with localised commercial and industrial development.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset contains the chemical and strontium isotope data of a selection of cores and cuttings from the Beetaloo Sub-basin, which were assessed from the core library of the Northern Territory Geological Survey. A total of 5 bores (Amungee NW-1, Beetaloo W1, BH 1, 12BC001, 12LE001) were sampled for either cuttings or parts of the core. The data showed that the aquifer variability for strontium isotopes is much higher than the groundwater variability (as expected) but also that waters in the CLA have a strontium isotope range that differs from the one of the aquifer rock. Furthermore the analyses allowed estimating the in-situ production of helium from radioactive decay of U and Th in the host rock and demonstrated that the high helium concentrations found in groundwater could not be produced within the aquifer itself but are due to fluid admixture from other (likely deeper) formations.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThese were analysed at the CSIRO Analytical Support Unit at Waite Campus for their elemental content by cation and Sr isotope analysis after digestion with Aqua Regia – for carbonate samples – or HF digestion – for samples with higher silicate contents such as basalts and sandstones below the CLA.

    "description": "This dataset comprises the results of phytoplankton pigment composition analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network - National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. Pigment samples are taken for the complete water column (0-50m) and at the depths of the shallow WQM and the deeper WQM attached to the mooring at that site.\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

    "description": "We propose to monitor the bursts from the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst FRB 20240619D over six months using the Murriyang UWL receiver. The primary aim is to study the evolution of burst activity and polarization properties with frequency and time, and to discover any potential periodicity in the burst activity. These insights will enhance our understanding of the progenitor, emission physics, and the immediate magneto-ionic environment of FRB 20240619D, thereby informing the general FRB population. A total of 15 hours of observing between August and November 2024 resulted in over 1300 bursts detected using the UWL receiver. Some bursts exhibit complex spectro-temporal emission patterns. The burst rate, based on Murriyang and MeerKAT observations, indicates that the source was active until September 2nd, after which it became inactive. Given that two other repeating FRBs have exhibited periodic activity cycles, it is reasonable to expect that FRB 20240619D could become active again, making continued monitoring crucial. The UWL receiver's broad frequency coverage and sensitivity are essential for detecting many bursts and enabling simultaneous observations at different frequencies. This is important for understanding the burst activity evolution with time and frequency, spectral properties, and underlying emission mechanisms. The combination of sensitivity and wide bandwidth makes Murriyang the ideal telescope for monitoring this FRB. Results from these observations will be pivotal in understanding FRB 20240619D's place within the broader repeater population and its potential connection to broader FRB progenitor models.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "To return the Murray–Darling river system to health, the Murray–Darling Basin Plan requires recovery of surface water and groundwater for the environment. The government has prioritised infrastructure investment as its preferred method of water recovery. Read more about water programs in the Murray-Darling Basin here: <http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs>http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\nThis data set provides farm-level data on projects funded to recover water under the Basin Plan. Programs included are:\r\n\r\n* Commonwealth On-Farm Further Irrigation Efficiency Program (contributes to Efficiency Measures)\r\n\r\n* QLD Healthy Headwaters Water Use Efficiency Project\r\n\r\n* NSW Irrigated Farm Modernisation\r\n\r\n* NSW Basin Pipe\r\n\r\n* Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project Two\r\n\r\n* On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Operators Program in NSW\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Program for South Australia\r\n\r\n* South Australia River Murray Sustainability Program\r\n\r\n* Victorian Farm Modernisation Program\r\n\r\nFarm-level data is not available for the following programs:\r\n\r\n* Goulburn Murray Water Connections \r\n\r\n* NSW Metering Pilot\r\n\r\n* NSW Southern Valleys Metering Project\r\n\r\n* Sunraysia Modernisation Program\r\n\r\n##Exclusions\r\nPrograms that purchase water entitlements directly without associated infrastructure works are not included. Additionally, projects where a water entitlement has __not__ been returned to the Commonwealth, for example environmental projects, are also excluded.\r\n\r\n#Data field descriptions\r\n* Program: Text - Name of program under which the on-farm works were funded.\r\n\r\n* Round: Numerical or text - Funding round under which on-farm works were funded. Text fields generally refer to \"Not applicable\" where the program did not have funding rounds, or \"Pilot\" where funding was provided under a pilot arrangement.\r\n\r\n* Delivery partner: Text - The organisation contracted to deliver the program on behalf of the Australian Government. These organisations are responsible for day-to-day management of on-farm projects, and have the contract with the farmer.\r\n\r\n* Project identifier: Numerical or text - An identifier for each project unique to that program. \r\n\r\n* Australian Government project funding (GST exclusive): Currency - Australian dollars - Australian Government Project Funding excludes both GST payments and administration components of funding. Project values may change over time as the project is finalised and subject to final audit and acquittal.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML nominal): Numeric - Megalitres - Water transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Total water savings may exceed those returned to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML LTAAY): Numeric - Megalitres in LTAAY terms - LTAAY stands for Long Term Average Annual Yield, which is a method used to standardise the calculation of expected water recoveries in the Murray–Darling Basin from different water access entitlement categories and across catchments in the Basin. This measure of water volume is relevant for measuring progress of water recovery towards meeting the sustainable diversion limits set out in the Basin Plan. The average annual yield for Murray-Darling Basin resource units is calculated using the current long-term diversion limit equivalent factors (v2.05) agreed by the Ministerial Council in November 2011, or in the absence of a factor, is modelled by the MDBA in consultation with the States. Following accreditation of the Water Resource Plans for an area, the planning assumptions used within will determine the LTAAY. \r\n\r\n* Water entitlement class: Text - The type of water that was transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Water entitlements are perpetual or ongoing entitlement to exclusive access to a share of water from a specified consumptive pool as defined in the relevant water plan. The nature and names for water entitlements differ across the Murray-Darling Basin. Further information is available at: <http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml>http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml.\r\n\r\n* State: Text - State from which the water entitlement was sourced.\r\n\r\n* SDL Resource Unit: Text - The geographical location from which the water entitlement was sourced, based on information provided by the delivery partner. Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) Resource Units are defined in legislation and available at <https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160>https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160.\r\n\r\n* Description of project: Text - Description of on-farm works undertaken. This field has been edited to ensure that it has been appropriately de-identified consistent with our obligations under the _Privacy Act 1988_.\r\n\r\n* Project  commencement date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project commenced. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as the date Funding Agreement with the Delivery Partner was signed.\r\n\r\n* Project completion date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project was completed. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as approval date of final activity report, sub-project type closure report or closure letter. Not all projects have been completed at the time of producing this report.\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer: The Australian Government acting through the Department of Agriculture has exercised due care and skill in preparing and compiling this data. In some instances, the department has relied on the delivery agent - which is responsible for the management and implementation of the program (and has the contract with the individual farmer) - to prepare the data. Notwithstanding, the Department of Agriculture, its employees and advisers disclaim all liability, including liability for negligence and for any loss, damage, injury, expense or cost incurred by any person as a result of accessing, using or relying on any of the data to the maximum extent permitted by law._",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

The data spans the months of 2012 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for a 1 year period between November 1988 and October 1989 inclusive. Individual measurements have been converted so that the yearly trend of wind speed and direction can be seen. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis Asset Database v1.0 on 03 August 2015 is original preliminary Asset Database\n\n\n\nThe Asset database is registered to the BA repository as an ESRI personal goedatabase (.mdb - doubling as a MS Access database) that can store, query, and manage non-spatial data while the spatial data is in a separate file geodatabase joined by AID/ElementID. \n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. A report on the WAIT process for the Hunter is included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Hunter subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. \n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_201500803.doc\", located in this filet.\n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.\n\n\n\nDetailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"SSB_asset_database_doc_201500803.doc\" located in this file.\n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1.0\t3/08/2015\tInitial database.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 03 August 2015.

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset is part of the assessment and mapping of foreshore values, condition and pressure in the North and Cradle Coast Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions of Tasmania. The 13 line maps produced in this study are intended to be used as a tool to assist managers and stakeholders in the identification of management issues with regards to foreshore planning, development, and natural resources. Assessment of the foreshore is based on the division of the mean high water mark into 100 m line segments. Using an assessment framework, each foreshore segment is assigned a score for a series of environmental stressors and values. Segments are colour coded based on their score to reflect their values and the differing levels of risk associated with each stressor. This digital line map is a representation of the risk to the intertidal zone in regard to aquatic sediments in the North and Cradle Coast NRM regions and is derived from an assessment of pressure and vulnerability. An explanatory report is available from the data custodian and from the Aquenal website which provides detailed methods and further explanation of the dataset.",

There are three main location types; Residential, Community and Other. These types are further broken down into Subdivisions which show an intermediate level of information, and further into Groups which show a finer level of detail\nData Classification - https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/about-the-data/classifications \nGlossary and Data Dictionary - https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/about-the-data/glossary-and-data-dictionary",

    "description": "The Bonney Coast (BONC) HF ocean radar system covers an area of the Bonney Coast, South Australia, which has a recurring annual upwelling feature near to the coast that significantly changes the ecosystem from one of warm water originating in Western Australia, to one dominated by cold upwelling water from off the continental shelf.  The dynamics of this area and the relationship between ocean circulation, chemistry and sediments control the larval species and the higher marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.  \n\nThe data from this site provide linking observations between the Southern Ocean and NSW through processes that occur on weekly to El Nino time scales.  \n\nThe BONC HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Nora Creina (37.329 S 139.850 E) and Blackfellows Cave (37.940 S 140.457 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km\nand a range resolution of 3 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in March 2017.",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2021 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",
