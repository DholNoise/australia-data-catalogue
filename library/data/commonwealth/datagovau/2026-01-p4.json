The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55.

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for July 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents results of the 2015 Northern Prawn Fishery survey, comprising survey based estimates of financial and economic performance for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial years, as well as non-survey based estimates of economic performance for the fishery in the 2014-15 financial year. Other indicators presented in the report include the total factor productivity index, input costs and ouput prices and management costs. \r\n\r\n The Australian fisheries economic indicators report expands on and takes the place of the former Australian fisheries surveys report. The information and analysis contained in these reports are accessed by policy makers, managers, researchers and industry. Alongside the usual detailed information about the financial performance of the average vessel and the overall economic performance of the fishery, this report also provides analysis of additional economic indicators for the Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery. The construction of these indicators draw upon the data collected through the fisheries survey program. Together with the financial and economic performance information, these indicators help to form a comprehensive picture of the economic performance of the Northern Prawn Fishery over a number of years. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The report has found that profit at full equity, a profit indicator that assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, increased for the average boat in the fishery between 2012-13 and 2013-14, from $239 066 to $382 939. \r\n• Net economic returns (NER) for the fishery rose from $5.2 million in 2012-13 to $12.3 million in 2013-14. The increase in NER from 2012-13 to 2013-14 was primarily driven by faster growth in fishing income than in fishing costs. The growth in fishing income was driven by increased landings of tiger prawns and banana prawns offsetting slightly lower beach prices for each. \r\n• The report indicates that total factor productivity (TFP) improved from 2004-05 to 2013-14. A strong relationship is evident between TFP and landed banana prawn catch, which is in turn largely dependent on seasonal conditions. Improved productivity also reflects the targeting of maximum economic yield (MEY) in the tiger prawn component of the fishery from 2004-05, effort reduction targets by management and the structural adjustment package (completed 2006-07) removing excess capital in the industry. \r\n",

    "description": "<b>Version 29 January 2020</b>\nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the North Lakes Locality and Caboolture West master plan area.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nFor more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/subsite.aspx?id=139941\">helpful information sheets</a> or contact Council. \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Further details on the Qld Planning Provisions can be found <a href=\"http://www.dilgp.qld.gov.au/planning/state-planning-instruments/queensland-planning-provisions.html\">here</a>.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "This data was collected in February - March 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R4.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, February 26, 2013\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, March 04, 2013\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

The type of meadow (continuous or patchy), epiphytic cover on seagrass (as none, very low, low, medium, high or very high), and macroalgae cover (as percentage cover in categories: 0, &lt;15%, 15-45%, 45-75%, &gt;75%) were recorded at each site. At approximately a third of the sites, physical \nwater profiles, secchi depth and photosynthetically active radiation (euphotic depth) were recorded. When observation locations were inaccessible by boat, sites were accessed from kayaks to make observations. \n\nThe datasets making up the seagrass survey data are:\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass - point dataset\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Extent - polygon showing presence/absence\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Cover - polygon showing % cover\n\nLayers:\n\n<code>PrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Jan_2021 \n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass points where Year = '2021'\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Extent_Jan_2021\n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass_Extent where Year = '2021'\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Cover_Jan_2021\n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass_cover points where Year = '2021'\n</code>",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Alice Springs for 2017. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "The NSW Bateman's Marine Park 120m (BMP120) mooring is located at Latitude:36.213 S, Longitude:150.309 E. It was first deployed on 2011-03-29. \n\nIt is one of two moorings deployed near Narooma, southern NSW, to capture the variability of the shelf waters, poleward of the East Australian Current (EAC) separation point. The location, adjacent to Bateman's Marine Park (BMP), was chosen for its proximity to other IMOS activities (AATAMS line and AUV survey sites), the availability of suitable vessels for servicing, and to minimise the risk of mooring loss due to commercial fishing. \n\nInstrumentation, position in the water column and sampling regime are consistent with other NSW IMOS moorings. The mooring consists of AQUAtech 520T and 520PT AQUAloggers at nominal 8m spacing through the water column, sampling at 5 minute time intervals. Nominal heights above seabed of the instruments and quantities measured are: 6PT, 14T, 22T, 30T, 38PT, 46T, 54PT, 62T, 70T, 78T, 86PT, 94T, 102PT.\n\nThe BMP moorings are serviced every 6-8 weeks. This mooring was discontinued and removed in April 2014, it was redeployed again shortly afterwards through co-investment from Bega Valley Shire Council.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

The East Asian-Australasian Flyway extends from the Arctic Circle through Eastern and South East Asia to Australia and New Zealand and encompasses 22 countries. The East Asian-Australasian Shorebird Site Network was launched in 1996. It is now known as the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Site Network. Corner Inlet was listed as a shorebird site at the launch of the East Asian-Australasian Shorebird Site Network in 1996. In 2000, two other Victorian sites joined the network: Western Port, Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula. In 2006, Shallow Inlet Marine and Coastal Park and Discovery Bay Coastal Park were added. Adding these sites to the network provides recognition for Victoria's most important shorebird sites.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Mixed Cropping Zone Grazing System",
    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the mixed cropping zone grazing system model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

This dataset is for terrestrial data only. State, Territory and the large NGO conservation agencies supply data current for 30 June 2016. This is the tenth version of the terrestrial database, with previous versions released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Department also publishes protected areas data for the marine environment. \"CAPAD 2016-marine\" contains spatial and text information about offshore protected areas, for both State and Commonwealth waters. Previous versions of CAPAD marine information have been published in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. \n\nCAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area:\"A protected area is an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means\" (IUCN 1994).\n\nThe department publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad/ This version of CAPAD 2016 is a public and downloadable version of CAPAD 2016 data, available for use through the CC-BY licencing model. \n\nMain attributes in the full version of CAPAD 2016 include:\n\nPA_ID: The protected area ID code. Created from RES_NUMBER if unique, otherwise it is a DoEE generated number.\n\nNAME: the name of the protected area. Gazetted PAs with no name are flagged as \"Unnamed\" with a reserve number. \n\nTYPE: the type of protected area according to the protected area establishment mechanism. \n\nTYPE_ABBR: the abbreviation of the TYPE.\nAA\t Aboriginal Area\nACCP\t Conservation Covenant [Approved Conservation Covenant Program]\nASMA\t Antarctic Specially Managed Areas\nASPA\t Antarctic Specially Protected Areas\nBG\t Botanic Gardens\nBG_COM\t Botanic Gardens (Commonwealth)\nCA\t Conservation Area\nCCA\t Coordinated Conservation Area\nCCAZ1\t CCA Zone 1 National Park\nCCAZ3\t CCA Zone 3 State Conservation Area\nCOR\t Coastal Reserve\nCP\t Conservation Park\nCR\t Conservation Reserve\nFLR\t Flora Reserve\nFR\t Forest Reserve\nGR\t Game Reserve\nHA\t Heritage Agreement\nHIR\t Historical Reserve\nHR\t Heritage River\nHS\t Historic Site\nHTR\t Hunting Reserve\nIPA\t Indigenous Protected Area\nKCR\t Karst Conservation Reserve\nMA\t Management Area\nMAA\t Management Agreement Area\nMR\t Miscellaneous Reserve\nNAP\t Nature Park\nNCA\t Natural Catchment Area\nNCR\t Nature Conservation Reserve\nNFR\t Natural Features Reserve\nNP\t National Park\nNPA\t National Park Aboriginal\nNPC\t National Park (Commonwealth)\nNPS4\t National Parks Act Schedule 4 park or reserve\nNR\t Nature Reserve\nNRA\t Nature Recreation Area\nNREF\t Nature Refuge\nNRS\t NRS Addition - Gazettal in Progress\nNS\t National Park (Scientific)\nOCA\t Other Conservation Area\nOCA_NAP Other Conservation Area or Nature Park\nOP\t Other\nPA\t Protected Area\nPNPA\t Proposed National Parks Act park or park addition\nPNR\t Private Nature Reserve\nPPP\t Permanent Park Preserve\nPS\t Private Sanctuary\nRA\t Reference Area\nRCP\t Recreation Park\nREP\t Regional Park\nRNA\t Remote and Natural Area - not scheduled under National Parks Act\nRNAS6\t Remote and Natural Area - Schedule 6, National Parks Act\nRP\t Recreation Park\nRR\t Regional Reserve\nRSR\t Resources Reserve\nS5G\t 5(1)(g) Reserve\nS5H\t 5(1)(h) Reserve\nSCA\t State Conservation Area\nSP\t State Park\nSR\t State Reserve\nWP\t Wilderness Park\nWPA\t Wilderness Protection Area\nWZ\t Wilderness Zone - Schedule 5, National Parks Act\n\nIUCN: the IUCN protected area management category ascribed by the Managing authority, as outlined in the publication: CNPPA/WCMC \"Guidelines for Protected Area management categories\". Gland: IUCN, 1994. (ISBN: 2-8317-0201-1).\n\nDefinitions include:\nIA\tStrict Nature Reserve: managed mainly for science;\nIB\tWilderness Area: managed mainly for wilderness protection;\nII\tNational Park: managed mainly for ecosystem protection;\nIII\tNatural Monument: managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features;\nIV\tHabitat / Species Management Area: managed mainly for conservation through management intervention;\nV\tProtected Landscape / Seascape: managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation;\nVI\tManaged Resource Protected Area: managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems.\nNA         (Not applicable) - Denotes an area that does not meet the NRS criteria or the IUCN definition of a protected area but has management complimentary to the NRS.\n\nGAZ_AREA: area in hectares as described in the nomination document (e.g. parliamentary gazettal), to the nearest hectare. Some protected areas do not have a specific area in the designation.\n\nGIS_AREA: area in hectares based on current spatial data and an Albers equal area projection for Australia. Where protected area consists of multiple polygons (parts) the GIS_AREA is the sum of all the polygons with the same name, type, state and IUCN category. It is this field that is used to calculate the statistics provided in spreadsheets at: www.environment.gov.au/capad/\n\nREPT_AREA is the same with GIS_AREA (previously REPT_AREA is in hectares from the GAZ_AREA attribute and if this is a null value then the GIS_AREA is used. Due to the fact that not all received data have REPT_AREA, it is incomplete and inconsistent if REPT_AREA is used for analysis. \n\nGAZ_DATE: the first gazettal or proclamation date that established any protected area at this site. A default date of 01/01/1900 is applied for undated and unlabelled polygons supplied to DoEE.\n\nLATEST_GAZ: the date of the most recent gazettal or proclamation to add land to the protected area. It can be the same date as the GAZ_DATE.\n\nNRS_PA: This attribute indicates the status of the protected area as part of the National Reserve System (NRS). \n\"Y\" = Yes. The land has been assessed as a protected area that meets the standard for inclusion in the NRS. \n\"I\" = an interim protected area. The land has been assessed to meet the standard for inclusion in the NRS but has not been formally established as a protected area although binding agreements are in place for formal protection to occur in the future.\n\"N\" = No. The land has been assessed not to meet the standard for inclusion in the NRS but is managed for nature conservation without meeting the NRS standard.\n\"ND\" = Not Determined. The land is probably managed for nature conservation that has not been assessed to determine if it meets the standard for inclusion in the NRS.\n\nSTATE: The state is the state or territory that the protected area is located in. EXT= protected areas located in Australian external territories.\n\nAUTHORITY: The Authority responsible for the management of the protected area mechanism. \nAAD  -  Australian Antarctic Division\nAC_SA  -  Alexandrina Council - South Australia\nACT_TCCS  -  ACT Transport Canberra and City Services\nAS_PL  -  Austland Services P/L\nAWC  -  Australian Wildlife Conservancy\nAWC_BA  -  Australian Wildlife Conservancy and Birdlife Australia\nAWC_DPAW  -  Australian Wildlife Conservancy and Department of Parks and Wildlife WA\nAWC_TLLFW  -  Australian Wildlife Conservancy and Tony and Lisette Lewis Foundation WildlifeLink\nAWC_YC  -  Australian Wildlife Conservancy and Yulmbu Community\nBHA  -  Bush Heritage Australia\nBHA_NTWA  -  Bush Heritage Australia and National Trust of Western Australia\nBRC_TAS  -  Burnie Council - Tasmania\nCCC_QLD  -  Caloundra City Council - Queensland\nCCC_TAS  -  Clarence City Council - Tasmania\nDOEE  -  Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy\nDRC_TAS  -  Dorset Council - Tasmania\nEAC_QLD  -  Ewamian Aboriginal Corporation\nEL_NSW  -  Enduring Landscapes Inc\nFC_NSW  -  Forestry Corporation of NSW\nFUA  -  Federation University Australia (was Uni Ballarat)\nGCC_NSW  -  Gosford City Council – New South Wales\nHCR_CMA  -  Hunter Central Rivers Catchment Management Authority\nILC  -  Indigenous Land Corporation\nIMG  -  Indigenous Management Group\nKNC_TAS  -  Kingborough Council - Tasmania\nKRGC_NSW  -  Ku-ring-gai Council – New South Wales\nLCC_TAS  -  Launceston City Council - Tasmania\nLILC  -  Local Indigenous Land Council\nMINCA_QLD  -  Magnetic Island Nature Care Association\nNF_SA  -  Nature Foundation South Australia Inc\nNMC_TAS  -  Northern Midlands Council - Tasmania\nNSC_QLD  -  Noosa Shire Council - Queensland\nNSW_OEH  -  NSW Office of Environment and Heritage\nNT_PWCNT  -  Parks and Wildlife Commission of the NT\nNTWA  -  National Trust of Western Australia\nQLD_EHP  -  Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection\nQLD_NPSR  -  Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing\nSA_DEWNR  -  South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources\nSA_FRST  -  Forestry South Australia\nSCRC_QLD  -  Sunshine Coast Regional Council - Queensland\nSET  -  South Endeavour Trust\nSHFT  -  Sydney Harbour Federation Trust\nTAS_DPIPWE  -  Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment\nTAS_HYDRO  -  Hydro Tasmania\nTAS_PAHSMA  -  Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority - Tasmania\nTAS_PRIV  -  Private (miscellaneous) - Tasmania\nTAS_WATER  -  TasWater\nTAS_WPMT  -  Wellington Park Management Trust - Tasmania\nTFN_QLD  -  Queensland Trust for Nature\nTFN_VIC  -  Trust for Nature Victoria\nTLC  -  Tasmanian Land Conservancy Inc\nTSRA  -  Torres Strait Regional Authority\nVIC_DELWP  -  Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning\nWA_DPAW  -  Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife\nWAC  -  Winangakirri Aboriginal Corporation\n\nDATASOURCE: Describes the source of the data for the protected area, values are: \nAAD  -  Australian Antarctic Division\nACT_TCCS  -  ACT Transport Canberra and City Services\nAWC  -  Australian Wildlife Conservancy\nBHA  -  Bush Heritage Australia\nBHA_NTWA  -  Bush Heritage Australia and National Trust of Western Australia\nDOEE  -  Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy\nDOEE_NRSP  -  Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy - National Reserve System Program\nFC_NSW  -  Forestry Corporation of NSW\nLHI_Board  -  Lord Howe Island Board\nNF_SA  -  Nature Foundation SA Inc\nNSW_OEH  -  NSW Office of Environment and Heritage\nNT_PWCNT  -  Parks and Wildlife Commission of the NT\nNTWA  -  National Trust of Western Australia\nQLD_EHP  -  Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection\nQLD_NPSR  -  Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing\nSA_DEWNR  -  South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources\nSA_FRST  -  Forestry South Australia\nTAS_DPIPWE  -  Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment\nTFN_QLD  -  Queensland Trust for Nature \nTFN_VIC  -  Trust for Nature Victoria\nTLC  -  Tasmanian Land Conservancy Inc\nTSRA  -  Torres Strait Regional Authority\nVIC_DELWP  -  Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning\nWA_DPAW  -  Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife\n\nGOVERNANCE: Records the type of governance that has management and decision making responsibility. G = Government, C = Community (conserved areas including indigenous peoples or local communities), J = Joint or P = Privately managed.\n\nCOMMENTS: Extra information jurisdictions elect to supply. In the case of Tasmania the following abbreviations have been supplied. PAPL: Protected Areas on Private Land, PFRP: Private Forest Reserves Program, BHP: Biodiversity Hotspots Program, CLAC: Crown Land Assessment Classification Project, FCF: Forest Conservation Fund, FCF_DAT: Forest Conservation Fund -Direct Approach Tas, MBHT: Midlands Biodiversity Hotspots Tender, NFVP: Non-Forest Vegetation Program, R_40s:  Roaring Forties Offset, Rev_Fund: Revolving Fund, TCFA: Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement, TFA: Tasmanian Forest Agreement, FRs: Forest Reserves, MCF: Midlands Conservation Fund (Stewardship Agreements – Tas Land Conservancy (TLC).\n\nENVIRON: A protected area gazetted as terrestrial may have a marine component and vice versa. A protected area can be 'T' terrestrial, marine 'M' and both 'B'. Terrestrial CAPAD 2016 contains 'T' and 'B'. Marine CAPAD 2016 contains 'M' and ‘B’. If a record is coded as ‘B’ by the data provider DOEE calculates the proportional representation of marine and terrestrial areas within the polygon. If less than 70% of the area of the reserve is marine then the whole record is included in this dataset. If 70% or more of the area of the reserve is marine then the whole record is included in Marine CAPAD 2016\n\nOVERLAP: Shows whether or not the protected area is overlapped by another. This field has been included, in terrestrial CAPAD only, to deal with the “stacked” nature of some terrestrial PAs so that overlaps could be ‘flattened’ for the purposes of calculating the protected area coverage of Australia. Terrestrial protected areas with NO overlaps will be allocated a value of “1”. As a general rule, where two PA’s overlap, the PA with the higher ranking (based on 'TYPE' and 'IUCN' category) will be allocated as “1” for the overlap field with the lower ranking PA allocated a value of “2”. For example, where a National Park (IUCN II) overlaps with a Nature Refuge (IUCN VI) the National Park will be allocated the value of “1” and the Nature Refuge will be allocated the value of “2”. For consistency with national scale products like IBRA and IMCRA (and area calculations for PA’s across state borders) DOEE applies a ‘clip’ to the state borders component of the Geoscience Australia COAST 100K dataset – and not the coastline. Each jurisdiction use their own, generally higher resolution, coastline dataset. When doing queries (especially spatial) and area calculations you need to be aware of this attribute. Users may wish to use the following SQL statement: Select * from CAPAD2016 where OVERLAP = '1' AND NRS_PA IN ('Y', 'I')\n\nX_COORD: is the longitude in decimal degrees east within the object closest to the centre of the object using the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994.\n\nY_COORD: is the latitude in decimal degrees south within the object closest to the centre of the object using the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994.\n\nMGT_PLAN: The code of the status of the management plan for the protected area.\nDefinitions include:\nP - In Preparation - Some form of management document was being prepared.\nD - Draft - A draft management document was released for comment by the public, management board or equivalent.\nS - Statutory - Enabling legislation establishes the management of a protected area and separate management document is not required.\nI - Management Intent - A formal statement of management intent has been prepared that clearly sets out the management objectives for the protected area but includes little else.\nM - Management Plan - A formally adopted management plan that has been through consultation and contains strategies and actions for implementation for this protected area. \nR - Regional Plan - A formally adopted management plan has been through consultation and contains general strategies and actions for implementation over a group of protected areas.\nN - Unknown - No form of management document could be found.\nUR - Under Review - The management plan is under review\n\nRES_NUMBER: The reserve number (if declared) as used by the controlling authority. IPA Reserve numbers are allocated by DOEE.\n\nEPBC: This identifies if the reserve can be considered under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). It will be used to identify Commonwealth features for inclusion in the Protected Matters Search Tool. \nCommonwealth = Commonwealth reserve (either a Commonwealth National Park, Commonwealth Botanic Garden or Antarctic protected/managed reserve) – as outlined in Section 342 of the Act.\nPrivate = Privately managed reserve – identified by ‘Governance = P'\nState = State managed reserve – as supplied by State/Territory authority\n\nOBJECTID *, Shape *, SHAPE.AREA and SHAPE.LEN are automatically generated ESRI attributesCC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis dataset is available under the CC-BY data licencing model and users are required to acknowledge the Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy as the source of the data in any of their uses.

This spatial layer is based on the MOG2009, with reduced extent based on disturbances from fire and timber harvesting up to July 2018.    \n\nComing soon - The addition of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for parts of the  Central Highlands and East Gippsland will be added progressively through 2019-20.  The addition of these LiDAR derived classifications to the MOG dataset, will provide Victoria's most complete and up to date assessment of Victoria's modelled old growth forest extent.",

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Division of Economics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, (RSPAS) based at The Australian National University in Canberra. ***** The purpose of this paper is to document and analyse the immediate economic impact of the Indian Ocean tsunami generated by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of 26 December 2004 and the disaster management process in the immediate aftermath of the disaster with a focus on the two worst affected countries - Indonesia (Aceh province) and Sri Lanka. The 26 December Tsunami is unique among large disasters in recorded human history, not only because of the sheer number of casualties and massive displacement of people, but also because of the unprecedented international donor response and the logistic challenges faced by international organizations and aid agencies in organising and coordinating relief efforts. Our preliminary findings point to the importance of educating the public about simple precautions in the event of a disaster and enforcement of coastal environmental regulations as disaster prevention policies. The findings also makes a strong case for designing policies and programs, as an integral part of national development strategy, for mitigating the impact of natural disasters on the poor and highlights the need for combining international aid commitments with innovative approaches to redressing problems of limited aid absorptive capacity in disaster affected countries.",

    "description": "When digital television was introduced to Australia, the mySwitch website was set up to help viewers and installers retune digital televisions as analog services were decommissioned. By entering a street address into mySwitch, viewers can see if television signal coverage is available and, if so, which transmitter is likely to provide the best signal. When the digital TV restack process was completed, mySwitch was retained to assist viewers and installers to retune TVs to the new channel arrangements.\r\n\r\nmySwitch relies on comprehensive, terrain-based coverage modelling generated by the ACMA’s state-of-the-art coverage prediction tools. This data has now been made available to the public, and may be used to support other projects or applications.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while the mySwitch data has been updated from time to time as new TV transmissions are commissioned, the transmitter data and files reflect coverage predictions as at 2014 for the great majority of sites. Therefore, there may be some differences between the mySwitch data and the current situation.

Nearby residents who have subscribed to the <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Disaster-Management/Before-a-Disaster/MoretonAlert\">MoretonAlert system</a> will receive a SMS text and/or email notification the day before a burn proceeds.\n\nAdditional burns to those listed may be undertaken during the year dependent on the weather and site conditions, and notifications will be issued.\n\nFor more information about council planned burns in your area, visit Council's <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Disaster-Management/Planned-Burns\">Planned Burn Information</a> or contact Moreton Bay Council on (07) 3205 0555.",

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a technical report published through the Economics and Environment Network at The Australian National University in Canberra.\n*****\nUsing individual vessel data from the Malaysian gill net, the study finds that most fishers exhibit a high degree of technical efficiency. Moreover, the factors explaining efficiency significantly differ by region and overall level of economic development. For instance, in the poorer and less developed east coast primary schooling of the skipper, smaller vessel size and larger family size significantly increase technical efficiency, but this is not yes for west coast. If these results hold yes in other artisanal fisheries with similar technology and environments, it would suggest that South East Asian gill net fishers are poor and efficient , but the factors that contribute to technical efficiency differ considerably by locality. The potential implications from our findings is that development projects targeted to artisanal fisheries must be locally-based and tailor made by region rather a broad and one size fits all approach to fisheries development. Further, the results suggest that targeted assistance to human and social capital and away from vessel and gear upgrades, may yield greater efficiency payoffs for artisanal fishers. Further, if the relatively high levels of technical efficiency found in the Malaysian gill net fishery exist in other artisanal fisheries, it suggests that targeted development assistance that has traditionally been focussed on the harvesting sector may be better directed to other priorities in artisanal fishing communities.",

    "description": "The Polynya1 (Mertz region) deepwater mooring was deployed on 2011-01-23 at (-66.20 S, 143.47 E) off the Adelie Land Coast in Antarctica, and was recovered in January 2015. In February 2014 a second array was deployed in a new location near the Totten Glacier.\n\nInstrumentation includes 75kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (RDI longranger ADCPs), and Seabird SBE37s (SM, SMP and SMP-ODO).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurement at four depth on each mooring, between the seafloor and 300m depth (the mooring are limited to this depth to avoid contact with icebergs).\n\nThis Polynya mooring array will re-continue the time series of bottom water export begun in 2008, using observation strategy, modified as required following recovery of the array in 2009.\n\nThe aim of the IMOS Polynya mooring array is to measure the export of dense Antarctic Bottom Water from the Adélie Land coast. Sinking of dense water near Antarctica supplies the deep branch of the global overturning circulation, a pattern of ocean currents that strongly influences climate. Several studies have recently shown that the properties of the bottom water in the Australian Antarctic Basin are changing. Monitoring the temperature, salinity and oxygen of bottom water will provide observations to detect how the Southern Ocean limb of the overturning circulation is responding to changes in high latitude climate forcing. The goal of the new Totten region location is to obtain measurements of \"warm\" inflow to, and (if possible) outflow from the Totten Glacier system. As it happened, access right to the Totten was not possible, and moorings were sited closer to the Dalton Iceberg Tongue and Moscow University Ice Shelf, possibly part of the Totten inflow story.",

    "description": "We recently discovered two new pulsars J1849+1001 (35.1 ms) and J1839+0542 (57.9 ms) in a FAST pulsar survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes (PT2020_0141). Follow-up timing observations show that they are in circular orbits with massive companions. This suggests that PSR J1849+1001 and J1839+0542 can be classified as the intermediate-mass binary pulsar (IMBP). Their massive companions also make them promising systems to measure \"Post-Keplerian\" parameters through pulsar timing. These Parkes observations will be combined with regular timing observations with FAST or MeerKAT to measure \"Post-Keplerian\" parameters and then measure both neutron star and companion masses.",

    "description": "\n\n\nGrasslands of the Territory include a rich assemblage of flora and fauna species that combine into a unique ecosystem. These grasslands are a priority for protection and management as they contribute to our natural biodiversity, our history and heritage, and local amenity and community. Natural Temperate Grasslands are an Endangered Ecological Community in the ACT (Nature Conservation Act 2014) and Critically Endangered Ecological Community under the EPBC Act 1999. Other native and exotic grasslands in the ACT can also have some conservation significance as they support important populations of threatened fauna and flora.\n\nNatural Temperate Grassland occurs in areas where few trees grow because of factors such as low temperatures, low rainfall and infertile or clay soils. Only 2% to 10% of the lower elevation grasslands in south-eastern Australia remain in high ecological condition, eight grassland species of the ACT are listed as endangered or vulnerable and some of the constituent plants and animals are under threat. Temperate grasslands are considered one of the most threatened Australian ecosystems. <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>. Extensive areas of native grassland in Namadgi National Park are to be field checked to determine whether they qualify as Natural Temperate Grassland. \n\nMore information on threatened species occurring in grasslands in the ACT can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>\n\nThe 2017 ACT <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/2547440/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans-2017.pdf\">Native Grassland Conservation Strategy</a> and associated action plans guide the protection, management and restoration of native grasslands and its component species for the next 10 years. See a <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans\">summary of the strategy</a>. This strategy supersedes Action Plan 28 ACT Lowland Native Grassland Conservation Strategy (Environment ACT, 2005).\n\nFit for purpose: This mapping is fit for use at a 1:10000 scale. Significant advances are being made towards a high resolution vegetation map for the ACT that is suitable for use at scales ranging from broad regional planning to local planning and property planning. However, Natural Temperate Grassland condition can fluctuate widely depending on seasonal conditions and thus boundaries and presence may fluctuate.\n\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the layers are free from error. © ACT Government\n",

The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2018 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the North East CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the North East Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Generation is defined as the capacity for existing mangrove forests and saltmarshes to contribute to carbon additionality from living biomass, dead organic material, and soil organic carbon. Several studies indicate that carbon addition is greater in mangrove forests than saltmarshes (Chmura et al., 2003; Pendleton et al., 2012), and this is likely due to greater height and biomass of mangroves compared to herbaceous saltmarsh vegetation. In NSW where both ecosystems occur, mangroves forests typically occupy lower positions within the tidal frame than saltmarshes, and their distribution can be defined based on elevation and hydroperiod (Hughes et al., 2019). Additionally, preservation of soil organic carbon within the contemporary range of mangroves has been found to be greater within fine grained sediments of fluvial origin than sandy coastal barrier sediments. \nChmura, G.L., Anisfeld, S.C., Cahoon, D.R., and Lynch, J.C.

    "description": "The Ourimbah Creek Floodplain Risk Management Plan has been prepared for the Central Coast Council in accordance with the NSW Government’s Floodplain Development Manual 2005 (Reference 1) and:\n Is based on a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of factors that affect and are\naffected by the use of flood prone land;\n Represents the considered opinion of the local community on how to best manage its flood risk and its flood prone land; and\n Provides a long-term path for the future development of the community.\n\nThe Ourimbah Creek catchment is located on the Central Coast of NSW, approximately 90km north of Sydney. Covering a total area of 160 km2, the majority of the catchment is contained in the Wyong Shire Local Government Area (LGA), with 8 km² of the catchment contained in the Gosford City LGA to the south. In 2016 the two councils were combined into the Central Coast Council.\n\nFlooding has been recorded periodically since the 1930’s but there are many more recorded instances of flooding in Tuggerah Lakes. It is possible that the incidence of flooding has historically been under reported along Ourimbah Creek and its tributaries. In recent times there have been two significant events, in February 1990 and June 2007. In both these events there was extensive flooding in the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Wyong/Gosford regions.\n\nFlooding causes significant hardship, including both tangible and intangible damages, to the community and for this reason the Central Coast Council has undertaken a program of studies to address the management of the flood problem in accordance with the NSW Government’s Floodplain Development Manual 2005 (Reference 1).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2007 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents projected population following the three projection series - the main projection, a high and a low  projection series for 5-year periods between the years of 2011 and 2036 for the state of New South Wales (NSW). The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe various projection series show the impact on the NSW population when the assumed levels of births, deaths and migration are changed. \nPopulation projections provide a picture of the population as it may develop in future years. They provide an indication of the size and age-sex structure of the future population if specified assumptions about future fertility, mortality and migration are realised. \nPopulation projections are not forecasts and do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors (whether in Australia or overseas) might have on demographic behaviour.\nFor more information please read the Population Projections User Guide.Please note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nPopulation numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. They should not be taken to be accurate to that level of detail.\n\n",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016 </b>\n\nThe Coastal Hazard (Storm Tide Inundation) Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "Under Section 22 of the Education Act 1990, parents have a legal duty to ensure their school-aged children attend school. Where absenteeism is persistent and an attendance improvement plan has been unsuccessful, and the parents have not meaningfully engaged with the plan, the matter is referred for consideration of legal action.\nData Notes:\n\n\nEach school has a discipline policy which sets out clear expectations for regular student attendance and consequences of truancy.\n\n\nWhere an attendance improvement plan has been unsuccessful in resolving the matter, and the parents have not meaningfully engaged with the plan, the matter is referred for consideration of legal action. \n\n\nProceedings are typically withdrawn when attendance has improved sufficiently to justify withdrawal, or because it appeared likely that a defence could be established (e.g. illness or disobedience).\n\n\nMatters not commenced occurred for a range of reasons including not being able to serve court papers, living arrangements for child changing, Family and Community Services removing children, improvement in attendance, and the student moving out of the jurisdiction.\n\n\nThese figures were prepared from administrative systems that were developed to internally track the progress of cases rather than to report externally. There are no statistical quality assurance measures applied to these figures, and there may be anomalies or errors due to the significant number of users who access the system. The data is correct to the best of the department’s knowledge and understanding.\n\n\nRefer to the individual publications for further information and policy context.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nLegal Services Directorate.

The primary objectives of this Flood Study are:\n• to define the flood behaviour of the North Creek catchment by producing information on\nflood levels, velocities and flows for a range of design flood events under existing\ncatchment and floodplain conditions,\n• to assess the hydraulic categories and undertake provisional flood hazard mapping,\n• to assess the extent of the flood problem by undertaking a damages assessment,\n• to formulate suitable hydrologic/hydraulic models that can be used in a subsequent\nFloodplain Risk Management Study to assess various floodplain management measures,\nincluding the effects of further development.\nThis report details the results and findings of the Flood Study investigations. The key elements\ninclude:\n• a summary of available data,\n• reasons for the choice of hydrologic and hydraulic models,\n• calibration of these models,\n• establishment of design flood behaviour,\n• flood damages assessment.\nThe Flood Study does not consider flooding from local drainage which may result from inadequate\nurban drainage provisions.",

    "description": "Hilltops Council (Council) commissioned the Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan for the township of Boorowa. The overall objectives of the Floodplain Risk Management Study (FRMS) were to assess the impacts of flooding, review existing Council policies as they relate to development of land in flood liable areas, consider options for the management of flood affected land and to develop a Floodplain Risk Management Plan (FRMP) which:\ni) Proposes modifications to existing Council policies to ensure that the development of flood affected land is undertaken so as to be compatible with the flood hazard and risk.\nii) Proposes Flood Planning Levels for the various land uses in the floodplain.\niii) Sets out the recommended program of works and measures aimed at reducing over time, the social, environmental and economic impacts of flooding.\niv) Provides a program for implementation of the proposed works and measures.\nThe FRMS focuses on Main Stream Flooding from the Boorowa River, Ryans Creek and Ryans Tributary, as well as two major un-named tributaries, Minor Tributary Flooding caused by high flows in the minor un-named tributaries which drain to the aforementioned watercourses, and Major Overland Flow areas which occur in the urbanised parts of Boorowa and its immediate surrounds.",

    "title": "Available Water Capacity for Australian Areas of Intensive Agriculture of Layer 1 (A-Horizon – Top-Soil)",
    "description": "    \n\nSurface of predicted Available Soil Water Holding Capacity of layer 1 (A\nHorizon a Top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.\nData modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State\nand CSIRO and presented as 0.01 degree grid cells. Available water capacity\n(AWC) is a measure of the store of water available for plants to use. AWC is\npresented here as the estimated total for the horizon, measured in millimetres\n(mm). The amount of water that is held by the soil varies according to a\nnumber of soil properties including, soil texture, organic matter content,\nbulk density and soil structure development. Available water capacity has been\ncalculated as the difference in volumetric water content at 0.1 bar and 15 bar\n(matric potentials of -10 kPa and -1.5 mPa) for each layer. These represent\nrespectively the field capacity (maximum water content following free\ndrainage) and the permanent wilting point (lower limit of soil moisture\navailable to plants). The final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic\nof all of the data obtained from various state and federal agencies. The\nsurfaces have been constructed with the best available soil survey information\navailable at the time. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One\nbeing that an area weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for\nthat polygon or map-unit. Another assumption made is that the look-up tables\nprovided by McKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict\nthe soil attribute values for each soil type. The digital map data is provided\nin geographical coordinates based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)\ndatum. This raster data set has a grid resolution of 0.001 degrees\n(approximately equivalent to 1.1 km). The data set is a product of the\nNational Land and Water Resources Audit (NLWRA) as a base dataset.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_awcaar9cl\n__06111a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The study was commissioned by the Albury City Council to inform the design of the South Albury levee upgrade. \n\nThis report supersedes previous flood studies for the Murray River at Albury and provides a revised flood frequency analysis of design flows, including calibration and sensitivity testing of the hydraulic model. The modelling shows that the proposed levee upgrades lead to improved flood protection in South Albury for events up to and including the 1% AEP (Annual Exceedance Probability) event. The flood mapping produced is intended to replace existing Murray River flood mapping and is considered fit for purpose to inform the levee's design.",

    "title": "Combined Effects of near-future temperature increase and ocean acidification on coral reef foraminifera Marginopora vertebralis and Heterostegina depressa. (NERP TE 5.2, AIMS and MARUM)",
    "description": "This dataset measures 5 effects of temperature and pH stressors (individual and combined) on tropical Foraminifera. The effects measured are: respiration, survivorship, growth, chl-a content and photochemistry. The study was conducted in 2011 and the data is provided as 5 single sheet spreadsheets.\n\nWarming and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry alter marine coastal ecosystems at an accelerating pace. Here we investigate the individual effects as well as the interaction of two stressors, temperature and pH on two species of benthic coral reef Foraminifera. This study consisted of a 7 week aquarium experiment manipulating temperature and pH changes and measuring survivorship, growth, photosynthesis, respiration and chl-a content in these benthic coral reef Foraminifera.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSpecimens were collected from Orpheus Island in the central Great Barrier Reef in September 2011. H. depressa was collected at a depth of 8¿12 m from coral rubble at Cattle Bay (18°34¿08¿¿ S 146°28¿55¿¿ E) and M. vertebralis at a depth of 0¿1 m (below Lowest Astronomical Tide) from turf algae-covered rocks at Hazard Bay (18°38¿58¿¿ S 146°29¿11¿¿ E). Both species were acclimated to laboratory conditions in tanks with moderate flow-through conditions (same as used in experimental setup) under low-light conditions (10 µmol photons m-2 s-1) for a period of 3 weeks.\n12 flow-through aquaria (working volume 17.5 L) were installed in a constant temperature room, and the experiment was carried out over a period of 53 d.\n\nSpecimens were kept inside custom made flow-through housings in each aquarium to achieve higher flow conditions more closely mimicking their habitat than in previous experiments. Flow-through housings contained two levels made from two standard 6-well cell culturing plates with flow-through lids. Twenty-four specimens (four specimens per well) of H. depressa were put in the lower level and the same number of M. vertebralis in the top level.\n\nFor each temperature (28 and 31 ºC) and pCO2 level (~790 µatm, pHNIST 7.9 and ~490 µatm, pHNIST 8.1), three replicate tanks were used; replicate tanks were randomly allocated to treatments. Seawater was pumped from the ocean into the laboratory, filtered to 5 µm, and stored in four header tanks where it was modified to the desired experimental conditions. Manual temperature and pH measurements were performed once to twice per day. Water samples for total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) determinations were taken weekly and analysed by AIMS Laboratory Services.\n\nFlow rates into the individual wells were recorded before and after the experiment, ranging between 180 and 220 mL min-1. Velocity of the water flow varied from 4.2¿5.2 9 10-1 m s-1 at the inlet (Ø 0.3 cm) to 3.1¿3.8 9 10-3 m s-1 at the outlet (Ø 3.5 cm). The flow rates between inlet and outlet are in the same range as those measured in situ over dead coral rubble and sea grass.\n\nFlow-through housings were made containing two levels so that one species could be kept in the top level exposed to higher light levels than the species in the lower level. Light levels were chosen for each species separately because of their known distributions and different light saturation points determined by pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry. PAM fluorometry results for M. vertebralis indicated a maximum saturating irradiance (Ek) between 100 and 140 µmol photons m-2 s-1 and for H. depressa between 40 and 60 µmol photons m-2 s-1 (Ziegler and Uthicke 2011). The light levels used in the experiment were chosen to fall below the Ek values by Ziegler and Uthicke (2011) and P¿I curve Pmax values determined by Vogel and Uthicke (2012) and were selected to correspond to levels which have shown no changes in mortality rates or chlorophyll a concentrations in previous experimental manipulations of the studied species.\n\nFurther detail can be found in this publication:\nSchmidt, C., Kucera, M., & Uthicke, S.

    "description": "This database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:100 000 scale) detailing places of potential National Estate aesthetic significance.\n\nAesthetic value is the response derived from the experience of the environment or particular natural and cultural attributes within it. This response can be to either visual or non-visual elements and can embrace emotional response, sense of place, sound, smell and any other factors having a strong impact on human thought, feelings and attitudes. (Australian Heritage Commission & Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 1994, p. 5) \n\nBefore the Comprehensive Regional Assessment (CRA), some 80 forest places having National Estate aesthetic significance had been identified in Tasmania. In most instances, however, this value had not been identified or corroborated through community consultation; rather, it had been determined through assessment by natural environment heritage experts. The information gathered during the CRA process, which enhances understanding of the significance of these places, will be amalgamated with existing information and may be used to refine the boundaries of places already on the Register of the National Estate. \n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criterion E1: Importance for a community for aesthetic characteristics held in high esteem or otherwise valued by the community.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

They appear to exert an influence on the location of the early Tertiary Renmark Group, on the deep leads and in themselves are controlled by underlying basement faults\".\n\nThe dataset was compiled by GHD to inform the report 'Potential Influences of Geological Structures on Groundwater Flow Systems' for DEPI's Secure Allocation Future Entitlements (SAFE) Project.",

    "description": "River basin catchment areas for Melbourne.  This layer has two intended purposes: To provide a readily available amalgamation of MWC_Catchments that make up the river basins within Melbourne Water’s area. Useful for larger scale plans and maps.Data for basin boundaries have been captured by relevant State and Territory authorities from 1:10 000 and 1:250 000 scale source material. The balance of the data are from Geoscience Australia's GEODATA Coast 100K which includes coastlines and State and Territory borders. Topographic Drainage Divisions and River Region boundaries are updated based on current research, data and technology. It references previous work of the Australian Water Resources Management Committee as shown in Australia's River Basins 1997. This work is a collaboration of scientists from the Bureau of Meteorology, Australian National University Fenner School of Environment and Society, CSIRO Water for Healthy Country Flagship and Geoscience Australia.In late 2008, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), in partnership with Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and the Australian National University (ANU) commenced the development of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric). Geofabric is being developed to underpin the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS) within a single, consistent, national geospatial framework for hydrological features. Geoscience Australia's role in the Geofabric is to provide the best available national topographic spatial data for surface water features based on the National Topographic Data and Map Specifications. The river basin boundaries have been aligned (by Melbourne Water) to Melbourne Water Corporation (MWC) drainage catchments, to produce a consistent drainage and waterways catchment dataset to State level, since 2005.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data. Melbourne Water Corporation shall not be liable in any way to any person or group for loss of any kind including damages, costs, interest, loss of profits or special loss or damage, arising from any use, error, inaccuracy, incompleteness or other defect in this data.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

These surveys will inform coastal modelling currently being undertaken as part of coastal design projects and may also be used to set-out coastal protection structures such as groyne extensions and seawalls encroaching below the low tide mark. \n\nThe survey requirements were to provide enough coverage within marked survey extents and high priority areas for each site to capture key bed features and the toe of any coastal structures up to -0.5m AHD. Additionally, the fringes of reefs within the marked areas were to be captured. To supplement this data, a number of survey profiles were specified for capture. The survey to be carried out to Class D requirements.\n\nThis site, Woody Point, refers to a 2.2km x 0.6km long section of coastline on the southern tip of the Redcliffe Peninsula and incorporates the Woody Point jetty. The survey area as identified through the specifications, including profiles, is contained within an area of 1.9km by 1.6km.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nGloucester Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input  and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.  The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of  equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. The surface water component of the zone was derived by selecting assessment units within 150m or sharing an alluvial floodplain with an impacted river reach.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing tweaks were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nA selection buffer of 300m was created from the potentially impacted reaches of the surface water modelling interpolated reaches polylines. This was unioned with polygons in the alluvium layer that intersected with the potentially impacted reaches to create the composite selection layer (included in component layer folder). The composite selection layer was manually edited to constrain the extent to that reasonably potentially influenced by changes in river. \n\n\n\nThe composite selection layer was used to select, by intersection, AUs that represented the surface water\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) GLO ZoPHC and component layers 20170217.

We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "Live release 1.0\r\n\r\nThis APS Career Pathfinder dataset contains the capability frameworks, role definitions and learning catalogues used by the [APS Career Pathfinder](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/aps-career-pathfinder-tool) tool to facilitate career exploration and development in the Australian Public Service (APS).\r\n\r\nThe role definitions include typical APS roles, which describe the skills and general capability requirements typically found in APS jobs based on those roles. You can use these definitions to determine potential career pathways and identify skills gaps and learning solutions that may help fill those gaps.\r\n\r\nThe focus at present is on digital roles, and therefore the capability frameworks, role definitions and the learning catalogue we are using primarily address digital, data and ICT. However, the APS Career Pathfinder tool has the capability to work with other types of capability framework, with roles and leaning mapped accordingly, so that it can support career exploration and development in potentially any area of capability.\r\n\r\nWe’ve defined roles according to skills drawn from capability frameworks, primarily [SFIA](https://sfia-online.org/en/), the Skills Framework for the Information Age. We use additional capability frameworks where relevant, including other skills frameworks (like [CIISec](https://www.ciisec.org/), the Chartered Institute of Information Security skills framework, and the [DCF](https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-data-capability-framework) Data Capability Framework), knowledge frameworks (like our simple knowledge magnitude scale), and behaviours (using the APS Work Level Standards). Additional details about roles include:\r\n\r\n* a brief description of each role or discipline\r\n* a mapping to the APS Job Family Model\r\n* a mapping to areas of interest\r\n* alternative names the roles may have\r\n* link to a ‘day in the life of’ profile for certain roles\r\n* relative role demand\r\n* link to learning solutions related to each role\r\n\r\nWe may define roles as typical APS roles, which are not specific to any agency, or as agency-specific roles. Agencies can include their role definitions in this dataset by sending their definitions to the contact email below.\r\n\r\nPlease send requests to change or augment any of this data to the contact email below. We may consult with our community before including them.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes the full SFIA framework, reproduced and made available through the [SFIA-AU](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/skills-framework-information-age) license. Use throughout Australia is permitted through this license, but may be restricted for foreign and multi-national organisations.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions. Various sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.",

Each BMAP asset is assigned a risk rating of either low, medium, high, very high, or extreme. Assets may be assigned risk reduction treatments to reduce their level of risk. Where risk reduction treatments are assigned, the agency or agencies responsible for the treatment are also specified. BMAP Assets are captured in three datasets: BMAP Asset Points, BMAP Asset Lines, and BMAP Asset Polygons. This allows assets to be represented as either points (for example, a communication tower) lines (for example, a pipeline) or polygons (for example, an area of houses located at an urban/rural fringe). Assets are broadly categorised according to their value as either a \"Human Settlement\", \"Economic Value\", or \"Social Value\" asset. This is referred to as the \"Asset Type\". There is one other Asset Type, \"Environmental\", however due to the very large number of environmental assets, those assets are stored in a separate dataset named BMAP Environmental Assets. BMAPs are defined in Section 73A of the Fire and Emergency Services Act 2005. BMAPs can be viewed on the Bushfire Management Area Plans page on the State Bushfire Coordination Committee (SBCC) website. Further information is available on the SBCC website. In particular, the publication named \"The Bushfire Management Area Plan Handbook 2018\" provides more information about BMAP Asset data.",

The updated TERN AET dataset (see https://www.tern.org.au/news-australia-wide-aet-data/) has several key improvements implemented which means it supersedes the Landsat-MODIS blended AET developed for the GBA Program.

    "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Synthesizing three decades of seagrass spatial data from Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait have globally significant seagrass habitat that provide food for threatened dugong and turtle, and habitat for commercially important fish and prawns. Key to understanding, managing, mitigating risk, and monitoring seagrass in this remote region is reliable data on seagrass distribution and species composition and how these changes through time. Data on seagrass has been collected in these areas since the 1980s, but data location and storage from these efforts remains disparate, in many cases not publicly available, and in some cases has already been lost. Our study will compile, validate and synthesize historical seagrass spatial data to create a publicly available database accessible on eAtlas. This product will provide end-users with a valuable spatial resource to assist management and monitoring of seagrass in the region. \n\n(i) Identify key seagrass habitat and migration corridors for dugong and turtles in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\n(ii) Identify regions where seagrass information is deficient (knowledge gaps)\n(iii) create a foundations for models assessing exposure to risk (water quality and other environmental impacts, climate change, etc)\n(iv) provide essential information for management, planning, and developing long-term monitoring plans\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • seagrass data [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC11) was collected from a depth of 502 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~30cm depth. From matching the 18O G. ruber curve with Martinson et al. (1987), 4 glacial cycles can be determined, incorporating Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 1 through to MIS 11. Isotopically heavier 18O values at ~460cm, ~345cm, 150cm, and 30cm correspond respectively to MIS 10, MIS 8, MIS 6 and the LGM. The d13C shows a trough lagging behind the 18O high during the glacial, although there are considerable fluctuations between MIS 8 and 6.",

    "description": "We request 15 hours of observing time with the Parkes UWL receiver (700-4000 MHz) to investigate frequency-dependent eclipsing in three spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs): one redback and two black widows. Spider MSPs commonly exhibit frequency-dependent eclipsing, which provides insights into their dense, magnetized plasma environments. We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "The Study Area\n\nThe study area comprises four sub-catchments within the Canterbury-Bankstown Council Local Government Area (LGA) that drain to Prospect Creek:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Georges Hall Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering approximately 145 hectares, this area predominantly features residential land with notable reserves, such as Crest Reserve and Garrison Point Reserve.</li>\n<li><strong>Lansdowne Sub-Catchment</strong>: Spanning 243 hectares, it includes residential areas alongside significant bushland and parklands, such as Lansdowne Park and Mirambeena Regional Park.</li>\n<li><strong>Miller Road Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering 50 hectares, this area includes residential zones with no defined water channels, relying on overland flow paths and a piped drainage network.</li>\n<li><strong>Villawood Sub-Catchment</strong>: The largest at approximately 740 hectares, this area comprises residential and industrial zones with a network of concrete-lined open channels.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA map of the study area is shown in Figure 1-2.\n\nConsultation\n\nCommunity and stakeholder consultation has been integral to this project. Key consultation activities included:\n<ul>\n<li>Engagement with the Floodplain Management Committee throughout the project phases;</li>\n<li>Community feedback collected through online surveys, email submissions, and in-person sessions, with a total of 67 recorded responses during initial consultation;</li>\n<li>Public exhibition of the draft study and plan, incorporating input from 57 engagements; and</li>\n<li>Targeted discussions on identified issues, such as voluntary house raising and stormwater management concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n\nModelling of Flood Behaviour\n\nCanterbury-Bankstown Council has implemented a consistent and advanced approach for modelling stormwater catchment flooding. The methodology integrates a dynamically linked 2D/1D hydrodynamic model (TUFLOW), which simulates flood behaviours with precision.\n\nThe TUFLOW model uses a two-dimensional grid to represent surface terrain while incorporating one-dimensional elements for stormwater pipes and channels. Overflow from drainage elements is accounted for, allowing flows to spill onto the grid and replicate overland and sheet flows across floodplains.\n\nFlood Risk Mapping &amp; Development Controls\n\nFlood risk mapping for the Prospect Creek sub-catchments categorises the area into three flood risk precincts, guiding development controls:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Areas prone to significant flood damages and evacuation challenges, where development is generally restricted.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Zones with moderate risk, where damages can be mitigated with suitable controls.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Regions with minimal risk where most developments are permitted, subject to planning regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAdditionally, overland flow precincts have been identified to account for shallow inundation areas, enabling tailored development controls.\n\nThe Flood Problem\n\nA comprehensive flood damages database was developed to evaluate flood impacts and inform flood mitigation strategies. Key findings include:\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 2,667 properties are impacted in the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event, with over 60% located in the Villawood sub-catchment.</li>\n<li>Average Annual Damages (AAD) across the sub-catchments exceed $93.7 million, with the Villawood sub-catchment contributing a significant portion due to its low-lying industrial areas.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFlood mitigation measures were assessed, and recommendations for effective floodplain management have been outlined to address these challenges.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Cape Wiles.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe CSP HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 237 deg true east of north (approximately north by north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "A deposit of weathered graphic granite at White Rocks, 2 miles south of Queanbeyan, was investigated and the limits of material in it suitable for easily quarryable road metal were determined. The area was divided into two sections: a northern one held for the most part by the Queanbeyan Council, and a southern section at present held privately as a grazing lease. \"Indicated\" reserves, based on the present quarrying level, of 170,000 cub. yds were established in the northern section. Most of this material will be of the same quality as that being quarried at present; some of the material towards the southern boundary of the lease will however be harder and require more blasting. In the grazing leases \"inferred reserves\" of 140,000 cub. yds. were delineated. It is expected that this material will be quite suitable for road making but may be slightly inferior in sizing to the material at present being quarried; also it may require more blasting in some portions than the material being quarried at present; it will carry a higher average overburden than the Queanbeyan lease.",

The classification system contains 11 easily identifiable and representative environments: Barrier/back-barrier, Central Basin, Channel, Coral, Flood- and Ebb-tide Delta, Fluvial (bay-head) Delta, Intertidal Flats, Mangrove, Rocky Reef, Saltmarsh/Saltflat, Tidal Sand Banks (and Unassigned). These types represent habitats found across all coastal systems in Australia. Most of the 54 coastal waterways have a \"Modified\" environmental condition (as opposed to \"Near Pristine\"), according to the National Land and Water Resources Audit definition.",

The new data was provided as dng cad file and included fuel lines, which was added to the relevant layers.\nData indicative only and not to be relied on.

    "description": "Geoscape G-NAF is the geocoded address database for Australian businesses and governments. It’s the trusted source of geocoded address data for Australia with over 50 million contributed addresses distilled into 15.4 million G-NAF addresses. It is built and maintained by [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using independently examined and validated government data. \r\n\r\nFrom 22 August 2022, Geoscape Australia is making G-NAF available in an additional simplified table format. [G-NAF Core](https://geoscape.com.au/data/g-naf-core/?utm_source=DISER&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=data.gov.au&utm_content=download+data&utm_campaign=G-NAF+core) makes accessing geocoded addresses easier by utilising less technical effort.\r\n\r\nG-NAF Core will be updated on a quarterly basis along with G-NAF.\r\n\r\nFurther information about contributors to G-NAF is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nWith more than 15 million Australian physical address record, G-NAF is one of the most ubiquitous and powerful spatial datasets. The records include geocodes, which are latitude and longitude map coordinates. G-NAF does not contain personal information or details relating to individuals.\r\n\r\nUpdated versions of G-NAF are published on a quarterly basis. Previous versions are available [here](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geoscape-geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf-previous-versions)\r\n\r\nUsers have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing either GDA94 or GDA2020 datums.\r\n\r\n**Changes in the November 2025 release**\r\n\r\n* Nationally, the November 2025 update of G-NAF shows an increase of 32,773 addresses overall (0.21%). The total number of addresses in G-NAF now stands at 15,827,416 of which 14,983,358 or 94.67% are principal. \r\n\r\n* There is one new locality for the November 2025 Release of G-NAF, the locality of Southwark in South Australia. \r\n\r\n* Geoscape has moved product descriptions, guides and reports online to https://docs.geoscape.com.au.\r\n\r\nFurther information on G-NAF, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/g-naf) or through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on G-NAF, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: On 1 October 2020, PSMA Australia Limited began trading as Geoscape Australia.\r\n\r\n##License Information\r\n\r\n[Use of the G-NAF downloaded from data.gov.au is subject to the End User Licence Agreement (EULA)](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf/resource/09f74802-08b1-4214-a6ea-3591b2753d30)\r\n\r\nThe EULA terms are based on the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the Corangamite CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure.
