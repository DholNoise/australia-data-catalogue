    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for Plant Health Australia  \r\n Overview  \r\n Experience from overseas indicates that the cost of an incursion by black-striped mussel is likely to be large without management. This report presents a comparison of the estimated costs associated with the alternative responses to an incursion: eradication and containment. Hypothetical incursions of black-striped mussel in ten case study areas across four Australian ports were considered. The cost of eradicating the initial mussel incursion from a case study area is compared to the cost of containing the mussel population to the port encompassing the case study area. The findings indicate that eradication is in most cases the preferred and less costly option over a range of time scales with the caveat that the likelihood of successful eradication will depend on early detection and response. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n•  Mytilopsis sallei  (black-striped mussel) is an invasive marine species that has been translocated from its native range in the Caribbean to a large number of ports in southern and eastern Asia. \r\n• An incursion of black-striped mussel in Darwin in 1999 was successfully eradicated at a cost of in excess of $3.2 million in 2012 terms. This species has been reported to have become established in a number of overseas trading ports, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai. The risks of translocation to Australia have therefore increased in recent years. \r\n• If an incursion by this species is not managed, it has the potential to cause significant and widespread economic and environmental damage. \r\n• A comparison of the costs associated with eradication with those of containment and control in a range of scenarios found that in many cases eradication is the preferred option, but containment and control may be preferred in some situations. \r\n",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

In the case of the 2nd and 3rd deployment the sampling interval was 15mins, while for the 4th deployment a sampling interval of 30mins was used. Unfortunately no data is available from the 1st deployment. \n\nThe tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~10m in all deployments. In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2014 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2014 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2013 – 30 June 2014, for others it will be the 2014 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nAs at November 2016, approximately 46 000 registered charities have submitted their 2014 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2014 reporting period. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS asked information about charity finances for the first time. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greated detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "title": "Parent record: Flow patterns within Jervis Bay: Summer deployment of current meters and tidal gauges",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe first of these six experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay during the summer months, when the waters are normally thermally stratified. This experiment consisted of 8 current meters in 3 moorings within the bay, along with pressure gauges to measure water levels and a meteorological station measuring winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head. The moorings were maintained for a single deployment from 6th December 1988 to 11th January 1989. [Given that this meteorological data bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nThe black, yellow and orange moorings held tidal gauges, while the red, blue and green moorings held current meters at various depths. The red mooring held current meters at ~6.5m, 10.5m, 14.5m and 18.5m, while the blue mooring held meters at ~5.5m and 11.5m and the green mooring at ~5.5m and 9.5m.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.  There are four subsidiary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n30915440-c321-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\nc5340590-c3b5-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\na4d79ad0-c3c1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\n08d650b0-c3f1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

However, in northern\r\nAustralia groundwater data for trend analysis are very sparse or non-existent.\r\nIn these regions, salinity assessments have been based on the presence of\r\ngeological, landscape, regolith, land use and climate attributes which are the\r\nprime drivers of salinity. This national map provides a basis for identifying\r\nthose regions where more detailed assessments are warranted, and where land\r\nuse changes should be targeted if the risks are to be managed.The bulk of non-\r\nagricultural areas in Western Australia, South Australia and western New South\r\nWales were considered to have a very low salinity risk and were not\r\nassessed.Please note that the Commonwealth and all suppliers of source data\r\nused to derive the maps of aAustralia, Forecast Areas Containing Land of High\r\nHazard or Risk of Dryland Salinity from 2000 to 2050a3 do not warrant the\r\naccuracy or completedness of information in this product. Any person using or\r\nrelying upon such information does so on the basis that the Commonwealth and\r\ndata suppliers shall bear no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any\r\nerrors, faults, defects or omissions in the information.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r9nn\r\nd_00211a00.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "#Updated September 2021 to include land use tiles. These tiles address issues with analysis of the large single dataset.#\r\n\r\nThis vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. \r\n\r\nThe vector geodatabase has been cut into 7 shapefile tiles. This reduces the file size and enables more analysis. The extent of tiles is shown below:  \r\n•\tSwan Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth West Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth Coast Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tNorthern Agricultural Region Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tPeel Harvey Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tAvon Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tRangelands Natural Resource Management region\r\n",

    "description": "This project will determine the movement and habitat use of large predatory fishes such as sharks and coral trout in reef and coastal environments of the Great Barrier Reef. This project will employ acoustic monitoring technology in a series of inshore and offshore environments including coastal bays, inshore reefs and offshore reefs to monitor the presence and movements of predator species (elasmobranchs and teleosts). Mobile predators will be fitted with acoustic transmitters to define their presence and distribution, extent of movement and amount of connectivity between study locations (i.e., movement from bay to inshore reef, movement among reef platforms, etc.).  Predator presence and movement will be integrated with habitat mapping and environmental monitoring data to identify factors that lead to changes in movement patterns and to define any preferred locations or conditions that can be targeted for conservation or management.  Examination of use of habitats will provide information about the amount of time spent in various GBRMP zones and amount of movement among zones to assess the amount of protection provided under current management arrangements.",

White box - Yellow box - Blakely's red gum grassy woodland and derived grassland is a Critically Endangered Ecological Community under the EPBC Act 1999. The criteria for the EPBC community is slightly different to the ACT listed of the community Yellow box-Blakely's red gum grassy woodland and derived grassland community. \nMapping represents 'potential' distribution of the threatened ecological community (tec) as listing status of this community must be verified with field inspection.\nMapping product supersedes mapping completed by Maguire and Mulvaney in 2012 (see <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf\">https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf</a>).\nCaveat: This layer is indicative of likely habitat for threatened grassy box woodlands in the ACT but may not reflect the full distribution. Lack of identification of this community at a site does not necessarily indicate that the community does not occur there.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2021 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2021 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2021 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "title": "ACTGOV RFMP - Fuel Break Upgrades",
    "description": "This dataset displays the position and extents of fuel breaks that have been identified to be upgraded in the RFMP 2019-28. Strategic fuel breaks are usually located between assets and surrounding rural areas or bushland. Fuel breaks typically consist of an area of variable width next to an existing track or road where bushfire fuels are maintained at lower levels. The lower fuel levels within fuel breaks result in much reduced fire behaviour. In this way, they provide a defensible space in which fire fighters may work with increased safety to protect assets, usually associated with back-burning activities during fire suppression operations. They also provide an opportunity to ‘break-up’ fire runs and assist with prescribed burning operations.",

Data are obtained from in-situ data loggers deployed on the reef. Data loggers instantaneously record sea temperatures every 30 minutes and are exchanged and downloaded approximately every 12 months. Temperature loggers on the reef-flat are generally placed just below Lowest Astronomical Tide level. Reef-slope (or where specified as Upper reef-slope) generally refers to depths 5 - 9 m while Deep reef-slope refers to depths of ~20 m.",

    "description": "This report describes the hydraulic modelling for the first stage of a flood study of the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley commissioned by the Water Board in 1987. The study is required in order to \"determine the effects that various arrangements of major or future works for Warragamba Dam have on flooding in the valley\" (Revised Brief for the Preparation of an E.I.S., Water Boards August 1987). Stage 1 required a simplified model to be developed, calibrated and used to provide a measure of the relative effects on flooding of options for such works.\nThe model used is described in Section 2. Section 3 describes the calibration phase, in which three historical floods were used to adjust model parameters in order to match historical and modelled flood heights. The various options for Warragamba Dam flood protection works have an impact on the outflow hydrographs from the dam. Outflow hydrographs were determined for each option for five \"design\" floods and run through the calibrated hydraulic model. Peak flood heights were then tabulated and compared at three key locations In the valley. Section 4 describes the options while Section 5 discusses the modelling methods used to run these cases. The results are presented as a series of tables and graphs.",

    "title": "Fish Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP3, a 6m steel pole, which has been installed within a small bommie in Third Lagoon on One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions. \n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on One Tree Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on Heron Island (near by), Orpheus Island (central GBR) and Lizard Island (northen GBR). A light sensor is also located on the island itself to give measures of PAR.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NW section of Jervis Bay (35.03S, 150.7E) between 6/12/88 and 11/1/89. This mooring held two water current metres: an S4 Interocean current meter at a depth of 5.5m, and an Aanderaa (RCM7) meter at a depth of 9.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided in the datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nThe Aanderaa meter at 9.5m should have provided eastern and northern tidal components over the duration of the sampling period, however the compass jammed and did not work at all. Water speed was recorded but gives no indication of the direction of water movement.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 9.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 ¿ 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980¿s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ¿non-targeted¿ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target¿ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ¿grazers¿  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "###Update March 2025###\r\n\r\nFrom 25 March 2025, the dataset update frequency has change from monthly to weekly every Tuesday.\r\n\r\n###Update April 2022###\r\n\r\nWe have replaced the .xlsx file resources for all our datasets. This was required due to the API and web page search functionality no longer being supported for .xlsx files on the Data.Gov platform.\r\n\r\n***\r\n###Dataset summary###\r\n\r\nASIC is Australia’s corporate, markets and financial services regulator. ASIC contributes to Australia’s economic reputation and wellbeing by ensuring that Australia's financial markets are fair and transparent, and supported by confident and informed investors and consumers.\r\n\r\nThe Banned and Disqualified Persons Dataset file on data.gov.au is extracted from ASIC's Banned and Disqualified Registers. This dataset is a point in time snapshot of the Banned and Disqualified Persons Register data.\r\nThe dataset provides information on persons that are:\r\n\r\n* disqualified from involvement in the management of a corporation\r\n* disqualified from auditing Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) and\r\n* banned from practising in the Australian Financial Services (AFS) or credit industry.\r\n\r\nIt also provides information about persons that have been:\r\n\r\n* banned from the AFS or credit industry and\r\n* banned from the credit industry by a state or territory.\r\n\r\nInformation provided in this search is taken from the following registers:\r\n\r\n* disqualified persons register\r\n* credit banned/disqualified persons register\r\n* AFS banned/disqualified persons register\r\n* banned securities representatives register (pre-AFS licences)\r\n* banned futures representatives register (pre-AFS licences).\r\n\r\nSelected data from the registers will be uploaded each week to www.data.gov.au. The data made available will be a snapshot of the register at a point in time. Legislation prescribes the type of information ASIC is allowed to disclose to the public.\r\n\r\nThere may be multiple instances of identical or similar names in the dataset, with slight differences in address, place of birth, and other details. The data is recorded as it was reported to ASIC and we cannot confirm if these similar records are/are not the same person. \r\n\r\nThe information in the downloadable dataset includes:\r\n\r\n* Register name\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Name\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Type\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Document Number\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Start Date\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons End Date\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Address Locality\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Address State\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Address Post Code\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Address Country\r\n* Banned and Disqualified Persons Comments\r\n\r\nAdditional information about Banned and Disqualified Persons can be found via [ASIC's website](http://www.asic.gov.au/ \"ASIC website\").

    "title": "ACTGOV Mature Tree 2020 Crowns",
    "description": "This dataset shows mature tree crown polygons across Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) derived from 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model. Mature Tree crowns are defined as those larger than 100m2 canopy footprint, and higher than 8 metres tall. Includes native and non-native tree representation and estimates height. Also see <a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1c62bf7c475748afb1ca5b1ae2239afd\">Mature Tree Centre Points.</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Methods:</strong>\nThe canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. Tree crowns were delineated using a one metre 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model (CHM) via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynn 2004; Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020).A 3X3 low pass smoothing algorithm was applied to the CHM raster. The CHM was then loaded into R and manipulated using the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020). A variable window filter, which was used in parallel with watershed segmentation, was applied to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The following metrics was used for the variable window:function(x){((x^2)* 0.009 + 2.5)}. A minimum height of 3 metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The watershed segmentation method was implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting segmented raster was converted to a simplified polygon layer, and joined with the treetops point layer. Polygons smaller than 3 square metres were removed. Tree crown polygons larger than 100m2 and higher than 8 metres were filtered as &quot;mature trees&quot;. Dataset represents native and non-native species.\n\n\n\n<b>Tree Crown Delineation Method</b>\nThe inverse watershed delineation (IWD) method is the popular technique for segmenting individual tree crowns using LIDAR data (Marcu, et al., 2017) (Wannassiri, et al., 2013). LiDAR-based IWD methods have been successfully applied in conifer-dominated systems, while broadleaf-dominated systems have proven to be more challenging (Hastings, et al., 2020). A common problem with the IWD method is the overestimation of tree crowns, especially in dense tree stands. This problem can be partially overcome by a) aggressively filtering the data, and b) using a variable window filter (VWF) algorithm to detect dominant treetops, which then feeds into the IWD.\nIn this project, 2015 and 2020 tree crowns were delineated from the respective CHM’s, via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynne, 2004) implemented via the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel, 2021). The R-code used in this project is included in metadata lineage.\nA variable window filter was applied within the ForestTools package to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a variable moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, and the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The derivation of the appropriate window size to search for treetops is based on the assumption that there is a relationship between the height of the trees and their crown size. The higher the trees, the larger the crown size.\nVarious functions were tested to define the window search radius, including simple linear functions. The function described by Popescu &amp; Wynne was eventually chosen to inform the window search radius of the tree top detection algorithm, as it achieved the best results for mature trees.\nA minimum height of three metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The IWD method was then implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting raster dataset contained unique identifies corresponding with the tree tops point dataset. The ensuing segmented rasters were converted to polygon layers and joined with the treetops point layers.\n\n<b>Delineated Tree Crown Model Validation</b>\nMap products produced by remote sensing analysis typically uses ‘ground truth’ to determine accuracy. In practice, accuracy assessments evaluate the remote sensing-derived map product relative to some higher quality determination of the map. These higher quality data, referred to as ‘reference data’, is compared to the map product using statistical sampling (Stehman, 2009).\nValidation of the 2015 mature tree crown polygons was done by randomly selecting 40 points from the dataset and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons (digitized from 2015 aerial photography). The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 32 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 8 of the reference polygons. The overestimation of the canopy projective area by the delineation model can be partly attributed to the low pass filter that was used to smooth the canopy height model during the delineation process, which effectively added pixels to the perimeter of tree crowns in the CHM.\nA similar process was followed to validate the 2020 mature tree crown model, using the same 40 randomly selected points and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons from 2020 aerial photography. The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 33 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 7 of the reference polygons.\nAlso see\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2f277dfd24964ef3943d99b34c38ebad\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 1m - Districts - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2eb04c29f971499aa3aebe4abaa36059\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 Statistics - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li></ul>\n\nReferences:\nPlowright, A &amp; J Roussel.

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover spatial datasets, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and Territory agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to the states' and territories' data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nForests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and the Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002. The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n ABARES has produced a report containing the results of analysis of beekeeping financial and physical performance data collected from beekeeping businesses in 2015-16. Key performance measures for beekeeping businesses are presented, including analysis of pollination services, use of public lands, challenges facing the beekeeping industry and the extent to which research and information is sought and implemented. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES Australian Honey Bee Industry Survey conducted in 2016. It provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing the current situation of Australian beekeeping businesses, as well as monitoring changes from previous surveys conducted in 2002 and 2008. \r\n\r\n The survey was funded by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, as part of the Australian Government's response to a recommendation from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report from 2014 on the future of the beekeeping and pollination service industries in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Over 13,000 registered beekeepers operate across Australia. The number of commercial beekeepers fell by 25 per cent over the 10 years to 2015-16. \r\n• Most honey produced came from non-agricultural private land (39 per cent) or public land (39 per cent). 23 per cent was produced from agricultural land. Larger businesses were more likely to derive a greater proportion of total honey produced from public land. \r\n• The majority of beekeeping cash receipts came from honey sales (85 per cent) in 2014-15. Cash receipts from paid pollination were the second largest component of receipts (11 per cent). Business cash income averaged $70 400 and was significantly higher in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. \r\n• Small operators had negative business profit and rate of return in 2014-15, while small-medium, medium and large operators experienced increasingly large positive rates of return and business profit. \r\n• Paid pollination was conducted by around 44 per cent of beekeepers in 2014-15. The proportion of beekeepers and the value of payments received were higher in areas that produced large amounts of bee-pollination dependent crops such as almonds and cherries. \r\n• Drought was the most commonly cited challenge to honey production by beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 (70 per cent of beekeepers). Half of beekeeping businesses indicated that the use of agricultural chemicals negatively impacted floral resources available and thus their honey production. \r\n• The most common disease and pest affecting beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 were chalkbrood and the small hive beetle. The greatest financial impacts were caused by the small hive beetle and American foulbrood. \r\n• Nearly three quarters of beekeeping businesses changed their management practices in 2014-15 as a result of research. Large businesses were more responsive to research findings than smaller operators. \r\n",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the south central section of Jervis Bay between 10/07/90 and 30/08/90. This 'Red' mooring (35.0872 S, 150.7333 E) held three S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately two datasets are missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 6.5m have not been located, as neither have the 10min sample readings for the meter at 10.5m**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "A 6m galvanized pole has been deployed in the eastern part of the lagoon in behind Seabird Islet. \n\nThe Relay Pole has three functions. The first is to propagate the wireless network through which the buoys talk and so it forms part of the network backbone talking directly to Relay-Pole 1. The second function is that a vaisala WXT520 weather station is mounted on the top and so this pole provides above water met observations. These include air temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction and rainfall.\n\nThe third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex.\n\nThe pole has two Campbell Scientific loggers (one for the weather station, one for the sensors), spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station). The sensor string as of August 2010 has a SeaBird SBE37 at the end of the sensor string (around 230m out from the pole), and two SeaBird SBE39's located at teh reef crest and down at the start of the reef slope.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The record describes data collected from a summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored in the central part of Jervis Bay, New South Wales (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the summer deployment, 13th December 1990 to 15th January 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 15 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.  \n\nThree resources are provided: 1) A schematic of depth bin locations for the summer deployment, 2) Unfiltered east/west and north/south current values for every 15 minutes of the experiment, and 3) Low-pass filtered east/west and north/south hourly current values to remove tidal period motion. The filter has a half amplitude response at 32 hours and 48 hourly weights.\n\nThis child record relates to the parent, b146e140-2ae6-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for August 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "Overview  \r\nAustralia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 report presents forecasts of sawlog and pulplog volumes available from softwood and hardwood plantations. Changes in log availability have important implications for Australia's rural economies; the size, type and geographical location of wood and paper product manufacturing industries; the national supply of wood products; Australia's trade balance; and Australia's export income. \r\n\r\n This report has been prepared by ABARES under the auspices of the National Plantation Inventory--a program that has collected data and reported on plantations established primarily for wood production in Australia since 1993. Comprehensive plantation log availability forecast reports are published every five years and Australia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 is the fifth log supply report. \r\n\r\n In this report, forecasts are presented for softwood and hardwood sawlog and pulplog volumes by National Plantation Inventory region, based on the combination of forecasts supplied by plantation owners and managers through a survey and ABARES modelled forecasts. For the modelled forecasts, ABARES did not account for any future changes in social, economic or environmental parameters. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The potential log availability from Australia's commercial plantation estate is forecast to increase to an annual average of 29.7 million cubic metres in the 2015-19 period, followed by a decline to an annual average of 27.0 million cubic metres a year for the 2020-24 period. The 2015 to 2059 average total plantation log availability forecast is 10 per cent lower in this report, compared with the 2012 log supply report; the average hardwood log availability forecast is 21 per cent lower and the average softwood log availability forecast is 2 per cent lower. \r\n• The majority of the decline in total log availability is because the expected yield from hardwood plantations is forecast to decline as plantations of low commerciality are not replanted and some lease agreements with landholders are not renewed. \r\n• ABARES estimates that the total commercial plantation estate may decrease by around 80 000 to 100 000 hectares over the next 10 to 15 years as new plantation establishment will not be sufficient to offset removals of low commerciality plantations unless there are new drivers to expand or maintain the current plantation estate. \r\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nACT Climate refugia are core areas of the landscape most likely to support persistence of dominant trees, shrubs and grasses of the Capital Region under climate change.\nThe data identify refugia expected to support climate sensitive species characteristic of each vegetation community, both now and into the future, based on distribution modelling using NARCLiM climate projections (MacKenzie et al 2019).\nThe areas shown (refugia) highlight where the most stressed subset of dominant plant species today (i.e., common trees, shrubs and grasses modelled to lose &gt;= 75% of their current distribution) are more likely to persist under a wide range of future climate scenarios. These refugia can be used to prioritise management actions to minimise further stresses to those communities (e.g. prescribed burning within tolerable fire intervals; climate-adaptive revegetation programs, etc). Note: Areas smaller than 0.5 hectares have been removed to enable quicker map drawing, contact officeofnatureconservation@act.gov.au for the full dataset, including ensemble forecasts for individual plant species (n=151).\nSource Technical Report:\nMacKenzie, J.B., G.

    "description": "\n\n\nHabitat Patches: The patches have been identified through use of an effective habitat area analysis. This analysis reflects the generalist habitat condition assigned to every 15m grid cell across the ACT region and the context or combined habitat values of the grids that surround it or are in its near vicinity. Patches are defined by polygons that include all adjoining grid cells that are in the highest 20% for spatial context for all grid cells across the ACT Region. The legend indicates patches that are &gt;10ha or that are from 5 – 10 ha.  Indicates resource availability for an animal at that cell.\nThe ACT connectivity mapping was undertaken by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A full study report has been produced, and is entitled Fine Scale Modelling of Fauna Habitat and Connectivity Values in the ACT Region. This study built upon an earlier report entitled the Ecological Connectivity for Climate Change in the ACT and surrounding region, commissioned by the ACT Government as part of Weathering the Change Action Plan 1. The report was undertaken by the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University. It is recommended that both reports be consulted when use is being made of the connectivity mapping available. Reports can be downloaded from the EPD website at https://www.act.gov.au/environment/research-and-data/conservation-research-and-technical-reports (Technical reports 21 and 27).\ngen_blank20pc_ctx \nGridcode\n0 = &lt;10ha\n1 = &gt;10ha\nPatchcode\n-1= Not a patch\n0= Patch 5-10ha\n1= Patch 10ha&lt;\nUpdates: This dataset is static.\nFit for purpose: 2012 temporal coverage.

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "Lizard Island is located in the Northern Great Barrier Reef province, approximately 270km north of Cairns. Reef drilling was undertaken to investigate the Holocene evolution of the fringing reefs of Lizard Island. Radiocarbon dating of the cored coral material was then used to establish the chronology of the reef and to quantify the rate of development. \n\nThree drill cores were extracted, all from the windward margin because the leeward margin was too deep to access and did not form a conventional reef flat margin. The maximum depth reached was 4.5 m in core L1, with cores L2 and L3 being abandoned after encountering thick sand layers. \n\nThe cores were logged and photographed, and thin sections were made and petrographically examined. Corals that were determined to be in situ (by the orientation of their corallites) and free from internal cement and detritus by microscope examination were selected for radiocarbon dating.\n\nRadiocarbon dates indicate that the fringing reef at Lizard Island started growing directly on an assumed granite basement approximately 6.7 cal kyr BP at approximately 4.5 m below the reef flat surface. The windward margin at Lizard Island approached modern day sea level approximately 4 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 m/kyr at Lizard Island.",

    "title": "Derelict fishing line on fringing reefs of inshore groups of the GBR, 2007-2009 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site means of the density of derelict fishing line, the percent cover of major benthic categories on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, and the accumulation rate of fishing line at ten sites in the Palm Islands between 2007 and 2009. \r\n\r\nMonofilament nylon fishing line is persistent in the marine environment and once entangled in the reef, it can remain in place for many years. Temporal monitoring of the relative number of fishing lines recorded at each site can be used as a proxy for fishing effort. During the last few years we have established a collaboration with ReefCheck Australia to enhance this aspect of the project. In 2007, volunteer divers were tasked with removing all derelict fishing lines from a subset of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands.  In the last few years, the rate of line re-accumulation has been monitored to gauge relative levels of fishing effort and zoning compliance. \r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey derelict fishing lines at 30 sites in the Palm Islands, 42 sites in the Whitsunday Islands and 22 sites in the Keppel Islands during 2009.  Within each island group, half of the sites (n = 47) were located on reefs within NTMRs and half  (n = 47) were on reefs that are open to fishing (non-NTMR).  A proportion of the NTMR sites in each island group were located within ¿old¿ reserves (NTMR 1987) protected since 1987; while others were located within ¿new¿ reserves (NTMR 2004) protected since 2004.\r\n\r\nFive replicate 50 m x 6 m (300 m²) UVC transects were surveyed at each monitoring site by two observers using SCUBA.  The total survey area at each site was 1500 m2.  Transect tapes were deployed along reef slopes, parallel to the reef crest and at a depth between 4 m and 9 m depending on the reef slope topography at each site.\r\nThe benthic community was surveyed using a standard line intercept survey method every 1 m along each transect (50 points per transect). Hard corals were classified as live or dead and assigned into morphological categories (branching, digitate, plate, massive, foliose, encrusting). Other categories of benthos included soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand. Reef structural complexity was estimated using a five-point scale for both reef slope angle and rugosity. Five independent structural complexity estimates were made for each transect. Underwater visibility was recorded on each transect and ranged from 6 m to 12 m. Surveys did not proceed if the visibility was less than 5 m.\r\n\r\nTeams of volunteer divers from Reef Check Australia carried out the removal of derelict fishing lines at ten of the monitoring sites in the Palm Islands during April 2007. Five of the cleaned sites were located on reefs within NTMRs and five were on non-NTMR reefs. Four of the cleaned NTMR sites were located on the leeward side of Orpheus Island (NTMR 1987) and one site was at Curacoa Island (NTMR 2004). Of the cleaned non-NTMR sites, four were located on the leeward side of Pelorus Island and one was at Curacoa Island. The ten cleaned sites were randomly selected from a pool of eighteen sites that were in sheltered (leeward) locations and were identified as being readily accessible by fishers during calm to moderate (< 15 knots of wind) weather conditions. \r\n\r\nAt each site, divers removed all sighted derelict fishing lines and tackle (hooks, sinkers, wire leaders etc.) on reef slopes between 4 m and 12 m depth, for 200 m in both directions from a central GPS waypoint marking the site position. Transect tapes were deployed to measure the distance covered and increase the search efficiency so that very few, if any, derelict fishing lines remained after cleanup operations were completed. Derelict lines that were overgrown with hard coral or encrusting sponges, or partially embedded in the reef matrix were cut, and all of the exposed (visible) sections of line were removed. All collected fishing lines were recorded on data sheets before being placed in catch bags and taken back to the boat for later disposal.  \r\n\r\nBaseline UVC surveys of derelict fishing lines were conducted at each of the ten cleaned sites immediately prior to the removal of fishing lines in April 2007 and UVC surveys were subsequently repeated in December 2009, providing a 32 month period for fishing lines to re-accumulate on the reefs.  The 2007 and 2009 UVC surveys on the 10 cleaned sites used the same methodology described in the survey methods section above.  \r\n\r\nWe assumed that all of the fishing lines recorded and collected were lost at the same location in which they were found.  The authors recognize that the removal of derelict fishing line from ten of the thirty sites in the Palm Islands prior to the 2009 surveys would have reduced the fishing line density estimates for the Palm Islands.  However the magnitude of this effect was balanced between old and new NTMRs and non-NTMRs, as only one-third of the monitoring sites in each zone were cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (20 kB). All benthic data is in % cover. Fishing line data are presented as both mean density (mean number of lines per 300 m2) and a total summed value for each site (total number of lines recorded per 1500m2). The first worksheet provides the site-level data for 2009. The second worksheet provides the accumulation rates of fishing lines at 10 monitoring sites in the Palm Islands between their removal in 2007 and the re-survey in 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in brackets correspond to those used in the shapefile equivalents of the spreadsheet data. These names were adapted to work within the 10 character attribute limitation of shapefiles.\r\n- Fish Line_MEAN (FishLineMn) - mean number of lines recorded over 5 transects surveyed at each 300 m2 site.\r\n- Fish Line_SUM (FishLinSum) - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. It is the total number of lines found over the 1500m2 surveyed at each site.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate (LineAccRat) - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n- SCI_MEAN - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The data provided is site means¿ i.e. the mean of those 25 values.\r\n- %LHC_MEAN (LHC_MEAN) - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans R.D., Hill J.K., Russ G.R.

No data has changed.\r\n \r\nThis package of nationally consistent Australian spatial layers at one-kilometre resolution contains publicly available national data for use with MCAS-S up until December 2022. It replaces the 2014, 2011 and 2009 MCAS-S data packs. The downloadable zip file (1GB unzips to 4GB) contains a sample MCAS-S project alongside a data folder. Within the data folder are more than 290 layers in four sub-folders: Primary (raster data in GeoTIFF format for analysis) ~269 layers, Mask (raster data in GeoTIFF format for reporting and restricting the view) ~13 layers (note that categorical primary layers can now be used as masks by modifying the .tip file), Overlay (vector data in shapefile format – point, line, or polygons for context) ~17 layers, and Classified (empty folder for storage of layers created by using MCAS-S).\r\nThe layers in the Data pack are listed in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet MCAS-S-datapack2022-contents.xlsx.\r\nFor instructions to use this data pack read the descriptive metadata.\r\n\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: ABARES 2022, Multi-Criteria Analysis Shell for\r\nSpatial Decision Support MCAS-S Data pack – update 2022, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and\r\nSciences, Canberra, December 2022 CC BY 4.0.

Generally, these features will have a width of 3 metres of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface, corners of sufficient radius to make 3-point turns by light units unnecessary.\nProposed Walking Track - Allow the safe passage of fire fighters on foot. Generally, these features will be less than 1m in width, of natural, grass, sealed or gravel surface and with vegetation maintained to allow single-file walking.\nUpgraded Rigid Float - To allow the safe passage of a rigid body truck carrying a D4 or equivalent sized bulldozer or machinery. Generally, these features will have the same characteristics as tanker roads but will have smaller rollovers and no switchback corners.",

Approval must be received before pruning or any other activity that could cause damage to a protected tree.\n\nThe ACT Tree Register has been established to protect trees of individual importance across the built-up urban area. The ACT Tree Register can be found on the CED website. A registered tree has been identified as being exceptional for it’s:\n\n- Natural or cultural heritage values;\n\n- Landscape and aesthetic value; and/or\n\n- Scientific and ecological value.\n\nThe Conservator of Flora and Fauna will make the decision regarding the registration of trees. The trees are assessed and if they meet the criteria, they will be placed on the Provisional Tree Register before a decision is made on full registration, within 12 months.\n\nAttributes include status, botanical name, land use, custodianship, division, district, tree height, canopy diameter, trunk circumference, registration date and criteria. These assets are captured and maintained in the asset database through the nomination of trees to the ACT Tree Register.\n\nFor additional information, please see relevant details below:\n\nACT Government City Services website\n\nhttps://www.cityservices.act.gov.au/trees-and-nature/trees/act_tree_register",

    "description": "Ambulance Victoria has two official response time targets: Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 85% of incidents state-wide, and\nRespond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 90% of incidents in centres with populations greater than 7,500. Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1,\" and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nUrban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population.\nAmbulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population\nexceeds 7,500 persons.",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed. The trial ended when the focal male touched the tethered individual (approach), or after 5 minutes passed with no approach (ignore). The order of the two trials (neighbour or stranger) was random. 80 experiments were conducted in total, 20 of each of the following combinations: i) male -- neighbouring male, ii) male -- strange male, iii) male -- neighbouring female, iv) male -- strange female. \n\nThe results indicate that males treat female neighbours differently to male neighbours and intruders (of either sex). They were less likely to approach a female neighbour than an unknown female tethered in the same spot. They were equally likely to approach an unknown female, a neighbouring male and an unknown male.",

    "title": "Amphibians Remnant Patches",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Melbourne CBD - East in VIC with SA2 code 206041503, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This technical report uses farm survey data to measure the contribution of cross-farm resource reallocation to industry-level productivity growth within Australian broadacre agriculture. The results show that resource reallocation between farms accounted for around half the industry-level productivity growth that occurred between 1978 and 2010, and its contribution appears to have increased over time. This effect is mainly caused by the asymetric impact of technological progress on incumbent farms, as reflected in difference in productivity growth and the relative mobility of different production factors. These findings provide useful insights for policy-makers considering industry-level reforms as a means of imrpving aggregate agricultural productivity. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for September 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a08.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

Having defined preferred and non-preferred terms within sport is intended to promote consistency in terminology across the entire sporting community. While at this stage it is called a Thesaurus, in the longer term it is hoped that the product becomes a sports metadata register for the purpose of creating data standards for data exchange and interoperability. \r\n\r\nThe _Australian Sports Thesaurus_ seeks to provide clarity and assistance to the sport community by:\r\n1. ensuring consistency of understanding and usage of sport terminology in documentary, legal and commercial discussions\r\n2. enabling improved system and database interoperability and reporting \r\n3. facilitating search and retrieval of information from sport information systems \r\n4. facilitating the defining of sport data for Data Dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThe terms and definitions are where relevant linked by the following relationships:\r\n+Preferred term\r\n+Non-preferred term\r\n+Broader term\r\n+Narrower term\r\n+Related term\r\n",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU sugar industry, EU almond industry and investment on Australia's farms. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 3.3 per cent to around $58.4 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 3.8 per cent increase to $56.5 billion in 2015-16. If realised, the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 13 per cent higher than the five-year average of $51.8 billion between 2011-12 and 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to remain largely unchanged at $29.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 6.6 per cent to $29.2 billion in 2016-17. This mainly reflects forecast increases in the gross values of horticulture, cotton and oilseed production offsetting forecast decreases in the gross values of wheat and barley production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to fall slightly to $44 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.3 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.5 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to fall in 2016-17 are beef and veal (-12 per cent), dairy products (-1 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (-4 per cent), chickpeas (-32 per cent) and mutton (-17 per cent). Export earnings for wheat are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• The forecast decreases in 2016-17 are expected to be partly offset by forecast rises in export earnings for wool (6 per cent), sugar (21 per cent), wine (1 per cent), cotton (40 per cent), lamb (3 per cent) and canola (43 per cent). \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 8 per cent to $1.7 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.8 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia averaged 2.9 per cent in 2015-16 and is assumed to average 2.7 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2016-17, largely unchanged from the estimated average for 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU sugar industry  \r\n• The EU sugar market is highly regulated, with domestic price support, export subsidies and import restrictions. This stocktake of EU domestic and trade policies that support the EU sugar market will inform government and industry in the lead up to the commencement of Australia-EU FTA negotiations. \r\n• Australia's access to the EU sugar market is constrained by a country-specific tariff rate quota. Any improved access through either lower tariffs or increased quota would improve Australia's competitiveness in that market. \r\n\r\n The EU almond industry  \r\n• The European Union is the world's largest consumer and importer of almonds and has been a growing export market for Australian almonds since 2005-06. \r\n• However, significant benefits from an Australian-EU FTA are unlikely for Australian almonds because import tariffs are already low and equal to those faced by the United States, the main supplier to this market. \r\n\r\n Investment in Australian farms  \r\n• Investment in Australian farms is substantial, with net additions of non-land capital items on broadacre and dairy farms currently worth around $2 billion a year. \r\n• Farm operators and their spouses provide most of the capital used to fund the ownership and operation of Australian farms; corporate investors account for less than one-fifth of total capital. The strength of the family farm business structure suggests that corporate investors are unlikely to significantly displace family farmers in the near future. \r\n",

    "description": "## This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at March 2014. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (1997 to 2012) and scale of mapping (1:25 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 7, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. ",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2000 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a01.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2017. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The purpose of this experiment was to quantitatively examine the rapid colour changes associated with the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 and 05/06). \n\n65 randomly selected crabs were caught (21 males and 44 females) and their ability to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer. \n\nThe results indicate that when caught, or otherwise stressed, U. capricornis are capable of rapidly changing their colour, with short term colour changes more likely in females. In all cases the pattern remained unchanged, but did become more difficult to distinguish as the colours darkened.",

Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

The infrastructure consists of a base station mounted on the existing reef communications tower and a single buoy which carries the actual sensors.\n\nMyrmidon Reef is on the edge of the continetial shelf and so the station is designed to measure upwelling of water from the slope coming up and onto the continential shelf. The station is linked to stations at Rib Reef (mid-shelf) and Orpheus Island (inshore) to track upwelling water across the shelf.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The beef sectors of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have grown significantly over the past two decades. This report profiles the beef industries of these four beef exporting South American nations, as well as Australia, and evaluates the trends and key factors behind the growth in real export values since 2000. Forward looking scenario analysis based on actual and hypothetical changes to policies and operating environments is undertaken to assess the potential impacts on Australia's future beef exports. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n\r\n Global demand for beef is expected to expand significantly over the next several decades, especially in Asia, which will present opportunities for exporters. \r\n\r\n Australia and South America, together, account for almost half of world trade in beef. \r\n\r\n South America is emerging as a significant competitor for the Australian beef industry, as market access to Australia's traditional markets is improving. \r\n\r\n For the five beef exporting countries profiled in this report, improved market access was the main driver of real export revenue growth (in 2000 US dollar terms) between 2000 and 2014. Other contributing drivers include changes in export supply costs, exchange rate movements and growth in demand for beef. \r\n\r\n Three forward-looking scenarios assess the potential change to export growth from 2014 to 2030 from changes in domestic and international operating environments. These include: the removal of Argentine agricultural export requirements; improved market access for South American beef; and improvements in transport infrastructure for Brazil and Australia. \r\n\r\n To maintain its export competitiveness, Australia will need to: 1. improve productivity growth both on and off the farm \r\n2. continue to target premium markets and improve market access in order to be responsive to changes in the market \r\n3. maintain a production system that ensures its status as a clean and green beef producer so that it will be able to distinguish itself on quality when it cannot compete on price with lower-cost exporters. \r\n",

The Indigenous use and rights information was sourced from multiple Indigenous land ownership, land management and land rights datasets from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies. The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset. The dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR). The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are:\r\n1.\tIndigenous owned and managed;\r\n2.\tIndigenous managed;\r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and\r\n4.\tOther Special rights.\r\nThese categories align with the reporting requirements of the SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a N-S transect, running from Red Point in the north, to Creswell in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 9 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The three means for managing bushfire fuels are\nreduction, removal and conversion to a less flammable type, and are achieved by\nundertaking the slashing, grazing, physical removal, and/or prescribed burns\n\n\nThese activities are described in a yearly program of work\nreferred to as the <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/bushfire-management-plans\">Bushfire Operations Plan</a> (BOP), which sets out activities to meet the\nrequirements of the <a href=\"https://esa.act.gov.au/community-information/publications/sbmp/\">Strategic\nBushfire Management Plan for the ACT</a> (SBMP).

    "title": "Agricultural commodities: December quarter 2015",
    "description": "Overview \r\n The December edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities in 2015-16, and updates the outlook ABARES released in September 2015. \r\n\r\n In addition to commodity forecasts, this publication includes two boxes: \r\n• seasonal conditions in Australia \r\n• farm cash income of broadacre farms \r\n and one article: • key agricultural outcomes of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. \r\n\r\nFarmer/stakeholder implications \r\n The Agricultural commodities report provides high quality and timely information that supports higher farm gate returns through informed decision making by primary producers. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8 per cent in 2015-16 to around $57.6 billion, following an estimated increase of 4 per cent to $53.5 billion in 2014-15. At this forecast level, the gross value of farm production in 2015-16 would be around 17 per cent higher than the average of $49.4 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 13 per cent in 2015-16 to $30.0 billion following an estimated increase of 16 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects expected increases in the farmgate prices for beef cattle, lamb, sheep and wool. \r\n• The forecast increases in farmgate prices are expected to more than offset a forecast decline of 5 per cent in the volume index of livestock production in 2015-16. This mainly reflects an assumption of more favourable seasonal conditions in the latter half of 2015-16 leading to reduced slaughter as a result of herd and flock rebuilding. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 2 per cent in 2015-16 to $27.6 billion alongside an expected increase of 2 per cent in the volume index of crop production. This mainly reflects increases in horticultural production offsetting the falling world prices of grains and oilseeds. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $44.0 billion in 2015-16, following a rise of 6 per cent to an estimated $43.6 billion in 2014-15. At this level, export earnings from farm commodities in 2015-16 would be around 15 per cent higher than the average of $38.2 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• Agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2015-16 include: wheat (up 3 per cent to $5.7 billion), wool (9 per cent to $3.5 billion), wine (3 per cent to $2.1 billion), lamb (1 per cent to $1.7 billion), sugar (8 per cent to $1.4 billion), live feeder/slaughter cattle (16 per cent to $1.3 billion) and chickpeas (56 per cent to $0.6 billion). \r\n• These forecast increases are expected to be largely offset by forecast falls in export earnings from beef and veal (down 3 per cent to $8.6 billion), dairy (6 per cent to $2.3 billion), coarse grains (14 per cent to $2.3 billion), canola (8 per cent to $1.2 billion), cotton (21 per cent to $1.2 billion) and mutton (2 per cent to $0.8 billion). \r\n• Export earnings from fisheries products are forecast to increase by 17 per cent to around $1.7 billion in 2015-16, after increasing by an estimated 10 per cent to $1.4 billion in 2014-15. \r\n• The index of unit export returns for Australian farm exports is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2015-16, following an estimated rise of 6 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects the effect of the assumed lower value of the Australian dollar, especially against the US dollar. \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of beef and veal, wool, wine, lamb, live feeder/slaughter cattle, rock lobster, mutton and chickpeas are forecast to increase in 2015-16. In contrast, export prices of wheat, barley, sugar and dairy products are forecast to decline. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n• World economic growth is assumed to be 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.4 per cent in 2016. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2015-16, compared with 2.2 per cent in 2014-15. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average around US72 cents in 2015-16, 14 per cent lower than the average of US84 cents in 2014-15. \r\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nThis dataset shows the modelled regional connectivity links for generalist species (birds and small mammals). Based local corridor values based on least cost paths through a local links dataset (see Barrett and Love 2012) at 2012. Categories indicate quality of regional connectivity between larger high value habitat patches. \nDataset has been re-categorised from  the original raster data source to eliminate \"no value\" cells and converted to a vector.\nRegional Linkage Value: This layer is derived from a two-step process. The first process is a “join the dots” links analysis using 550,000 paths between point pairs selected at random. Points were grouped in high value woodland habitat patches only. This least cost pathway analysis was then run through the local links paths, that is regional links were preferentially routed along paths that did not have a canopy gap of &gt;100m. High values indicate that more paths were found, i.e. more important for regional connectivity between high value habitat patches.\nconnectivityLinkageValue:\nRepresents the categorisation of the \"accumulated least cost pathway\" value for each linkage between habitat patches.  Least cost pathway indicates the a combination of habitat suitability of nodes along the path, and a the barriers to migration along that pathway.\nThe ACT connectivity mapping was undertaken by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A full study report has been produced, and is entitled Fine Scale Modelling of Fauna Habitat and Connectivity Values in the ACT Region. This study built upon an earlier report entitled the Ecological Connectivity for Climate Change in the ACT and surrounding region, commissioned by the ACT Government as part of Weathering the Change Action Plan 1. The report was undertaken by the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University (Manning et al 2010). It is recommended that both reports be consulted when use is being made of the connectivity mapping available. Reports can be downloaded from the EPSDD website at https://www.act.gov.au/environment/research-and-data/conservation-research-and-technical-reports (Technical reports 21 and 27).\nUpdates: This dataset is static. \nFit for purpose: 2012 temporal coverage. This dataset should be used as a modelled tool for aiding landuse, strategic town planning, and conservation planning in the ACT including revegetation targets and informing environmental impacts of infrastructure and building projects. Cell size 15x15m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n1.

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations.The highest species abundance of foraminifera in core MD032607 was recorded by Globigerina bulloides (~45%) during the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6) and, generally, was the most abundant with an average abundance of 19.5%. The dominance of the sub-polar, transitional species, Ga. bulloides in this core suggests the influence of cold, nutrient-rich water during certain isotopic stages. Conversely, the dominant warm and oligotrophic species Globigerinoides ruber recorded its lowest abundance in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, and is totally removed from the record (0%) at 146K, 142K, and 139K yrs BP.",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2023 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2023 AIS data. This report - the 11th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",
