Todd 1 mile military sheets and portions of the Marrakai, Mt. Tolmer, Batchelor, Tumbling Waters, Goodparla North, Goodparla South and Mt. Evelyn sheets. Detailed geological and geophysical reports and plans have also been prepared for all known radioactive mineral prospects, costeaning and diamond drilling has been undertaken to test some of the prospects and inspectional reports have been made on practically all airborne scintillometer anomalies located during surveys in 1952, and on some of those found during 1953. Prospecting operations have also been undertaken. A summary of the activities of the Bureau during 1953 and the results achieved is given in the following pages, and further details can be obtained from reports mentioned in the list of references.",

The Registers of demands document claims made for leases to pastoral runs in the various Pastoral Districts of Queensland from mainly during the 1850s and 1860s.\nInformation recorded includes gazettal number for the Lease (in lieu of a Lease number); names of Claimants, Transferees and Lessees, Name of Property (Run), notes on rents, lease renewals, re-tenders, forfeitures, and resumptions into reserves (e.g. Railway reserves).\nDating across the registers in inconsistent. Date/Year recorded in the index is derived from the date published in the gazette or date of lease or date notified depending on which date was recorded; some dates are estimated from the remarks column in lieu of any other information recorded or from the letter references for Lessees and Transferees e.g. 1850 is derived from letter reference 50/3559. The Index dates reflect the first date of the Lease or Gazettal publication; subsequent dates for transfers of leases have not been included.\nAccepted tenders for Runs in the Colony of Queensland were published in the gazettes and newspapers of the era which can be searched through TROVE.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

This voyage was staffed by only one GSM team member, thus 24 hours acquisition was not possible and there may be gaps in the data record.\n\nThe Kongsberg EM712 multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry and backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter transiting between the Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) mooring site and South Tasman Rise.\n\nThe EM712 provides a 0.5° by 1° transmit and receive angular resolution respectively. The echosounder's nominal frequency range is from 40 to 100 kHz. \n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. \n\nThere are 25 files totalling 4.16 GB of raw data and 25 files totalling 24.5 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of family violence patients retrieved from the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD), which holds information detailing presentations at Victorian public hospitals with designated Emergency Departments. The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of patients per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of patients recorded in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: VEMD Patient Rate = (Number of Patients/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nFor the financial years from July 2013 to June 2016, patients presenting for family violence reasons were identified with the human intent injuries of 'Maltreatment, assault by domestic partner' or 'Child neglect/maltreatment by parent or guardian'.\n\n\nFor the financial year 2016-2017 and onwards, the human intent data item changed, and patients presenting for family violence reasons are identified using the following categories: sexual assault by current or former intimate partner; sexual assault by other family member (excluding intimate partner); neglect, maltreatment, assault by current or former intimate partner or; neglect, maltreatment, assault by other family member (excluding intimate partner).\n\n\nDue to methodological improvements made to the calculation of financial year, numbers for some historical years have changed slightly from what was reported in the June 2017 publication of the Family Violence Database.\n\n",

    "description": "The wetlands component of the Interim Classification of Aquatic Ecosystems is a compilation of wetland polygon mapping for the Murray-Darling Basin using the best available mapping from state jurisdictions (South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales), Australian Government agencies and other organisations.  Data sources range in scale from 1:25,000 to 1:250,000. The interim Australian National Aquatic Ecosystem (ANAE) classification framework has been applied to all wetland polygons varying by system type (lacustrine, palustrine, riverine, estuarine and springs). Floodplains are classified in a separate layer. Attribute values and final wetland types are included in the attribute data table.\nThis dataset was previously split by systemtype into four separate datasets, but has been re-amalagamated into a single dataset.This data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence. More information can be found at http://www.ausgoal.gov.au/creative-commons.\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2015\nLicenced for use under Creative Commons Australia Attribution\nVictoria\nVictoria maintains an inventory of wetlands (WETLAND_CURRENT) which is designed for use in Victorian wetland projects and is subject to ongoing validation and updates. WETLAND_CURRENT can be obtained from the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (see http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/forestry-and-land-use/maps-imagery-and-data\nfor further details). For lacustrine and palustrine aquatic ecosystems, the MDB_ANAE geodatabase is more suited to wetland projects involving other jurisdictions. While much of the data for lacustrine and palustrine wetlands was sourced from WETLAND_CURRENT, there may be some inconsistencies between MDB_ANAE geodatabase and WETLAND_CURRENT. The two datasets can be linked through the AltSrcID (MDB_ANAE geodatabase) and Wetland_No (WETLAND_CURRENT data set) fields.\nSA\nDue to the Basin-wide nature of this dataset, accuracy of final classes has not been ground truthed comprehensively, which could impact results of any analysis using this data. Therefore it is imperative that this dataset is assessed as to fitness for use in any application and decisions made about further levels of validation required. Significant care should be taken if information derived from this dataset is to guide decision making, form binding agreements regarding target setting, compliance of any form, or monitoring of achievements, this includes for the purpose of summarising areas of wetland types.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2016 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "Horticulture farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated citrus, pome and stone fruit growing farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies, with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin accounts for about three-quarters of Australia's citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit production with a large percentage of these crops grown in the southern Basin. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash income for citrus farms increased to around $90 000 in 2013-14 and then declined to around $72 000 in 2014-15. Pome fruit and stone fruit growers achieved average farm cash incomes of around $108 000 and $75 000 in 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15 the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) was 0.4 per cent for citrus growers and 0.7 per cent for pome and stone fruit growers. \r\n\r\n An increasing proportion of citrus farms used drip/trickle systems and fewer farms used low-throw sprinklers. Other irrigation systems used by citrus growers included micro sprays, overhead sprinklers and flood/furrow irrigation. Low-throw sprinklers and drip/trickle irrigation were also the most commonly used systems on stone fruit farms. Pome fruit was irrigated using a range of systems, with the most popular systems being low-throw sprinklers, micro sprays and drip/trickle irrigation. \r\n\r\n Few citrus growers traded water from 2010-11 to 2012-13, but around 54 per cent were net sellers of water in 2013-14. Most pome and stone fruit growers were non-traders in all years except 2007-08 and 2013-14. ",

    "description": "This instrument has been designed in the Radiometric Laboratory of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, t o meet the needs of those uranium prospectors who wish to build Geiger counters. The circuit has been designed so that it can be adjusted with a minimum of test equipment. Indication of the count rate is provided by a ratemeter with three ranges; 0-200, 0-1,000 and 0-10,000 counts per minute. Earphones also provide an audible indication of the count rate. The following rate describes the operation of the circuit and the procedure to be adopted to adjust the voltage at various points in the circuit for correct operation. A schematic circuit diagram is also provided and several points concerned with the mechanical design of the instrument are mentioned.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for August 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars.\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only locational data are reported in this statistical table and all assets are reported at market value.  \r\n\r\nData are shown for a range of countries and regions. Similar data for a selected group of countries are also available in B12.1.\r\n\r\nCountry and regional groupings are based on the classification used in the IBS.\r\n\r\nThis statistical table contains seven data worksheets. Six present data for countries within each specified region, while the 'Summary' worksheet shows total international assets of Australian-located banks (and RFCs between March 2003 and September 2010) for each region, and Australia. In each of these worksheets, the data in the last column measures total international assets for the region. Total international assets for each country add to total international assets for the region. However, in some quarters, this cannot be directly verified because data for individual countries and regions have blank entries in order to avoid disclosing confidential bank exposures.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Summary' worksheet, the positions by region are summed to produce a ‘Total non-residents’ figure that represents reporting entities’ total positions with offshore counterparties in all currencies. The positions shown for 'Australia' are positions with residents in foreign currency.\r\n",

In addition to the data files, graphed data and plots of mooring position are available.\n\nMoored instruments are deployed by the IMOS Australian Bluewater Observing System (ABOS) Southern Ocean Time Series sub-facility for time-series observations of physical, biological, and chemical properties, in the Sub-Antarctic Zone southwest of Tasmania, with twice-yearly servicing. \n\nThe Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) Sub-Facility \nis responsible for the deployment of Pulse moorings.\n\nThese time-series observations are crucial to resolving ecosystem processes that affect carbon cycling, ocean productivity and marine responses to climate variability and change, ocean acidification and other stresses.",

    "description": "The Murray-Darling Basin Plan (available at http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012L02240) was developed under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007 and aims to deliver a coordinated approach to water use by States and Territories in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), underpinned by a commitment to restoring the long-term health of rivers and wetlands in the Basin. To achieve this, the Basin Plan sets a long term average Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) for surface water and groundwater use across the major valleys in the MDB, and incorporates an Environmental Watering Plan (EWP) that ensures surplus water beyond SDLs is made available for the natural floodplain and wetland systems. The EWP is central to the Basin Plan as it aims to achieve the best possible environmental outcomes in its use of environmental water, in terms of size, timing and nature of river flows. The EWP is supported by the Environmental Water Recovery Strategy, a voluntary water buyback instrument (SEWPAC 2012).\nThe long term average SDL for surface water flow is currently set by the Basin Plan at 10,873 gigalitres per year (GL/y). This includes 3,468 GL/y for the northern Basin, which establishes a water ‘saving’ of 390 GL/y from water allocations previously set under the Living Murray initiative (MDBA 2011). These savings are available as ‘environmental water’ which is regulated by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO) via the EWP.\nWater allocations in the northern Basin are currently under review via the Northern Basin Review, which is due for finalisation in mid-2016. This review is expected to improve environmental science in relation to floodplain systems in the Condamine-Balonne and Barwon-Darling River systems, and may recommend changes to the Basin Plan accordingly. A key part of the Review is to improve knowledge about environmental assets within river systems of the northern Basin (e.g. floodplain and wetland vegetation, fish, water birds), and how they respond and interact to fluctuations in surface water flow. Improved knowledge about the native vegetation of inland floodplain systems is fundamental to the Northern Basin Review.\nTo improve information about the distribution and extent of floodplain and wetland vegetation types in the northern Basin, Eco Logical Australia (ELA) was commissioned by the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to map the distribution of plant community types (PCTs) within a large section of the Darling floodplain west of Louth, and within the Condamine-Balonne system south of the NSW-Queensland border. An improved knowledge about the distribution and extent of floodplain PCTs will inform how environmental water allocations might be refined, and is thus an important component of the Northern Basin Review.\nFor more information please refer to the technical report Eco Logical Australia 2015. Vegetation of the Barwon-Darling and Condamine-Balonne floodplain systems of New South Wales: Mapping and survey of plant community types. Prepared for Murray-Darling Basin Authority. \nAttributes: \nPCT_ID = NSW Plant Community Type Code \nPCT_LABEL = Plant Community Type Label \nBROAD_VEG = Broad Vegetation Type \nHYDROL_ECOL = Hydro-Ecological Functional Group \nVEG_FORMAT = Vegetation Formation \nVEG_CLASS = Vegetation Class \nFloodplain = Floodplain vegetation (yes or no) \nMAP_LABEL = Short vegetation label suitable for display on map products \nRE = Regional Ecosystem Code RE_LABEL = Regional Ecosystem Label ACCURACY = Attribute accuracy (values 1 to 5) \n5 - Verified in the field by either full floristic, rapid or API (observational) site \n4 - Not verified in the field but likely to be correct due to extrapolation from similar verified pattern or verified in field but uncertain of boundary \n3 - Probably correct although could be one of a few related communities \n2 - Possibly correct but might be one of several other communities \n1 - Unlikely to be correct\nVIS_ID 4454",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This study was nested in sub-project 3.2.2 “Ecosystem impacts of human usage and the effectiveness of zoning for the biodiversity conservation” in Node 3.2. The focus of this study was on trophic effects in the NMP. Due to the importance of herbivores in coral-reef systems, this study focused on characterising and quantifying the process of herbivory in the NMP with a particular emphasis on the removal of adult macroalgae.\n\nWe used a range of approaches to gain an understanding of spatial and species-related patterns in herbivory in five distinct studies. Using underwater video cameras and Sargassum myriocystum assays, 23 different fish species were observed consuming macroalgae, but seven species (Naso unicornis, Kyphosus sp., K. vaigiensis, Siganus doliatus, Scarus ghobban, S. schlegeli and initial-phase Scarus sp.) together accounted for 95% of the observed bites across five regions. Of these species, three were identified as the most important in consuming macroalgae: N. unicornis, Kyphosus sp. and K. vaigiensis. These results were supported by stable isotope analyses that incorporate nutrients from food sources over far longer periods than those examined using the assay approach.\n\nThe attached final report provides details on the 5 studies conducted related to herbivory:\n\n1.     Spatial patterns in herbivory on a coral reef are influenced by structural complexity but not by algal traits.\n2.     Herbivore diversity on coral reefs: a transcontinental comparison. \n3.\tVariation in macroalgal herbivory by fishes across a western-continental coral-reef system. \n4.\tVariability in the food sources of herbivorous invertebrates and fishes in a coral-reef system: a stable isotope approach. \n5.\tThe role of herbivory on the spatial distribution of recruiting and established algal communities in coral versus algal dominated habitats.",

    "title": "The fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi uses colour vision in mate choice",
    "description": "The walking legs, carapaces and chelae of ocypodid crabs, particularly the well-studied fiddler crabs, are often brilliantly coloured. However, despite this array of colours there is still some debate over whether ocypodid crabs are actually capable of colour vision and what role it might play.\n\nThe aim of this experiment was to test the colour vision capabilities of fiddler crabs in a biologically significant context. To determine whether Uca mjoebergi use differences in spectral composition to discriminate between colours, and thus possess colour vision, I tested their ability to consistently discriminate yellow from various shades of grey. Experiments were conducted in October 2005 on an intertidal mudflat in the East Point Reserve, Darwin.\n\nWhen the crabs were reproductively active, during neap tide, wandering females were caught and placed under a container 15 cm from two identical plaster casts of a U. mjoebergi male's 21.8 mm claw. Females were given a choice between a yellow claw (Dulux Tiny Tin yellow enamel) and a claw painted white, 75% grey, 50% grey, 25% grey or black (made by mixing appropriate amounts of white and black Dulux Tiny Tin enamel paint). It was recorded which claw the female approached within 2 cm. Each combination was tested until 15 females successfully made a choice. \n\nThe same experiment was conducted with two tethered, size matched (within 1 mm claw length), and handedness-matched males in place of the plaster claws. The males were tethered with 1 cm of cotton super-glued to their carapace and tied to a nail stuck in the ground, allowing some restricted movement. I painted the males' claw either with the same yellow paint as above or with the light yellow paint, made by mixing one part yellow to 14 parts white paint. The experiment was repeated 25 times using different pairs of males and new females each time.",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "title": "Southern Surveyor Voyage SS 05/2007 - Voyage of discovery - benthic biodiversity of the deep continental shelf and slope in Australia's \"North West Region\"",
    "description": "The overall aims were to provide data on the distribution of deep seabed habitats and fauna that are amenable to scientific hypothesis testing, can be immediately applied to marine resource management processes, and that enable strategic development of tools and techniques for understanding the processes that maintain deep sea biodiversity. This work was to support the process of NWR Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories, distribution maps and conservation values. Data will be collected at scientific reference sites from potential MPA areas that can be re-visited for monitoring purposes in the future. Sampling along environmental gradients (geographic range and depth) in this section of Australia's coast will also provide the opportunity to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses. Further refinement of predictive methods for identifying seabed habitat types, initially developed in temperate and cool-temperate environments, will be enabled by data collection from this tropical location in Australia. We intended to highlight the importance of this underlying science as a modern \"Voyage of Discovery\" given the likely significance of the findings in terms of Australia's biodiversity and its biogeography and evolution. (From Voyage Plan)\nThis record describes the biological samples taken during the survey. Fishes were lodges in the CSIRO Fish collection, invertebrate specimens were photographed and distributed to Australian museums for identification by taxonomists, focusing on sponges, corals, echinoderms, ascidians, molluscs and crustaceans. To date (as per Dec 2016) we are aware of 27 manuscripts of taxonomic revisions and/or descriptions that have used material collected from this survey.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who did not see or delayed seeing a dentist, hygienist or dental specialist due to cost in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in March 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R4.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, March 02, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, March 07, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

SA4 group relates to a predefined geographical area, based on population and labour markets, whereas remoteness is based on density of population.\n\n\nFrom 2016 onwards, geographical data is reported by the ABS remoteness structure. The ABS remoteness structure uses 5 categories: Major Cities, Inner Regional, Outer Regional, Remote and Very Remote. Prior to 2016, MCEECDYA categories were used, which divided schools into four categories.\n\n\nSince 2014, the department has used a geographical structure based on the new ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Groups of ASGS Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries in NSW have been combined into 11 groups for reporting and publication of department data. Previous publications compared enrolments in DEC regions. Further information on SA4 groups is available in the Statistical Bulletin Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

The reports summarise the performance of these fisheries against the requirements of fisheries legislation and policy. \r\n\r\n The fisheries assessed in the Fishery status reports 2016 generated an estimated gross value of production of $348 million in 2014-15, which is about 13 per cent of Australia's total fisheries and aquaculture gross value of production of $2.6 billion. \r\n\r\n The  Fishery status reports  form part of a suite of ABARES publications that aim to provide a comprehensive and multidimensional account of the trends and outlook for Australian fisheries. The  Australian fisheries statistics  reports provide annual updates of fisheries production and trade data.

    "description": "This data set provides mobile (cellular) network performance, allocated to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) boundaries from the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).\nAdditional columns have been added corresponding to the matching boundaries of the 2016 ABS Statistical Area Levels 2, 3 and 4, and the 2020 Local Government Areas. These were spatially joined using the centroid of each polygon, and therefore, should only be used as an approximation. Furthermore, grid cells residing outside of these boundaries, such as offshore or over rivers, are assigned a null value in these columns.",

The size data collected during these experiments (531 male-female neighbours : 215 male-male neighbours) is the basis of this dataset. \n\nFemale size was found to be positively correlated with the size of her nearest male neighbour.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from the transect running across the mouth of Jervis Bay, running from Point Perpendicular in the north, to Bowen Island in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~5 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nFor each day of sampling two resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station. For a number of sampling days a third resource is offered, providing vertically averaged CTD data over 4m depth bins.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This dataset includes City of Melbourne’s mapping of greening potential in laneways across the municipality. 'Greening' in this dataset refers to four types of possible greening responses: forest lanes, farm lanes, park lanes and vertical gardens. Higher gridcodes indicate lower potential for adaptation - i.e. a gridcode of 1 is optimal.\n\n\nThis dataset can be used the general public, developers, landscape architects and other interested parties who want to know what the future of green laneways may look like for Melbourne. This dataset can be used as a starting point for greening projects including forest, farm and park lanes as well as vertical gardens\n\n\nAnyone interested in potential greening within the city should contact the City of Melbourne or visit the Green Infrastructure webpages found on the  City of Melboune website here. The Growing Green Guide is another helpful and comprehensive guide for the building and maintaining green roofs, walls and facades in Melbourne and Victoria.\n\n\nThe Laneways with greening potential dataset is part of a larger suite of work by City of Melbourne to explore and implement contemporary and unique ways of greening in the city that can help combat increased urban density and loss of public open space. Green laneways are an exciting way to liven up the city, and help residents and visitors to explore Melbourne while also combating increasing threats of stormwater runoff, the urban heat island and biodiversity loss.",

    "description": "The Port Fairy Local Coastal Hazard Assessment (LCHA) provides information on the extent of coastal hazards and their physical impacts for the Port Fairy coastal environment.\n\nThis data considers setback of the present day shoreline due to coastal erosion if existing seawall (where present) remains in place. The four key components of coastal setback that are incorporated into this hazard line are: \n- S1, allowance for short term storm erosion (storm demand 100 year ARI); \n- S2, allowance for dune stability (zone of reduced foundation capacity); \n- S3, allowance for ongoing underlying recession; and, \n- S4, allowance for recession due to future sea level rise. \n\nThe total design setback (S) for three planning horizons comprises:\n- Present day: S = S1 + S2;\n- 2050: S = S1 + S2 + S3(2050) + S4(2050);\n- 2080: S = S1 + S2 + S3(2080) + S4(2080); and\n- 2100: S = S1 + S2 + S3(2100) + S4(2100).\n\nSea level rise projections utilised for the planning horizons were 0.4 m for 2050, 0.8 m for 2080 and 1.2 m for 2100 respectively. Where appropriate, the +6 m AHD contour was used as a reference as it was considered to represent the coastal alignment reasonably. The crest of the rock revetment was used as the reference contour on the southern half of East Beach. For low-lying dune systems the +2 m AHD contour was used.\n\nDetails of the assumptions made in the derivation of this information can be found in project reports on the Our Coast website: http://www.ourcoast.org.au/cb_pages/resources.php.\nUsers of this information should read these project reports to understand the limitations of the data.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2006.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "The flood study carried out for the Griffith CBD catchment identifies flood liable properties for a range of design floods and finds approximately 168 properties that are flood liable during the 1% AEP event. \nThe Griffith CBD and upstream areas have experienced flooding in the past. This has been attributed to the insufficient capacity of the existing pipe drainage system, the flat topography across much of the area and the impediment to overland flow paths posed by the Main Branch Canal and the Temora-Roto Railway Line that passes to the immediate north of the CBD. In recognition of these flood issues, Griffith City Council (Council) have appointed WMAwater to carry out an Overland Flow Flood Study for the Griffith CBD catchment under the guidance of Council’s Floodplain Risk Management Committee.\nThe main objective of this study is to:\n\nDefine the overland flow flood behaviour within the Griffith CBD catchment over the full range of design flood events;\nDetail the number of properties at flood risk, extent of flood damage, and  provide Council with the technical basis to prepare a Floodplain Risk  Management Study &amp;  Plan;\nPrepare a modelling system suitable for use in the Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan, for assessing flood mitigation works; and\nProvide Council with a modelling tool for the pit and pipe drainage system.\n\nThe study has established suitable hydrologic and hydraulic modelling tools, demonstrated their capacity to emulate local flood behaviour via calibration/validation (as data allows) and then applied these tools to establish the existing flood risk for a range of design flood event probabilities in conjunction with a range of event durations.\nThis study has assessed major overland flow flooding throughout the Griffith CBD catchment in general and in the commercial areas in particular, providing Council with a sound understanding of the full range of potential flood risks and enabling Council to determine an optimum mix of works and measures to manage these risks.",

    "description": "This data was collected in November 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T04.\n\nDeparted: \tFremantle, WA,   Nov 10, 2011\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS,   Nov 20, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This key layer is the index to the input datasets collated into the estimated Pre-1750 (pre-clearing, pre-European) theme of the NVIS Version 5.1 dataset (from which the NVIS Major Vegetation Groups and Subgroups were derived).\n\nThe layer is intended to document and describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS Pre-1750 theme dataset. Important information in the spatial feature class includes the dataset spatial extent (i.e. its \"footprint\"), dataset number and the source of the underlying dataset. Where more than one dataset have been combined within a region (mainly NSW & NT), a complex of footprints is the result.\n\nA lookup table provides important information, such as dataset title, scale and the on-ground range of dates of the vegetation survey. Attributes in the lookup table NVIS5_1_LUT_KEY_DSETn (from the NVIS DATASET and VERSION_USAGE Oracle tables, where n = an incremental number for minor version updates) need to be attached to this spatial data via DATA_SET_NUMBER. See metadata for this LUT for more details.This data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

This assumes no change in vegetation type - just whether the type remains (i.e. hasn't been cleared). \n\nNo vector estimated pre-1750 layers are available for NSW and Tasmania. However, estimated pre-1750 layers have been developed under the Major Vegetation Group and Major Vegetation Subgroup products, using the same logic as above.\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018",

The noise filtered classification is the final product derived using SPOT 4/5 satellite imagery with Landsat 5 imagery used on small areas where cloud or where SPOT imagery coverage was unavailable. . The five of the eight classes have been labeled based on severity classes provided with the ground survey data. The remaining classes account for vegetation structures with no specific burn severity assigned. The area covered by the classification is approximately 460 by 300 km and is clipped to the extents of the fire effected lands (approximately 400 000 hectares).",

    "description": "This dataset contains a consolidated view of Official Utilisation figures across all transport modes (train, metro, bus, ferry and light rail). Opal daily tap-on/tap-off data is aggregated to a total monthly figure representing the estimated number of trips across all transport modes.\nStarting July 1, 2024, the methodology for calculating trip numbers for individual lines and operators will change to more accurately reflect the services our passengers use within the transport network. This new approach will apply to trains, metros, light rail, and ferries, and will soon be extended to buses. Aggregations between line, agency, and mode levels will no longer be valid, as a passenger may use multiple lines on a single trip. Trip numbers at the line, operator, or mode level should be used as reported, without further combinations.\nThe dataset includes reports based on both the new and old methodologies, with a transition to the new method taking place over the coming months. As a result of this change, caution should be exercised when analysing longer trends that utilise both datasets.           More information on NRT ROAM can be accessed\nhere",

Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\r\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\r\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\r\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment Designated irrigation\r\nareas indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\r\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\r\nThe precise meaning of the term designated irrigation area varies from\r\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\r\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\r\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\r\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\r\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\r\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\r\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\r\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\r\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\r\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\r\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\r\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\r\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\r\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\r\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\r\nsource material is highly variable and completness of coverage is poor in\r\nsome regions.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\r\n__00211a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\nLineage: The data set was constructed in vector format by appending irrigation area boundary data sets supplied by various agencies. The component data sets are listed below. One of the component data sets which was supplied as separate tiles in ArcView shapefile format was assembled into a single shapefile data set in ArcView 3.1. All other processing was carried out in ARC/INFO 7.2.1 under SunOS using double precision coordinates. For all operations in which processing used a fuzzy tolerance, the value specified was 0.00001 degrees (about 1 m). The raster form of the data set was made from the vector form. 1) Ord River Scheme, Stage 1, irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by Agriculture WA in ArcView shapefile format.2) Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland. This data set was supplied by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows designated irrigation areas. The coordinate datum is not known with certainty and was assumed to be the Australian Geodetic Datum 1984.3) Northern Murray-Darling Basin irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows actual irrigation areas, based on interpretation of coarse scale imagery derived from Landsat TM images. The data set comprises 11 polygons. Of these, five have not been retained in the national data set because they largely coincide with the much higher resolution polygons of the Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. A sixth has not been retained because it proves to be almost entirely covered by a national park and a perennial lake. One of the polygons that was retained was edited to give precedence to a higher resolution polygon in the Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland data set which it partly overlies.4) Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. This data set was supplied by the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, in ArcView shapefile format, as 50 separate tiles. It shows actual irrigation areas and a variety of other land uses and land covers related to cotton growing. It is based on interpretation of aerial photography and satellite imagery with extensive field checking. Only the polygons showing irrigation areas were included in the national data set. The tiles were merged in ArcView using the merge function of the GeoProcessing Wizard. Further processing was undertaken in AR\r\n\r\n",

The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. The core obtained offshore from Sumatra (BAR9043, 104.0316E, 5.82S) highlights an upwelling signal at 14,000 yrs BP that disrupts the warm stratified water column, which was a feature between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to present. This upwelling is timed to a regional pattern of an intensified Australasian Monsoon.",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe fifth of these six experiments involved the winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), moored in the central part of Jervis Bay (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed.\n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There is only one subsiduary records that directly relates to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \nfef1f3c0-6d9f-11dd-8128-00188b4c0af8",

    "title": "Kelso Stormwater Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is largely located within the Sydney suburb of Panania. The study area\nincludes the entire Kelso Creek catchment, from the stormwater pipe network in the upper\ncatchment to Kelso Creek, which flows through Kelso Park and eventually joins the Georges\nRiver. The lower catchment is provided some protection against flooding from the Georges\nRiver through the Kelso levee. The catchment is wholly within the Bankstown local\ngovernment area.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for some 850 stormwater pits\nand 810 stormwater drainage pipelines. Photos of culverts and other sketches are also\nlinked to the database.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. All pipes, drains and\ncreeks are included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\n\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

The power station is part of the Wayatinah \"A\" project. The object of the survey was to determine the thickness of the alluvial gravel formation on the river flat, the weathered section of the sandstone and the dolerite, and to indicate the presence of shear zones. Three traverses parallel to the proposed penstock line, and 100 feet apart, and three cross traverses were surveyed in January and February, 1954. After completion of the original survey two additional traverses were surveyed on the location chosen for the power station, penstock lines and tail race site.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in December 2008, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton (not bacteria and viruses this cruise).\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions. Various sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "description": "The Department measures progress of children and young people as they move from early childhood into their school years, and then into further education and work through the four objectives across this life cycle: achievement, engagement, wellbeing and productivity.\nOn Victorian Student Satisfaction Survey (multiple years), the survey is of students who completed or left training in the previous year. Results have been rearranged to refer to the year of the Survey. Therefore, the 2021 result (latest available) in this dataset is of student training experiences in 2020, based on the 2021 Satisfaction Survey. Due to 2 changes in the survey methodology, the results for this measure cannot be compared over time. In the 2018 Survey (of 2017 experiences), respondents were given an extra response option in one of the relevant questions. In the 2020 Survey (of 2019 experiences), a further change was made to the job-related benefits question to reduce complexity and confusion.\nOn the Engagement Indicators tab, note that for \"Students with a positive opinion about their school providing a stimulating learning environment\", in 2020–21, the results were reported against the wrong year levels (Years 7–10 and Years 11–12, instead of Year 7-9 and Years 10-12). This has been corrected in this Annual Report.\nOn the Wellbeing Indicators tab, note that for \"Students feeling connected to their school\", in 2020–21, the results were reported against the wrong year levels (Years 7–10 and Years 11–12, instead of Year 7-9 and Years 10-12). This has been corrected in this Annual Report.\nAnnual Report published: https://www.vic.gov.au/department-education-annual-reports",

The first is to understand pulsars: how do they spin down and what disrupts this process, how and why their profiles vary with time, whether they precess or have planetary mass companions, in short all the things that make pulsar timing noisier than the perfect clock. Secondly we want to understand the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through repeated monitoring of dispersion measure, rotation measure and flux density variations in conjunction with scintillation parameters. Finally, we provide these data as a community service both to the high-energy community where we have strong collaborative links (particularly to Fermi) and to the radio pulsar astronomers generally through the CSIRO archive. The project is on-going since 2007, we are (co-)authors on 106 papers arising from the P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of students from Bordeaux, Manchester, Oxford, Stanford, and Swinburne. We are seeking long-term project status with a view to continuing the project into the SKA era.",

    "title": "Camera Trap Images from Robson Creek Rainforest SuperSite",
    "description": "High quality passive infrared wildlife cameras were used to acquire information on faunal biodiversity at the Robson Creek site. \nTwo camera traps were deployed at the site between 17-03-2018 and 25-07-2018. The first camera located in proximity to the acoustic sensor SM2/SM4 which is around 100m from the flux tower and at a height of 1.5 meter above ground, on a star picket. The second camera located for a short while near the tower (10 meter) and was attached on a bungy cord tied to a tree, at a height of 0.3 meter above ground.\n\nThe Robson Creek site lies on the Atherton Tablelands in the wet tropical rain forests of Australia at 680-740 m elevation. It is situated in Danbulla National Park within the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. The Wet Tropics Bioregion of Australia is situated on the north-eastern coast of Queensland, between Cooktown to the north and Townsville to the south. Approximately 40% (7200 km2) of the region is covered by rain forest. Features of the region include very high plant and animal endemism, characteristics of both Gondwanan and Indo-Malaysian forests, and frequent cyclonic disturbance. The site includes core 1 ha plot (100 m x 100 m) which is located within the fetch of the flux tower and is the focal site of recurrent monitoring, and 25 ha vegetation survey plot. The vegetation survey plot has been set up for inclusion in the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s Center for Tropical Forest Science – Forest Global Earth Observatory (CTFS-ForestGEO) global network of forest research plots. \n\nFor additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/robson-creek-rainforest-supersite/ .  Other images collected at the site include time-lapse images taken from 3 phenocams (above canopy).   Camera trap results for the TERN FNQ Rainforest SuperSite - Robson Creek, Jan - Feb 2017.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and attended an antenatal visit in the first trimester (less than 14 weeks), by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers for whom gestation at first antenatal visit was 'Not stated' and mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

Aurora Australis collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 30 minutes. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 1-minute averages of the observations are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of environmental observations as well as ship parameters (such as speed and direction). Wind is observed with two different sensors, and the relative (observed) and true (relative to fixed earth) wind speed and direction provided. Air temperature and humidity is observed on the port and starboard of the main mast. Short-wave (sunlight) and long-wave (infra-red radiation or heat, from sky and clouds) is also observed on the port and starboard side. Precipitation is observed with an optical rain-gauge and traditional siphon gauge from the foremast.  Instrument meta-data and QC flags are also contained in the files.",

Please refer to the Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics available at: \nhttps://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-region-schemes-2024-remnant-vegetation-statistics\nThe Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics provide status of remnant vegetation for the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion, the Metropolitan, Peel and portion of the Greater Bunbury Region Scheme areas, and local government areas within these regions.\nOverview of the Report:\nFrom 2007 to 2018 DBCA provided regular updates of statistics on the pre-European and current extent of the vegetation associations of Western Australia within IBRA or IBRA sub-regions. The reporting is based on Beards (pre-European) vegetation mapping of systems and associations at 1:250,000. The statistics were used for several purposes including conservation planning, land use planning and when assessing development applications.\nThe statistics provided a general overview of the status of vegetation associations, within IBRA bioregions or sub-regions, noting the limitations detailed in the README document relating to scale, remnant vegetation mapping and currency of the analysis. They were intended to be used in conjunction with other information on the biodiversity values of an area and with input and advice from people familiar with the vegetation association and the vegetation condition of an area of interest.\nIncluded in the report are statistics on the progress towards achieving a conservation reserve system, for WA, that is comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR). The CAR reserve system is based on three principles:\n· Comprehensive - includes the full range of ecological/forest communities recognised at an appropriate scale within and across each bioregion,\n· Adequate – level (extent) of reservation that will ensure viability and integrity of populations, species, and ecological communities, and\n· Representative – those areas reserved should reasonably reflect the biotic diversity of the communities\nThe system of reserves helps conserve our biodiversity. Please contact DBCA for advice on the CAR statistics.\nIn 2011 the name of the report changed from \"CAR Analysis\" to \"Statewide Vegetation Statistics\". The CAR analysis statistics are still included in the report.",

    "description": "The prevalence of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in and around the Galactic center and the bulge has been one of the key questions in pulsar astronomy. In addition to finding more exotic and interesting binary systems at and around the Galactic center and bulge due to the enhanced density of stars/stellar remnants, MSPs are also proposed to be one of the candidates to explain the observed Fermi gamma-ray excess. However, most of the MSPs discovered so far are field (disk) MSPs or those in globular clusters. Initial steps towards addressing the question of Galactic center/bulge MSPs were made with the discovery of the first MSPs in a Galactic filament, but more progress comes from the discovery of a sample of MSPs around the Galactic center. Blind surveys targeting MSPs can suffer from many observational biases that smear the pulses due to binary acceleration, scattering from the enhanced density, and so on, which increases the parameter space for discovery and can sometimes make the problem intractable. However, if pulsar candidates can be identified reliably from imaging surveys, then targeted observations can make the problem tractable in identifying the pulsations. We followed up a sample of polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT bulge imaging survey and discovered a sample of 16 new MSPs. Here we request the timing observations of 8 interesting MSPs (a subset of our discovery sample), to study the binary nature of these sources and their potential inclusion in pulsar timing array efforts.",

    "description": "The study area includes that portion of Terrys Creek within the City of Ryde from Terry\nRoad to the creek’s confluence with the Lane Cove River. In addition, as shown in\nFigure 1, it includes all significant tributaries of Terrys Creek.\n\nThis report provides a description of the establishment and calibration of a computer\nmodel of flood behaviour throughout the study area. This model will become the\nprimary tool for assessing both the existing flood behaviour and the changes which may\noccur through the implementation of any flood mitigation options that may be proposed\nduring the course of the study.\n\nCatchment Areas\n\nFor the purposes of Council’s management of the stormwater systems within the City of\nRyde, the Terrys Creek catchment has been traditionally divided into the Eastwood and\nTerrys Creek drainage subcatchments.\n\nThe Ryde component of the Eastwood subcatchment is about 169 hectares in area and\nextends from the intersection of Marsden Road and Terry Road to Blaxland Rd,\nEastwood. The Terrys Creek subcatchment comprises an area of about 326 hectares\nand extends from the intersection of Blaxland Road and Kings Road to the Lane Cove\nRiver.\n\nThe upstream portion of Terrys Creek (within Parramatta City Council) has an\nestimated area of 160 hectares, while the remaining portion of the catchment (within\nHornsby Shire Council) has an estimated area of 357 hectares. The estimated total\narea of Terrys Creek is therefore approximately 1012 hectares.\n\nThe Eastwood town centre is located within the Eastwood subcatchment, and straddles\nthe Main Northern Railway Line (Figures 1 and 2). The railway embankment divides\nthe Eastwood town centre into eastern and western halves.\n\nModels\n\nThe DRAINS software has been used to model the hydrologic regime of the Terrys\nCreek catchment to its confluence with the Lane Cove River (see Figure 2).\nDRAINS is a comprehensive hydrologic modelling program for designing and analysing\nvarious types of catchments and urban stormwater drainage systems. It also includes\nsome hydraulic modelling capabilities for pipes and overland flowpaths. It was first\nreleased in January 1998 and is marketed by Watercom Pty Ltd. The software is widely\nused in Australia and Council itself has used DRAINS for many years.\n\nFollowing various discussions with Council officers, the widely used and Australian\ndeveloped TUFLOW model (Reference 9) was chosen as the principal hydraulic\nmodelling tool for use in the study.\nThere were seen to be numerous advantages of using a sophisticated two-dimensional\n(2D) model such as TUFLOW for simulating flood conditions within Terrys Creek and its\ntributaries. These advantages included not only the model’s ability to simulate flood\nflows along a complicated network of overland flowpaths such as occurs in the study\narea, but also the ability of the model to produce figures to aid community\nunderstanding and acceptance of the flood study results.\nThe technical description of the TUFLOW model and its specific application to Terrys\nCreek is provided in Appendix B.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of boys who were fully immunised against human papillomavirus (HPV). The data spans the financial years 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic boundaries from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHPV is a common sexually transmitted infection. It is estimated that more than four out of five people will have an HPV infection at some point in their lives. Although often asymptomatic, HPV infection can cause a wide range of cancers, including cervical cancer, and other conditions such as genital warts. The Australian Government introduced the school-based National HPV Vaccination Program in 2007 for adolescent girls, and extended it to include boys in January 2013. The data were sourced from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register), which is operated by the Victorian Cytology Service. The HPV Register records information about HPV vaccine doses administered under the National HPV Vaccination Program in Australia. The data reported are for girls and boys aged 15 who had received three doses of HPV vaccine by 30 June 2016 (as at 12 August 2017). The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females and males aged 13 at 30 June 2014 was used for the denominator, as this reflects the eligible population at the time most vaccinations were administered.\n                                                For further information about this dataset, visit the data source:[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - HPV immunisation rates in 2015-16 Data Tables.](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/immunisation/hpv-immunisation-rates-2015-16/data)\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese data include boys aged 15 who had received three doses of HPV vaccine by 30 June 2015 and 2016. Any doses administered after that date are not included and therefore the current coverage in this cohort may be higher than reported here. Only vaccinations reported to the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register) are included.\n\n\nBoys whose courses are considered to be incomplete according to the Chief Medical Officer guidelines and boys who do not wish their details to be recorded on the HPV Register are excluded.\n\n",

Each bay can also link to it's parking meter, and parking sensor information.\n\n\n\nHow the data joins:\n\n\n\nThere are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay information. \n\nThe way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay information don’t currently join.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease see City of Melbourne's disclaimer regarding the use of this data. https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/stories/s/94s9-uahn",
