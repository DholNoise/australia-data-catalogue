    "description": "This spatial product was built in direct response to the public's, industry's and governments demand/requirement for a National Bushfire Boundary layer during and after the 2020 Black Summer Bushfires.\r\n\r\nEmergency Management Spatial information Network Australia (EMSINA) members (National and the Developers) begun developing this consolidated National Bushfire Boundary Webservice on December 30, 2019. With the technical assistance of Esri Australia the first public facing product (v1) became available on January 8, 2020. Geoscience Australia staff were involved in the development and maintenance of the FME scripts.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 of the product was released in February as EMSINA and Geoscience Australia began automating the product. This release exhibited a reformatted attributed table to accommodate the new automation scripts; unfortunately this release resulted in having to release the data with new access end points.\r\n\r\nThe product was continuously developed until early May 2020. On May 4, 2020 the EMSINA Committee made the decision to stop running the script i.e. 1 month after the official end of the bushfire season.\r\n\r\nThe product and the scripting were subsequently archived on both EMSINA and GA infrastructure. The National Bushfire Recovery Agency was provided a copy of the automation scripts on May 7, 2020 and then on June 26, 2020 a complete copy of the data from January 8, 2020 to May 4, 2020 in a geodatabase format. \r\n\r\nThe EMSINA Group formally ended their technical involvement with this project on June 30, 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Management LINK (EM-LINK*) catalogue was the source for identifying the majority of the required data. The consolidated National Bushfire Boundary Webservice contains data from:\r\n\r\n Australian Capital Territory - Emergency Service Agency (ESA)\r\n\r\n New South Wales - Rural Fire Service (RFS)\r\n\r\n Queensland - Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES)\r\n\r\n Queensland - Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES)\r\n\r\n South Australia - Country Fire Service (CFS)\r\n\r\n Tasmania - Tasmania Fire Service (TFS)\r\n\r\n Victoria - Emergency Management Victoria (EMV)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere EMSINA and/or Geoscience Australia had difficulty in accessing the required spatial data and/or attributes assistance was provided by the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and Emergency Management Australia.\r\n\r\nKnown Limitations of the Data:\r\n\r\nThis database does not contain information from Western Australia. Neither EMSINA nor the Australian Government were able to negotiate appropriate access to the State’s operational boundary data.\r\n\r\nEMSINA is aware of duplicate data (features) contained within this database. This duplicate data is commonly represented in the regions around state lines where it became operationally necessary to understand cross border situations. Care must be taken when summing the values to obtain a total area burnt. \r\n\r\nEMSINA and Geoscience Australia became aware of the following error in the database in April 2020:\r\n\r\n- Upon receipt of the Queensland data it was mistakenly assessed as Operational Boundaries and not as Historic FY Boundaries. This data was included into the database until the mistake was discovered in early April.\r\n\r\nThe data within this aggregated National product is a representation of the input data received from the custodian agencies. Therefore, to assess the quality or find out more information about an individual feature or features it is recommend that you contact the appropriate custodian.\r\n",

    "description": "We request time to observe 270 pulsars on a regular basis in order to achieve three main science goals. The first is to understand pulsars: how do they spin down and what disrupts this process, how and why their profiles vary with time, whether they precess or have planetary mass companions, in short all the things that make pulsar timing noisier than the perfect clock. Secondly we want to understand the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through repeated monitoring of dispersion measure, rotation measure and flux density variations in conjunction with scintillation parameters. Finally, we provide these data as a community service both to the high-energy community where we have strong collaborative links (particularly to Fermi) and to the radio pulsar astronomers generally through the CSIRO archive. The project is on-going since 2007, we are (co-)authors on 106 papers arising from the P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of students from Bordeaux, Manchester, Oxford, Stanford, and Swinburne. We are seeking long-term project status with a view to continuing the project into the SKA era.",

    "description": "IBRA regions represent a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia from a range of continental data on environmental attributes.  85 biogeographic regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment.\nIBRA Version 5.1 is the result of refinement of the IBRA Version 4 boundaries.  These refined boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies.  Following a Departmentally facilitated workshop on the revision of boundaries on 24 July 2000, spatial data refinements were undertaken by DEWHA in conjunction with relevant State / Territory agencies.  Agreement from all contributing parties, to make the final IBRA5_1 dataset publicly available, was gained in November 2000.\nNominal attributes for the IBRA are; climate, lithology/geology, landform, vegetation, flora and fauna, and landuse.  The use of these attributes varies across the States and details can be found in \"Revision of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia (IBRA) and Development of Version 5.1 - Summary Report\", DEH, Sept 2000.\nThis dataset is available in ArcInfo export file format, Projection Geographicals, Datum and Spheroid WGS84.

Aboveground biomass refers to the amount of carbon stored within aboveground forest components (pools) which includes leaves, branches, bark and stems. Belowground biomass refers to the amount of carbon stored within belowground forest components (pools) which includes coarse and fine roots. Dead Organic Matter refers to the amount of carbon stored within dead forest components (pools) which includes leaf litter, branch litter, bark litter, stem litter, and dead roots.

A national network of RDA committees has been established to achieve this objective.\r\n \r\nRDA Regions are created and maintained by the Dept. of Infrastructure and Regional Development to support this initiative.\r\n \r\nNotes\r\n \r\nThe RDA Regions (2014-15) were built from the ABS LGA 2014 boundary dataset. \r\n\r\nThe RDA spatial data is updated as new LGA boundaries are released by ABS or as RDA regional boundaries move.\r\n \r\nOn the 16th of August 2011, the RDA representation of Lord Howe Island, previously RDA Northern Rivers was changed to RDA Mid North Coast. The 2011 dataset was updated to reflect this change.\r\n \r\nNT, Tas and ACT\r\n \r\nThese states and territories are defined as single RD regions.  West Daly RC, which deamalgamated from Victoria-Daly RC was added 1/7/14\r\n\r\nSA\r\n \r\nRDA regions are not completely defined within LGA boundaries, with some RDA regions being defined from the previously existing 2007 South Australia Government Region boundaries. Thus, the large unincorporated LGA (Outback Communities Authority) is divided between 3 RDAs (see SA Government Regions for more information).\r\n \r\nNSW\r\n \r\nRDA South Coast includes the external territory of Jervis Bay. In previous data releases, Lord Howe Island (part of the ABS Unincorporated NSW) was part of  RDA Northern Rivers. On the 16 of August 2011, Lord Howe Island was to be represented by Mid North Coast.\r\n \r\nNorfolk Island IS NOT part of any RDA \r\n\r\nVIC\r\n \r\nUnincorporated VIC (Snow fields and Islands) have been combined into their surrounding RDA's\r\n \r\nWA\r\n \r\nThe external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos/Keeling Islands are part of RD Mid West Gascoyne.\r\n \r\nThere was also an amalgamation between the City of Geraldton-Greenough and Shire of Mullewa on the 1st of July 2011 to form the City of Greater Geraldton. The LGA code for Geraldton-Greenough (53520) was retained for the new City of Greater Geraldton.\r\n\r\nQLD\r\n \r\nOn the 1/1/14, 4 councils deamalgamated.  Mareeba Shire reformed from Tablelands Regional, Douglas Shire reformed from Cairns Regional, Livingstone Shire from Rockhampton Regional and Noosa Shire from Sunshine Coast Regional.  LGA boundaries had minor adjustments from the 2007 boundaries, but there were no changes to the RDA boundaries.\r\n ",

    "description": "The acoustic surveys were designed to collect male koala bellows on private native forest. To date there have been very few formal studies looking at koala occupancy in private native forest. The surveys were carried out during the breeding season, spanning spring into early summer. With repeat surveys over consecutive nights to account for imperfect detection in an occupancy modelling framework.\nData was collected using AudioMoth acoustic recorders. The raw WAV files were processed using koala recognisers Ecoacoustics Audio Analysis (version 2). Recordings matched by the koala recogniser were validated by manually visualising spectrograms of the audio and listening to recordings to check for false positives. The data was manipulated into an Occupancy format for analyses.\nThese acoustic data were collected by the landholder on private property. Landholders signed an agreement which prevents DPIRD publishing location data for the survey sites. Records of species (koalas) are published to BioNet at the landholder's discretion - as per the legal agreement. Data published is presence/absence data for the survey period at each site.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of antenatal care visits in the first trimester for all women giving birth, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and who had their first antenatal care visit (before 14 weeks gestation), divided by the total number of females who gave birth with a stated first antenatal care visit, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. Gestational age at the time of the first antenatal care visit is assessed from the best estimate of gestational age available.\n\n\nAn antenatal care visit is an intentional encounter between a pregnant female and a midwife or doctor prior to labour to assess and improve maternal and fetal wellbeing throughout pregnancy and prior to labour.\n\n\nAll females who gave birth are included for the calculation of this indicator.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nRecords with missing or invalid data for gestational age at first antenatal visit were removed from the denominator. The valid range for gestational age is 3-46 weeks.\n\n\nFrom 2014, Caesarean section at most recent previous birth indicator data item was introduced into the Perinatal NMDS. Although not an NMDS/DSS item prior to 2014, data items appear to match the data element developed by NPDDC, Caesarean section indicator (last previous birth).\n\n\nFor ACT, the first antenatal visit is often the first hospital antenatal clinic visit, scheduled for around 16-18 weeks of pregnancy. In many cases, earlier antenatal care provided by the woman’s general practitioner is not reported.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "The Polynya3 (Mertz region) deepwater mooring was deployed on 2011-01-23 at (-66.15 S, 143.01 E) off the Adelie Land Coast in Antarctica, and currently remains in place, inaccessible due to pack ice. In February 2014 a second array was deployed in a new location near the Totten Glacier.\n\nInstrumentation includes 75kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (RDI longranger ADCPs), and Seabird SBE37s (SM, SMP and SMP-ODO).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurement at four depth on each mooring, between the seafloor and 300m depth (the mooring are limited to this depth to avoid contact with icebergs).\n\nThis Polynya mooring array will re-continue the time series of bottom water export begun in 2008, using observation strategy, modified as required following recovery of the array in 2009.\n\nThe aim of the IMOS Polynya mooring array is to measure the export of dense Antarctic Bottom Water from the Adélie Land coast. Sinking of dense water near Antarctica supplies the deep branch of the global overturning circulation, a pattern of ocean currents that strongly influences climate. Several studies have recently shown that the properties of the bottom water in the Australian Antarctic Basin are changing. Monitoring the temperature, salinity and oxygen of bottom water will provide observations to detect how the Southern Ocean limb of the overturning circulation is responding to changes in high latitude climate forcing. The goal of the new Totten region location is to obtain measurements of \"warm\" inflow to, and (if possible) outflow from the Totten Glacier system. As it happened, access right to the Totten was not possible, and moorings were sited closer to the Dalton Iceberg Tongue and Moscow University Ice Shelf, possibly part of the Totten inflow story.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the measurement of Secchi Depth and Total suspended solids (inorganic and organic components) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling.\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "    \n\nGross Benefit of the Limiting Factor (gb97m = p97m a pfe97) ($/ha/yr) dataset\nis one of 11 national surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to\neconomic opportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are\ngiven in 1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this\ndataset: relative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described\nas follows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a03.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "Three geologists left Australia in 1951 to conduct geological surveys in Pakistan, under the auspices of the Colombo Plan which provides technical assistance for member countries in South and South East Asia. The main objects were to conduct an economic and general geological survey of a selected part of the Gilgit Agency, to examine the alluvial-gold prospects of the Chitral River, and, if time permitted, to discuss the Sind and East Bengal lignites with the Director of the Pakistan Geological Survey. This report is confined to the geological surveys in the Gilgit Agency. In June 1951, the party commenced field work from Gilgit, and spent three month in the region. Several reported mineral occurrences were examined in the Hunza, Nagir, Gilgit, Haramosh, Gupis, Ishkuman, and Yasin areas; a regional geological survey of approximately 5,000 square miles was completed.",

    "description": "This data was collected in September 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS072010.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, September 7, 2010\nArrived:  \t Hobart, Australia, September 15, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The behaviour of U. capricornis is not well-known. Consequently, observations were made for approximately 1100 hours over 4 seasons to obtain a general picture of their social system and behaviour. The study was conducted on a large population of Uca capricornis in the vicinity of the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin. Fieldwork was conducted yearly from November-January, 2002-2006. \n\nTo obtain a more detailed description of the relationship between males and females, the natural interactions between males and females living as nearest neighbours were recorded. Twenty-one pairs were filmed from overhead for a period of 30 minutes. Any activity was noted, as was any interactions with intruders. \n\nTerritoriality was also examined, providing the overall area covered by the crabs within the half hour. By aligning the male and female territories with their respective burrows it was possible to determine the area overlap between them.",

    "description": "This data was collected in March and April 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST012010.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart, Australia, March 29, 2010\nArrived:  \t Fremantle, Australia, April 7, 2010\n\nDeparted:  Fremantle, Australia, April 7, 2010\nArrived:  \t Broome, Australia, April 13, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nAll banks operating in Australia complete ARF 231. Between March 2003 and September 2010, only those larger RFCs with sizeable overseas assets and/or liabilities completed RRF 231. Bank and RFC positions are reported in Australian dollars (AUD). Non-AUD denominated positions have been converted to AUD using an appropriate end-quarter exchange rate, so changes in reported data between quarters are due not only to changes in positions but also valuation gains or losses due to exchange rate changes.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only locational data are reported in this statistical table.  \r\n\r\nSome liabilities are reported at market value, but contractual or nominal values are used where market values are not appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe locational data presented in this statistical table may differ from the balance sheet data reported by banks (and RFCs between March 2003 and September 2010) in their ARF/RRF 320.0 Statement of Financial Position return to APRA (and published in statistical tables B2, B3, B9 and B10). ARF/RRF 231 asks for gross positions to be reported (including on-balance sheet derivatives). However, in ARF/RRF 320.0, derivative positions can be reported on a net asset or net liability basis. This difference is particularly relevant in the case of foreign currency derivative positions with residents in Australia (included in other assets and other liabilities in the locational data).\r\n\r\nData are shown for a selected group of countries that account for the bulk of the total. Similar data for other countries are also available in statistical table B12.2.1.\r\n\r\nThe positions by country are summed to produce a ‘Total non-residents’ figure that represents reporting entities’ total positions with offshore counterparties in all currencies. The positions shown for Australia are positions with residents in foreign currency.\r\n\r\n‘Deposits’ comprise all claims reflecting evidence of deposit – including non-negotiable certificates of deposit – that are not represented by negotiable securities. Thus, loans and deposits include interbank borrowings, loans and inter-office balances, foreign trade-related credits, international loans received and granted, and deposits received and made on a trust basis.\r\n\r\nSale and repurchase transactions (repos) involving the sale of assets (e.g. securities and gold) with a commitment to repurchase the same or similar assets, financial leases, promissory notes, non-negotiable debt securities, endorsement liabilities arising from bills rediscounted abroad and subordinated loans (including subordinated non-negotiable debt securities) are also included as ‘Deposits’.\r\n\r\n‘Debt securities issued’ are all negotiable short- and long-term debt instruments (including subordinated issues and issues in an entity’s own name but on behalf of third parties). The classification as international debt securities issued is determined by the place and currency of issue rather than the residence of the issuer as in the case of reporting entities’ holdings of debt securities. This criterion is used due to the difficulty of determining the residence of the current holder of a negotiable instrument.\r\n\r\n‘Other liabilities’ include on-balance sheet derivative contracts and working capital received by local branches from their head offices abroad. Accrued interest and items in the course of collection are also included in other assets and liabilities.\r\n",

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Crawford School of Economics and Government at The Australian National University in Canberra.\r\n*****\r\nUnpredictable environmental fluctuations are a major problem in fisheries. To mitigate these uncertainties, reserves are advocated to help ensure population persistence, reduce population and harvest variance and to provide a hedge against management failures. Using recent insights from the modelling of marine reserves that indicate that reserves can generate a win-win in terms of economic payoffs and ecological benefits, we propose a six-step process for managing reserves with uncertainty and argue in favour of initially establishing less than desirable reserve sizes where stakeholder resistance to reserves may be preventing their implementation.",

    "description": "In 2005 Geoscience Australia and the National Oceans Office undertook a joint project to produce a consistent, high-quality 9 arc second (0.0025 decimal degree (dd) or ~250m at the equator) bathymetric grid for Australian waters. In 2009 a number of new datasets were included in an updated version of the grid.\n, The 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia was produced to include recently acquired datasets, and solutions to issues identified in the previous version. The revised grid has the same extents as its 2005 counterpart, including the Australian water column jurisdiction lying between 92o E and 172o E, and 8o S and 60o S. The waters adjacent to the continent of Australia and Tasmania are included, as are areas surrounding Macquarie Island, and the Australian Territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The area selected does not include Australia's marine jurisdiction offshore from the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory.\n, As per the 2005 grid, the 0.0025 dd resolution is only supported where direct bathymetric observations are sufficiently dense (e.g. where swath bathymetry data or digitised chart data exist) (Webster and Petkovic, 2005). In areas where no sounding data are available (in waters off the Australian shelf), the grid is based on the 2 arc minute ETOPO (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) and 1 arc minute ETOPO (Amante and Eakins, 2008) satellite derived bathymetry. The topographic data (on shore data) is based on the revised Australian 0.0025dd topography grid (Geoscience Australia, 2008), the 0.0025dd New Zealand topography grid (Geographx, 2008) and the 90m SRTM DEM (Jarvis et al, 2008).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Part of a suite of polygon datasets that best represent remnants of original pre-1750 vegetation across the mapped areas as at 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2024. The polygons represent interpreted areas of vegetation using current and historical digital aerial photography (1953-present) sourced from State Government repositories and other commercial products e.g. Digital globe, ESRI wayback imagery and Google. Simplified condition of the vegetation has been attributed to some polygons.\n\nThe mapped area covers the Metropolitan and Peel Region Schemes, the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion as defined in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia V 7.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2025) and the Swan Coastal Plain vegetation complexes (DBCA-046) (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2016).\n\nFor further information refer to Explanatory Report titled 'Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel remnant native vegetation extent mapping in 2000-2020 (5 yearly interval) and the year 2024.pdf'",

    "description": "IBRA version 5.1 Sub-regions, like their parent regionalisation IBRA version 5.1, represent a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia from a range of continental data on environmental attributes, at a finer scale.  354 IBRA Sub-regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment.\nThe IBRA Version 5.1 Sub-regions are the result of refinement of the IBRA Version 4 boundaries.  These refined boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies.  Following a DEH facilitated workshop on the revision of boundaries on 24 July 2000, spatial data refinements were undertaken by DEH in conjunction with relevant State / Territory agencies. \n\nNominal attributes for the IBRA and IBRA Sub-regions are; climate, lithology/geology, landform, vegetation, flora and fauna, and landuse.  The use of these attributes varies across the States.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. \n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Heritage) 2000",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to estimate past sea-surface temperature in the Southeast Indian Ocean. The accumulation of diatom microplankton assemblages in sediments being the proxy for these records of climatic change. \n\nA transfer function is a mathematical method that allows quantitative estimations of environmental parameters from past biogenic sedimentation. In this study, a diatom transfer function was established to relate biological species to selected environmental parameter of the ocean (sea-surface temp). These equations were then employed on observed fossil species from core samples to provide quantitative estimates of sea-surface temperature.\n\nEstimates of sea-surface temperature are given here based on the assemblages of diatoms found in core MD88-787. The information provided gives the extrapolated age-scale through the core, and two estimates of feb SST based on different diatom transfer functions (DTF 109/24/6 and DTF 166/34/4). \n\nIt is probable that the 'real' SST signal lies between the model estimates. The model diagnostics and lower number of non-analogue events from DTF 109/24/6 over that of results produced by DTF 166/34/4 suggest that SST estimates are closer to those provided by the former model.",

    "description": "This Bio Acoustic data was collected in September 2011 under the IMOS Ship of Opportunity (SOOP) Bio Acoustic (BA) program on Austral Fisheries FV Southern Champion (IMOS platform code: VHGI).\n\nDeparted:  Australia, September 6, 2011\nArrived:  \t Australia, September 8, 2011\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The Land Monitor salinity mapping process uses satellite imagery, high-resolution topographic data, ground information and ancillary GIS data sets to map areas of severely salt-affected land identified in consecutive satellite (Landsat TM) scenes (Furby et al 2010). To update the 1990 and 1998 estimates, the spatial-temporal methodology was re-applied using the same approach but took advantage of the latest data and improved computational resources (Caccetta et al 2022). Any changes in the extent of salt affected land detected by Land Monitor in the updated salinity mapping are most likely within the severe salinity class and may represent either expansions of this class of salinity or improvements in the condition of severely salt affected land or in the reduction of commission errors (compared to the original mapping).\n\nThis data has converted the salt effected areas to a vector geodatabase. Additional post processing to remove urban areas has been applied.",

    "description": "##Ipswich Planning Scheme\r\nThe 2006 Consolidated Ipswich Planning Scheme covers the entire local government area. In most instances it includes roads and watercourses. The Planning Scheme was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the repealed Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) and the Department of Local Government and Planning guidelines and scheme template.\r\n\r\nCouncil adopted the Consolidated Planning Scheme (including all amendments to the 2004 Ipswich Planning Scheme) on 14 December 2005, and took effect (ie commencement date) on 23 January 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme divides the Ipswich Local Government Area into 8 localities-\r\n\r\nUrban Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nCity Centre\r\n\r\n\r\nRegionally Significant Business Enterprise and Industry Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nAmberley\r\n\r\n\r\nRosewood\r\n\r\n\r\nTownship Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nRural Areas, and\r\n\r\n\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach locality is further divided into Zones and in some cases, Sub Areas and Precincts. The planning scheme also provides a secondary organisational layer called Overlays, which are based on special attributes of land that need to be protected, or that may constrain development. There are two types of overlays - character places overlays and development constraints overlays.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme uses the concepts of Overall Outcomes, Specific Outcomes, Probable Solutions and Acceptable Solutions for a zone, overlay or code.\r\n\r\nOverall Outcomes are essentially the overall purpose or intent statements. Specific Outcomes are the more detailed performance objectives.\r\n\r\nProbable Solutions represent one way of achieving a specific outcome and may be either increased or decreased by the Local Government depending on the individual circumstances of the proposal.\r\n\r\nAcceptable Solutions apply only to self-assessable development and represent a precise measure for compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the zoning of a property, it is also imperative to refer to the overlay maps and associated overlay codes (see Part 11) in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development compared to the underlying zone, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nAlso, in addition to the overlays affecting a property, it is also imperative to refer to the zoning maps and associated zone codes in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nData made available under CC-BY-ND terms.\r\nData updated on changes to Scheme.",

The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who felt they waited longer than acceptable to get an appointment with a GP. The data spans the years of 2013-2014 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Geofabric Groundwater Cartography product is a first pass national groundwater dataset bringing together existing groundwater mapping by collating and integrating the 'best' available, Commonwealth, state and regional groundwater mapping datasets across Australia. Although there are gaps in the information every effort has been made to reduce or minimise inconsistencies and conflicts in overlapping and abutting data sets and in attribution and definitions of the input data sets. In generating the various national aquifer datasets an interim national groundwater framework has been developed to relate geological units and regional and state groundwater aquifer mapping units to a nationally consistent set of aquifers and aquitards. The purpose of this framework is to provide a transparent mapping of aquifers from geological units, state or regional groundwater aquifer mapping (where available) and the interim national product. Such an approach was necessary to resolve inconsistencies in aquifer naming and definition across State borders. This product contains five Geofabric feature types including: Aquifer Boundary, Aquifer Outcrop, Contour, Water Table Aquifer and Surficial Hydrogeology Unit). It also contains five Interim Groundwater (IGW) feature types including: IGW Aquifer Salinity, IGW Aquifer Yield, IGW Water Table Salinity, IGW Water Table Yield and Water Table Hydraulic Conductivity.",

    "description": "Electrofishing and fyke net fish catches collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nAbundance and diversity of riverine fish populations are monitored annually at fixed sites within six Selected Areas using a standardised sampling regime involving boat or backpack electrofishing and fine mesh fyke nets (referred to as Category 1 sampling). These methods target large-bodied and small-bodied fish species respectively. All fish were returned to the water after capture and measurement. These data are the catch data.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Fish Adult Catch.

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This database contains geochemical data for samples analysed both for inorganic and organic geochemistry. Analytical data are sourced from Geoscience Australia's Inorganic Geochemistry Database (OZCHEM) and Organic Geochemistry Database (ORGCHEM), respectively. The data are joined on a unique sample number. Inorganic geochemical data cover the majority of the periodic table, with metadata on analytical methods and detection limits. Organic geochemical data include results of pyrolysis, derivative calculated values, and, where available, isotopic composition of carbonates (D13C) and isotopic composition of rock nitrogen (D15N). Further, there are provisions for delivery of isotopic data for kerogen (H, C, N) and oxygen (O) for carbonates. Where available, sample descriptions include stratigraphic unit names and ages, and lithology. Location information includes coordinates of the sampled feature (eg, borehole), coordinates of the sample and sample depth. Interpretation of the combined inorganic and organic geochemistry for organic-rich shales will facilitate comprehensive characterisation of hydrocarbons source rocks and mineral commodities source and trap environments. All are achieved within the frameworks of petroleum and mineral systems analysis. The initial data delivered by this service include 1785 samples from 35 boreholes from 14 geological provinces, including recently released data for 442 samples from the South Nicholson National Drilling Initiative Carrara 1 stratigraphic drill hole (Butcher et al., 2021; Carson et al., 2021). Many sampled boreholes are located within the polygon of the Exploring for the Future Barkly-Isa-Georgetown project. This dataset will be updated periodically as more data become available.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for December 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThe dataset provides a summary for all the locations where maximum drawdown impact and the time when the maximum drawdown impact occurs are generated by the Clarence-Moreton groundwater model. A total of 982 pilot points were selected for layer 1. For other layers, the groundwater model provided predictions at locations where economic receptors were registered in companion product 1.4 for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion. In total, 1462 predication locations are described in the dataset with their corresponding layer numbers.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset is an extraction from pre-registered datasets as specified in the dataset lineage. \n\n\n\nMajor actions applied to the extraction include:\n\n1.\tClip the economic receptors associated with groundwater using the Clarence-Moreton groundwater model boundary.\n\n2.\tAssign the economic receptors derived in step 1 to a specific layer in the groundwater model using the aquifer assignment database compiled in companion product 2.1/2.2.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) CLM groundwater model prediction location.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n The report A stocktake of selected agricultural markets of the European Union: Opportunities for Australia compiles five articles on EU agricultural industries that were originally published in ABARES Agricultural Commodities quarterly reports between June 2016 and March 2017. These articles were on almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. The report examines EU domestic policies and markets, and trade opportunities for Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Since the mid 1990s the share of total Australian exports destined for the EU has been declining in favour of more lucrative and geographically closer Asian markets. \r\n• Part of the reason for the decline in the share of Australian exports to the EU has been caused by the regulation that supports the EU agricultural sector. EU agricultural imports are subject to restrictive quotas, in-quota tariffs and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• The Australian Government and the European Commission are working towards commencing negotiations for a free trade agreement. As the European Union is one of the largest consumers of agricultural goods in the world, a preferential agreement that improves access to the EU market may present opportunities for Australian agricultural exporters. \r\n• The commodities covered in this report are almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. These are high value or growing Australian agricultural industries. \r\n• The EU imports agricultural products from a large number of countries and has numerous existing trade arrangements with these countries. Australia therefore faces significant competition in the EU market for the five commodities. \r\n• The articles discuss the existing trade trends and EU policies for each of the five commodities. For beef, dairy and sugar it is posited that only a significant reduction in tariffs or enlargement of quotas would precipitate a strong diversion of Australian trade away from the geographically closer Asian markets to the European Union. This is because of weakening EU import demand given growing supplies of lower-priced, domestically produced product. \r\n• Australian exports of sheep meat to the European Union are constrained by a relatively small quota of 20,000 tonnes, which it has largely filled in each of the past 5 years. Australian exporters of sheep meat would benefit from improved access to that market given strengthening EU demand for sheep meat and relatively high prices. \r\n• EU imports of almonds are subject to a low tariff and import demand has been growing steadily. Removal of the tariff on Australian almonds would improve Australia's relative competitiveness but gains are expected to be modest over the medium term given the dominant foothold of the United States in the EU almond market. \r\n• The effect of Brexit on EU agricultural commodities markets and trade is uncertain at this stage. \r\n",

    "description": "All designated neighbourhood government schools (referred to as a local school) have a school zone. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English language schools, selective entry high schools, or community schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nEvery Victorian child has the legislated right to enrol at their local government school. A school zone does not restrict a student's  choice to seek enrolment at other government schools. Students can enrol at a school outside their zone if the school has sufficient accommodation and it aligns with the school’s enrolment management implementation plan, where applicable.\nFor students residing in metropolitan Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the local school is usually the nearest government school in a straight line from the student’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is usually the nearest school by the shortest practical route, recognising the additional travel distances often experienced in regional settings.\nIt is recognised that some school zones need to be aligned with geographical and structural barriers that significantly impede direct school access such as rivers and freeways. A main road with pedestrian crossings, however, is not usually considered to be a barrier to accessing a school.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect new schools opening, changing provision at existing schools (e.g., relocating a campus or changing year levels offered), improving school accessibility, or managing enrolment demand.\nThe school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website. More information on Victorian school zones can found at https://www.vic.gov.au/school-zones.\nSchool zones have been produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. The location point for all government schools is taken from the department’s register of school locations. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset have been used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2017 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions dataset is maintained for the purpose of reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries. \n\nThis 2015 version defines the Peel-Harvey NRM region. A boundary for the newly established OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation has not been spatially defined. It has responsibility for enhancing fish habitats and improving water quality in estuaries and coastal marine environments. OceanWatch works with the fishing industry to continue the adoption of industry best harvesting practice and identify issues of common interest for fishers across Australia.\n\nThe 2015 version maintains the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas. The 2012 version updated and formalised the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset. Whilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\n\nSince 2006, NRM regions have been important in the delivery of Australian Government funding initiatives including Caring for our Country, the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Landcare Program, the Environmental Stewardship Program and the Working on Country Indigenous land and sea ranger program.\n\nIn total, this dataset represents 61 regions as set out below. They comprise 56 mainland regions administered by 55 NRM regional bodies (the Cooperative Management Area in QLD is jointly administered by the two adjacent regional bodies: the Cape York and Northern Gulf NRM bodies) and seven islands (five administered by the Australian Government as external territories, and two administered by nearby mainland NRM regional bodies).\n\nQueensland\n1.

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - New South Wales Monthly Trains Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2019",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in New South Wales (NSW), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of New South Wales connected by Sydney trains (T1-T9) and Metro services (Metro North West line) have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "As part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018) the Melbourne Water operating region was split into a series of sub-regions. This includes 5 catchments, and 69 sub-catchments. The boundaries of each region generally follow catchment boundaries. There are two separate spatial scales:- Catchments (5 regions: Werribee, Maribyrnong, Yarra, Dandenong, Westernport) and Sub-catchments (69 polygons). This dataset is an update to the Regional River Health Strategy (RRHS) Management Units layer created in 2008. Primary purpose of this data is for reporting of targets, performance objectives, conditions, values etc. relating to the Healthy Waterways Strategy.The sub-catchments in this dataset are an update of the \"management units\" developed for the Regional River Health Strategy in 2008. This dataset was created by merging sub-catchments from the University of Melbourne sub-catchments layer, commonly referred to as the DCI layer (where DCI refers to Directly Connected Imperviousness). The catchment polygons in this layer are similar to, but not exactly the same as those in the DCI layer currently used internally at Melbourne Water - The internally used layer has 15,901 polygon catchments, whilst the layer used to create this dataset has 16,346 polygon catchments. The Melbourne Water internal dataset will shortly be updated to align.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains polygon and line shapefiles representing the Gloucester terrestrial (both a multipart and singlepart version) and riverine Landscape Classes respectively. It also contains KMZ exports of these features.\n\n\n\nNote: This differs from previous versions in that the extent was extended to the Gloucester AE boundary (previously  the extent was to the PAE) so the discontinuous river lines that weaved in and out of the PAE boundary could be wholly included.\n\n\n\nThe polygon landscape Classes are as follows.\n\n\n\nTerrestrial (polygons)\n\nForrested Wetlands\n\nFreshwater Wetlands\n\nRainforests\n\nDry sclerophyll forests\n\nWet sclerophyll forests\n\nSaline wetlands\n\n(Non-GDE) Native vegetation\n\nPlantation or production forestry\n\nDryland agriculture\n\nIrrigated agriculture\n\nIntensive uses (includes mining)\n\n\n\nNote forestry that selectively logs native forests is included in the \"(Non-GDE) Native vegetation\" class rather than the economic \"Plantation and production foresstry\" class.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe terrestrial Landscape class polygons are sourced directly from the two input polygon source datasets and clipped to the Gloucester PAE.\n\n\n\nGDE landscape classes derive directly from the source NSW OoW GDE layer's Keith Form attribute, though the \"Riverine Forests\" Keith form are combined with the \"Forested Wetlands\" LC and the \"Mangrove Swamps\" and \"Saltmarshes\" Keith Forms are combined to form the \"Saline Wetlands\" LC . \n\n\n\nThe remaining non-GDE terrestrial LC polygons are mainly sourced from the ACLUM catchment landuse from the PRIMARY V7 classification, and retain the source class names except that  \"1 Conservation and natural environments\" is rename the \"non-GDE Native Vegtation\" LC.  A further exception  is the \"Plantation and Production Forestry\" LC. This is derived from the SECONDARY_V7 classification where:\n\n\n\n\"SecondV7\" = '2.2 Production forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '3.1 Plantation forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '4.1 Irrigated plantation forestry'\n\n\n\nThe Riverine LC lines are derived directly from the Rivertypes source dataset\n\n\n\nNote for the 2016 March 9 IESC Deep Dive for GLO was necessary to tease out the Keith Forms of the \"non-GDE native vegetaton\" Landscape class in order to generate areal statistics for endangered species habitats. These were sourced from the Greater Hunter vegetation mapping.

    "description": "<b>Version Oct 2021  </b>\nThe Building Heights Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils. \n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the location of business listings from Sands &amp; McDougall's Directory of Victoria. The data was created by digitising the published business directories using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. The extracted information includes the business name, address and business type as listed in the Sands &amp; McDougall directories. The address information was subsequently geocoded to provide a spatial location. The data spans the the Sands &amp; McDougall's Directory of Victoria publication years 1896, 1925 and 1974.\nVictoria Unearthed is a collection of data which includes past and present information about historical businesses, potential land and groundwater contamination, as well as information about contamination management and cleanup activities. Victoria Unearthed has been created in response to the Independent Inquiry into the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Government of Victoria - Department of Land, Water and Planning.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAttributes captured by OCR (\"directory address\", \"business name\" and \"business type\") are uncorrected and may include errors.\n\n\nThe positional accuracy is affected by the limitations inherent with OCR and geocoding. Some issues such as changing street names, are exacerbated by the age of the records.\n\n\nThe directories were not consistent in the amount of information captured as the business address, in many cases it only lists the town or suburb for the business.\n\n\nA modern (July 2018) property address, street or locality as defined by VicMap has been captured for all records.\n\n\nAdditional information has been provided to allow the accuracy of the results to be evaluated with each record containing the data used at each stage of the data capture process.\n\n",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016</b>\nThe Overland Flow Path Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a05.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This study investigated the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of shrimp in Western Port Bay from July 1977 to January 1980. Water temperature, salinity and oxygen concentrations at the sediment surface were measured from a boat at high tide during the field sampling (see parent record 'The ecology and trophic role of caridean shrimps in the eelgrass community of Western Port, Victoria', File identifier: 268431c0-f18e-11dc-aaae-00188b4c0af8). Additional measurements of low tide surface water temperature over the mudflats, sediments below the mud-water interface, and surface waters of the large, permanent channels between mudbanks were obtained. Above-ground vegetation cover was sampled monthly for 12 months at Site A. \n\nThe water temperature in the eelgrass ranged from 10 to 24 degrees Celsius during high tide and from 5 to 31 degrees Celsius during low tide. Salinity was close to fully marine throughout the warmer months of 1977-78, but fell to lower levels during the cooler months of 1978, presumably as a result of higher rainfall in the latter period. Oxygen concentrations were above 6 ppm at all sites during high and low tide sampling. The dry mass of above-round eelgrass was spatially heterogeneous with few changes in these patterns between seasons.",

    "description": "This data was collected in March 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R4.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, March 1, 2011\nArrivec:  Hobart Australia, March 5, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "title": "A Probabilistic Assessment of Tsunami Hazard in the Indian Ocean",
    "description": "The Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004 made starkly evident the need for better information on tsunami hazard in the Indian Ocean. The tsunami threat faced by Indian Ocean countries consists of a complex mix of tsunami from local, regional and distant sources, whose effects at any particular location in the Indian Ocean are highly dependent on variations in sea floor shape between the source and affected coastlines, complicating tsunami disaster management and the design of tsunami warning systems for the Indian Ocean. In order to provide national governments in the Indian Ocean with the information they need to make informed decisions about tsunami mitigation measures, including development of a warning system,  a comprehensive hazard and risk ass\n\nIn this presentation we discuss the results of this assessment. The study focused on tsunami caused by subduction zone earthquakes, because they are the most frequent source of large tsunami, and tsunami hazard is expressed as annual probability of a tsunami exceeding a given amplitude at a given offshore depth. Because so little is known about the recurrence rates of large megathrust earthquakes in the subduction zones bordering the Indian Ocean, it was decided to develop two hazard maps: a 'low-hazard' end member, based on only those earthquake sources of tsunami for which there is definite evidence, and a 'high-hazard' end member, based on all potential megathrust earthquake sources, including hypothetical ones for which there is no historical or geological evidence, that may affect Indian Ocean coastlines. The actual hazard lies somewhere between these two end members, and the difference between the low hazard and high hazard maps is a simple and effective way to express the uncertainty in the hazard assessment. This uncertainty reflects the lack of knowledge of tsunamigenic earthquake occurrence, and can only be reduced through a better understanding of earthquake and tsunami occurrence in the Indian Ocean.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area). The total tree canopy cover estimate for Canberra for 2020 is based on the footprint of all urban divisions (suburbs): 22.5%.

The ACT 2020 LiDAR point clouds (Aerometrex and ACT Government 2020) are available from <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a><a> </a>(CCBY Licence).\n\n\n\nData lineage: This dataset is derived from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data captured by Aerometrex and ACT Government over ACT in April 2020. The point clouds were processed by the ACT Government with ArcGIS to produce ACT Canopy Cover footprint for vegetation above 3m. Canopy modelling was completed at 1m resolution. The canopy footprints were then augmented to block, division and road polygon coverage statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate system: GDA 2020 MGA Zone 55.\n\nTemporal coverage: April 2020\n\nUpdate schedule: every 5 years\n\n\n\nTile photo by Mark Jekabsons, Trees over Gungahlin\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveat: Comparison of the ACT 2020 Canopy Cover to the 2015 is not comparable due to differences in methodology, including differences in resolution and point density, and time of year the LiDAR was captured. The 2015 data was captured in late Autumn, whereas 2020 was captured in early Autumn.",

    "description": "This dataset provides a composite measure of heat vulnerability for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations in Australia, integrating three key indicators: heat exposure, heat sensibility, and heat adaptive capability. Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2014 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 1,126,441 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either:  \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed.  \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2014 car parking event data there are 3,377 records where the parking event goes into 2015 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.56GB, 51.5 million rows)",

    "description": "The prevalence of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in and around the Galactic center and the bulge has been one of the key questions in pulsar astronomy. In addition to finding more exotic and interesting binary systems at and around the Galactic center and bulge due to the enhanced density of stars/stellar remnants, MSPs are also proposed to be one of the candidates to explain the observed Fermi gamma-ray excess. However, most of the MSPs discovered so far are field (disk) MSPs or those in globular clusters. Initial steps towards addressing the question of Galactic center/bulge MSPs were made with the discovery of the first MSPs in a Galactic filament, but more progress comes from the discovery of a sample of MSPs around the Galactic center. Blind surveys targeting MSPs can suffer from many observational biases that smear the pulses due to binary acceleration, scattering from the enhanced density, and so on, which increases the parameter space for discovery and can sometimes make the problem intractable. However, if pulsar candidates can be identified reliably from imaging surveys, then targeted observations can make the problem tractable in identifying the pulsations. We followed up a sample of polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT bulge imaging survey and discovered a sample of 16 new MSPs. Here we request the timing observations of 8 interesting MSPs (a subset of our discovery sample), to study the binary nature of these sources and their potential inclusion in pulsar timing array efforts.",

    "description": "Age of individual fish collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nAbundance and diversity of riverine fish populations are monitored annually at fixed sites within six Selected Areas using a standardised sampling regime involving boat or backpack electrofishing and fine mesh fyke nets (referred to as Category 1 sampling). These methods target large-bodied and small-bodied fish species respectively. A sample of measured individuals (length and weight) were collected for otolith sectioning and age determination to construct age vs length and weight relationships.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Fish Age.

    "description": "Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) - Vegetation Complexes - SWF50k\n\nThe dataset is a comprehensive coverage of pre-1750 distribution of vegetation complexes of the south west forest region of Western Australia. This 1:50,000 mapping was undertaken by Mattiske and Havel (1998) as part of the biodiversity assessment for the comprehensive regional assessment for the south west forest region. The outputs from this project were used as inputs to the assessments of national estate, ecologically sustainable forest management, endangered species and the integration of all these values in the 1999 Regional Forest Agreement (RFA). This dataset covers the full extent mapped by Mattiske and Havel (1998) not just the area within the RFA boundary.\nIn March 2015 the dataset was reviewed to correct known and documented minor attributing errors and additional fields were incorporated including a unique numerical identifier (SWFor_ID). \n\nWebb et al. (2016) reviewed the 1:50,000 mapping of the Whicher Scarp and changes were made to ensure the complexes were a continuation of those defined by Mattiske and Havel (1998) and the extent of the landform correlated to that as defined by soil-landscape mapping (DAFWA 2007). In addition the review consolidated the boundaries along the Whicher and Darling Scarp interface with the Swan Coastal Plain. All Swan Coastal Plain complexes were removed and incorporated into the 2016 mapping of the “Swan Coastal Plain Vegetation Complexes” (Webb et al. 2016). ",

    "description": "The Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network (ACORN) facility comprises a coordinated network of HF radars delivering real-time, non-quality controlled and delayed-mode, quality controlled surface current data into a national archive. \n\nBased on experience in Europe and the USA, deployment of these radars is expected to make a profound change to coastal ocean research in Australia. HF radar provides unprecedented time-resolved surface current maps over the monitoring sites for physical and biological ocean research. \n\nDeployment of the radars is in support of regional nodes where there is a range of identified questions concerned with boundary currents and associated eddies and their interactions with shelf water and topography. In turn these are linked to productivity, connectivity of biological populations and phenomena such as coral bleaching and diseases. It provides a basis for applied research in wave prediction and offers test sites for hydrodynamic modelling. \n\nThe equipment comprises long-range WERA and medium-range WERA systems and long-range SeaSonde systems, and associated spares and transport infrastructure. An existing system that was installed by James Cook University in the Capricorn/Bunker region around Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef was integrated into the network. An HF radar acquisition by a consortium led by South Australian Research and Development Institute in South Australia was also integrated into the network.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

It is also important to note that an Incident Control Site whether it be a fixed or field ICC site can also be used as an Operations Point or Staging Area. DBCA does not purport that the information contained in this shapefile represents the only sites/all sites that are potentially available to be used as FFICC-Fixed Facility Incident Control Centre, FICCS- Field Incident Control Centre Sites.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is an extract for the Hunter subregion of the soil thickness data from the ASRIS Continental-scale soil property predictions 2001. The source data are the Surface of predicted Thickness of soil layer 1 (A Horizon - top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.  Data modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State and CSIRO and presented as .0.01 degree grid cells. \n\n\n\nThe dataset consists of statistics for soils depths (MIN, MAX, RANGE, MEAN, STD, MEDIAN) for each of the simulation catchments in the AWRA-L model. The soil thickness data were resampled to the model grid (BILO cells - 0.05 degree grid cells) and the catchments are defined by the BILO cells which fall within them. The gauging station ID in the spreadsheet defines the gauges which were used to define the upstream catchment area.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nUsed to define soils thickness in the AWRA-L model.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe soil thickness data were resampled to the model grid (BILO cells - 0.05 degree grid cells). Statistics for soils depths (MIN, MAX, RANGE, MEAN, STD, MEDIAN) for each of the simulation catchments in the AWRA-L model were calculated using the Zonal Statistics as Table tool within ArcGIS with the simulation catchments used as the zone dataset. The output table was used to populate the excel spreadsheet with the Station ID and catchments areas added.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) HUN AWRA-L ASRIS soil properties v01.

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 6.1 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia.  85 biogeographic regions and 405 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia.  \nThe IBRA Version 6.1 data consists of two datasets.  IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. \n\nIBRA Version 6.1 is the result of refinement of the IBRA Version 5.1 and version 6.0 boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories and also based on alterations by the states/territories along the state borders.  The refined boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies.  Those jurisdictions to refine their data in this version of IBRA include New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.  There are 53 newly named sub regions and 5 have been renamed from version 5.1.  Whilst there has been a refinement of sub-regional and associated bioregional boundaries in Qld, Vic and western NSW, the new sub-regions are found principally in eastern NSW.  In WA changes relate to moving the western boundary of Yalgoo bioregion to the coast, truncating the northern portion of the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion.\n\nNominal attributes that make up IBRA are: climate, lithology/geology, landform, vegetation, flora and fauna, and landuse.  The use of these attributes varies across the jurisdictions and for further information individual jurisdictions should be contacted.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.
