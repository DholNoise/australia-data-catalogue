    "description": "This dataset contains information from the 'Communication skills and general knowledge' domain of the Australian Early Development Censuses (AEDC) from 2009 - 2018. The data is based on modified 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

The data was collected from\nNovember 2004 to March 2005 by marine researchers at the\nTasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The shallow waters\nof the estuaries enabled the use of aerial photography and satellite\nimagery as one of the primary data sources, with habitats below the\ndepth range that imagery could detect determined with underwater\ncamera equipment, echo sounder data, and a Differential GPS unit,\nThis equipment was also used to field check the habitats determined\nfrom image interpretation. The dataset is intended to be used to\nfulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living\nMarine Resources Act 1995 and to support Natural Resource\nmanagement priorities in the Northern NRM region of Tasmania.",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2004.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The results provide land managers and researchers with a tool for reporting and monitoring spatial and temporal transformations of Australia’s native vegetated landscapes due to changes in land use and management practices. Following are the details about Big Scrub, Tintenbar site. \n\nPre-European benchmark-analogue vegetation: The site was originally lowland subtropical rainforest on basalt-derived and alluvial soils below 250&nbsp;m asl and further than 2&nbsp;km from the coast. \n\nBrief chronology of changes in land use and management:<ul>\n<li>1788: Indigenous land management - Goori people</li>\n<li>1823-25: Explorers Oxley followed by Rous traversed the area</li>\n<li>1842: Cedar getters ‘moved in’</li>\n<li>1870: Portion or survey plan prepared for the Tintenbar property</li>\n<li>1880: Camphor was planted as a shade tree in Lismore 1880s along streets</li>\n<li>1885: Brush had been largely selected and slightly cleared</li>\n<li>1900: Clearing done with brush hooks. Small trees were cut down with an axe and large trees were cut down using a cross-cut saw. Brush and fallen timber was burnt</li>\n<li>1900: Basalt rock removed from paddocks and placed around borders as field stone fencing, Paddock cleared of floaters so it could be ploughed</li>\n<li>1901: Aggressive pasture grasses established. Initially this was <em>Paspalum</em></li>\n<li>1901-1978: Dairying and pasture improvement - mainly Kikuyu and fertiliser added</li>\n<li>1968: Observed incursions of camphor in creeks and gullies but not removed or controlled</li>\n<li>1979: Changed from dairying to beef cattle production</li>\n<li>1980-87: Cattle removed - destocked</li>\n<li>1981-87: Observed incursions of weeds into the former dairy pasture including lantana, barna or elephant (<em>Pennisetum purpureum</em>) grass and tobacco bush and some camphor but not removed or controlled</li>\n<li>1988: Commenced agisting cattle</li>\n<li>1990-93: Agisted horses and cattle</li>\n<li>1993: Ceased agisting cattle and horses</li>\n<li>1994-2011: Dense stands of camphor left unchecked.</li>\n\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2005 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. \n\nExperiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. The series of experiments was run to assess which asymmetries between owner-floater contribute to the owner advantage. \n\nThe studies reveal that in Uca mjoebergi the OA is >90%. Floaters were found not to be poorer fighters, performing just as well as owners of the same size in standardised treatments. This meant that asymmetries other than fighting ability were contributing to the substantial OA. Mechanical advantage was found to be highly significant providing advantage to owners during fights. At low tide owners are more motivated than intruders based on their investment in territory. As the tide rolls in it was expected that floaters-owners experience motivational symmetry, however this was found not to reduce owner fighting success. In fact, when motivation was heightened to symmetric, owners won more contests. The effects of high quality territories on contests and owner motivation were weak. Although owners in high quality territories won more contests this was not a significant difference. The results also indicate there was a trend for owner fighting success to increase with an increase in the investment in neighbour relations.",

    "title": "WAMSI 2 - Kimberley Node - Project 1.3.1 - Reef Growth and Maintenance",
    "description": "The goal of this project was to gain a regional understanding of the geomorphology of the Kimberley coral reefs, including their interaction with different substrates, morphological patterns, distribution and relative exposure to terrestrial and other impacts. The most cost effective way to determine reef growth architecture is through shallow seismic surveys which will provide information on foundations, previous reef growth events and Holocene buildup, also providing site survey data for collection of Holocene cores. The Holocene reef record will be obtained by coring selected sites, to gain an understanding of sea levels and growth history responses, timing of events during the Holocene, reef building communities, resilience and climate change responses. This involved addressing the following:\n\nIn summary, our objectives were: \n\n- Use remote sensing with limited ground truth checking to establish the regional geomorphology, growth patterns and substrates of the inshore Kimberley reefs;\n- Determine the seismic architecture of selected Kimberley reefs as part of an assessment of Holocene reef growth and relation to antecedent foundations to assess reef growth;\n- Obtain a Holocene record of sea level change, reef building communities, chronology and growth patterns and climate history of selected inshore reefs for comparison with the short term record, where suitable coral material is obtained; \n- Where possible, quantify reef flat elevations, reef topography and morphology.\n\nPrior to commencement of acquisition of field data in 2013 time was invested in examining technical, equipment and logistic issues presented for SBP surveys and collection of coral reef cores for the remote and “tidally challenged” operational activities that will be required by this project. This is important also for site selection, which to some extent was dependent on other Kimberley project activities and priorities, and on ongoing discussions within WAMSI and with Industry groups. \n\nOre pit mapping fieldwork was undertaken on a Holocene reef exposed in a mining pit on Cockatoo Island in July 2013 and a paper published on the findings in Marine Geology in 2015. In October 2013 SBP fieldwork was successfully completed and analysis of the data completed. Collection of cores was completed in October 2014, where possible, in the same locations as the SBP, all cores were been logged and sampled and samples sent for dating, dating results for all reefs, except Adele Reef, have been received. The ‘ReefKIM’ database has mapped more than 800 reefs and 30 analysed in detail.\n\nData is stored at Pawsey Supercomputing Centre on 'WA Node Ocean Data Network' project under 'WAMSI2 > KMRP > 1.3 > 1.3.1'.  There are seven main folders:\n1) 000 Reports  2) 001 Metadata  3) 002 ReefKIM Database  4) 003 Reef Coring  5) 004 Cockatoo Island  6) 005 Seismic  7) 006 Papers.  Detail of folders is available via '1.3.1_Folder_Structure.pdf' which is attached to this metadata record.",

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\nJP - 2050 RCP 4.5 – Juvenile period as years until 50% of individuals in the population have \nflowered under future conditions (30-year period centred on 2050) with the RCP 4.5 emissions \nscenario based on a model featuring annual precipitation. (Fig 5 b) \nJP - 2× 2050 RCP 4.5 - Juvenile period as 2× years until 50% of individuals in the population have flowered under future conditions (30-year period centred on 2050) with the RCP 4.5 emissions \nscenario based on a model featuring annual precipitation.

The results show that with a stochastic environment an optimal-sized marine reserve can generate a triple payoff that (a), raises the resource rent even when harvesting is 'optimal', (b) decreases the recovery time for the biomass to return to its former state and smooths fishers' harvests and resource rents, and (c), lowers the chance of a catastrophic collapse following a negative shock.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth by caesarean section and had a general anaesthetic, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth by caesarean section and had a general anaesthetic, divided by the number of females who gave birth by caesarean section and recorded a non-missing value for general anaesthetic, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nCaesarean section is an operative procedure to remove the baby through an incision through the female's abdomen and uterus.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who gave birth through the vagina.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nData were not available for Victoria in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3 year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2013.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "This\ndataset contains a list of 200 plant species and their priority as appropriate\nthreatened species for planting in City of Melbourne green spaces. This is\nbased on a Threatened Species Assessment Tool developed by Royal Botanic\nGardens Victoria that was used to provide a framework to assess and prioritise\nthe inclusion of threatened species into landscape plantings. The tool includes\ninformation and scoring for cultivation requirements, conservation benefits and\nhorticultural potential which are the foundation of the assessment. Additional\nbenefits specific to the City of Melbourne and potential weed threat were also\nconsidered as part of the assessment process. Higher priority was given to\nspecies which are the most threatened and are indigenous to the City of\nMelbourne. \nFrom\nthis assessment process, a priority list of 56 species has been short-listed as\nappropriate threatened species for planting.   \nFor\ninclusion in the Threatened Species Assessment Tool, all species were required\nto be listed as threatened in Victoria. \nScores\nwere calculated based on the following:\n\n Cultivation\n     Requirements Subtotal = Cultivation Protocols + Propagation Protocols\n Conservation\n     Subtotal = Germplasm Source + Conservation Status + Germplasm Origin +\n     Provenance + Additional Conservation Benefit\n Total\n     Score = Cultivation Requirements Subtotal + Conservation Subtotal +\n     Additional Local Benefits Subtotal\n Total\n     Score including Horticultural Potential = Cultivation Requirements\n     Subtotal + Conservation Subtotal + Additional Local Benefits Subtotal +\n     Horticultural Potential \nThresholds\nwere set in certain categories which resulted in the removal of species from\npriority selection. Species with cells marked with an asterisk (*) were removed\nfrom the final priority plant list. In addition, an overall Total Score\nthreshold of 20 was chosen for final species selection. \n This\ndataset is based on the “City of Melbourne Threatened Plant Living Collection\nPlan” produced by R. Larke, M. Hirst and J. Arnott of the Royal Botanic Gardens\nVictoria, and N.S.G. Williams of the University of Melbourne. For documented\nmethods please refer to the report (attached).\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Darwin for 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "Building polygons were created in February 2013 by Geoscience Australia by manually digitising the\noutline of each building off the 2011 orthophotography.\nDigitisation was done from scratch off the 2011 orthophotography within Quantum GIS.\nUsing the ArcMap 'zonal statistics' tool the minimum, mean and maximum heights were\nfound for each building polygon from the 2011 digital elevation model and the 2011 digital\nsurface model (DSM). This information was then joined to the building polygon attribute\ntable. To find the building height from ground to roof, the difference between the Mean DSM\nand mean DEM was calculated and added as a field to the attribute table. To find the\nmaximum height of each building the difference between the Maximum DSM and Mean\nDEM was calculated. Polygon area, perimeter, and x and y coordinates of each building were\nalso attached as attributes.\nAccuracy is high as the layer was based on the 2011 orthophotography. Error may have been\nintroduced through the digitisation process. Building lean in the orthophotography may also\ncontribute to polygons which are slightly inaccurately placed.\nHeight attribute accuracy is inaccurate for building polygons which have tree cover above\nthem, as the tree elevation would influence the digital surface model. Particularly the\nMax_height field may include tree heights rather than building heights in some cases.\nAttribute accuracy could be improved by using the raw 2011 lidar data (.las files) which are\nclassified at 'buildings' to attach heights. This method was tested and was extremely time\nconsuming - only the height_max field was significantly improved.\nDisclaimer",

    "title": "Seabed environments and shallow geology of the Leveque Shelf, Browse Basin, Western Australia - Processed multichannel  sub bottom profiler data",
    "description": "Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Leveque Shelf (survey number SOL5754/GA0340), a sub-basin of the Browse Basin, in May 2013. This survey provides seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the Browse sedimentary basin. The basin, located on the Northwest Shelf, Western Australia, was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially suitable for CO2 storage. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The principal aim of the Leveque Shelf marine survey was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Leveque Shelf area that may extend to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research, combined with deeper geological studies undertaken concurrently, addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit, i.e. the basal sedimentary section (Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous), and the regional integrity of the Jamieson Formation (the seal unit overlying the main reservoir). This dataset comprises sparker sub bottom profiles processed as shallow, high resolution, multichannel seismic reflection data (SEG-Y format), navigation files (P190) and stacking velocities.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

A DALY combines the impact of dying early and living with illness.  \n</li>\n<li>\n\nIn 2018 the disease groups with the highest age standardised Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) rates for the ACT were cancer (27.5 per 1,000 population), mental and substance use disorders (26.4 per 1,000 population), musculoskeletal conditions (26.4 per 1,000) and cardiovascular diseases (20.5 per 1,000 population).\n</li>\n</ul>",

This dataset contains the locations of Snow petrel nests, mapped in the Mawson region during the 2004-2005 season. Location of nests were recorded with handheld Trimble Geoexplorer GPS receivers, differentially corrected and stored as an Arcview point shapefile (ESRI software).\r\n\r\nDescriptive information relating to each bird nest was recorded and a detailed description of the data fields is provided in the description of the shapefile (word document). A text file also provides the attribute information (formatted for input into R statistical software).\r\n\r\nThis work has been completed as part of ASAC project 2704 (ASAC_2704).\r\n\r\nFields recorded.\r\n\r\nSpecies\r\n\r\nActivity\r\n\r\nType\r\n\r\nEntrances\r\n\r\nSlope\r\n\r\nRemnants\r\n\r\nLatitude\r\n\r\nLongitude\r\n\r\nDate\r\n\r\nSnow\r\n\r\nEggchick\r\n\r\nCavitysize\r\n\r\nCavitydepth\r\n\r\nDistnn\r\n\r\nSubstrate\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nSitedotID\r\n\r\nAspect\r\n\r\nFirstfred",

    "description": "We propose an investigation of pulsars with interpulse (IP) emissions using the Ultra-wide-bandwidth Low (UWL) receiver at the Parkes (Murriyang) telescope. We aim to explore the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through the application of the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained across a wide bandwidth spanning 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. Emission heights will be measured using both the delay-radius and geometrical\n  methods to examine their frequency dependence and test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of different profile components will be conducted to constrain pulsar emission properties, while pulse intensity modulations will be analyzed to identify potential phase-lock phenomena. Our study will provide more information on the understanding of the properties of pulsars with IP emissions.",

The YNLHN provide health care access to approximately 77,000 people within the Yorke Peninsula, Southern Flinders and the Lower and Mid North areas of South Australia.\nWe consist of 16 regional hospitals, 6 community health sites, and 15 mixed state and commonwealth funded residential aged care facilities. The Yorke and Northern community have access to a wide range of health care services including emergency care, acute inpatient treatment, surgical, maternal and neonatal, renal dialysis, medium-low risk chemotherapy, residential aged care, outpatient services, and mental health services.\nAs from 1 July 2019, the State Government established 10 Local Health Networks (LHNs), each with its own Governing Board. From this date, six new regional LHNs replaced Country Health SA Local Health Network.

On an average night in the June quarter 2016, there were just over 900 young people in detention, over half of whom were unsentenced. Numbers and rates of young people in detention dropped slightly over the four years; however, this trend varied between different states and territories. Around half of all young people in detention on an average night were Indigenous. \r\n\r\nThe data set provided on data.gov.au contains data on young people in detention from June 2008 to June 2016. Some data may differ to the results published in Youth detention population in Australia 2016 due to data revisions.",

    "description": "Ground cover monitoring for Australia data was updated on the  MONITOR  website October 2014 (http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/monitor/Pages/default.aspx). The Department of Agriculture has invested in the application of satellite imagery to monitor ground cover for Australia. This is a collaborative partnership with CSIRO, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN), all states and the Northern Territory. This data update includes maps and charts of median bare soil, green and non-green vegetation for Australia from 2000 to 2014 by month, season and year. This information enables regular monitoring of ground cover to assess environmental targets, such as those for the National Landcare Program, relating to soil erosion and land management in Australia. \r\n\r\n The updated ground cover summary statistics and supporting metadata will also be available for download from the National Computational Infrastructure web page https://remote-sensing.nci.org.au/u39/public/html/modis/fractionalcover-metrics-abares/.

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Government Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere the recorded number of settlers is less than 5, the data has been set to null for confidentiality.\n\n\nSettlers which do not have a recorded LGA have been removed from the data.\n\n",

The aim is to develop a strategic approach to pest management that considers the complexity of ecological processes involved with establishment and spread and takes account of the values and assets in the region. The project will contribute to the management of invasive plants and animals by providing prioritisation tools that align with existing regional pest management frameworks.

    "description": "The earliest recorded geological work on the area covered by the Minilya four-mile sheet was that of Woodward (1907) who examined the country north of the Minilya River and noted the limestone on the west flank of the Giralia anticline. In 1909 A. Gibb Maitland described the Carboniferous and Permian succession in the area drained by the Gascoyne, Lyons, Minilya and Lyndon Rivers, but referred the whole sequence to the Carboniferous. Geologists of Oil Search Ltd., under D. Dale Condit, examined the Carnarvon Basin in 1932, 1934 and 1935. Raggatt (1936) described the stratigraphy of the Permian in some detail and subdivided the Cretaceous sequence. Raggatt and Fletcher (1937) examined the fauna of the Permian of the Carnarvon Basin. Teichert did detailed stratigraphic work in the Wandagee area from 1938 to 1940. Geologists of the Bureau of Mineral Resources mapped the Minilya Sheet from 1948 to 1951, using R.A.A.F. aerial photographs. The present sheet is entirely the result of the mapping of the Bureau geologists although much of the stratigraphic nomenclature is adapted from Raggatt's and Teichert's work.",

    "description": "The digital '1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia' is an update to the '1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia, 2016'. It comprises three layers: the primary 1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:500 000 State Cenozoic geology and the 1:500 000 State linear structures layer. The 1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology layer includes revised stratigraphy in the West Musgrave Province, West Arunta Orogen, East Pilbara, Capricorn Orogen, Eastern Capricorn basins and Murchison project areas; a new stratigraphic framework for the East Yilgarn project area is also included. The 1:500 000 State Cenozoic geology layer has no current updates from the 2016 revision. Compilation is based on published 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 Geological Series maps of Western Australia, together with GSWA and GA (AGSO, BMR) regional geological maps at scales from 1:250 000 to 1:1 000 000. Information from these maps has been modified locally, using geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and unpublished geological mapping. The Cenozoic layer overlies the pre-Cenozoic layer to depict Cenozoic paleovalleys and other areas of significant Cenozoic bedrock. The linear structures layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic structures and attribution of concealed structures refers to those that are older than the pre-Cenozoic unit in question.",

    "description": "‘System cash position’ is an estimate of the change in the aggregate level of Exchange Settlement (ES) balances at the RBA, prior to the RBA’s open market operations on that day. A negative value indicates a projected fall in the level of ES balances, while a positive value indicates a projected rise. The estimate is based on information about settlements arising from transactions by the RBA’s clients, including the Australian Government, as well as the RBA’s own transactions, and is announced at 9:30 am each trading day.\r\n\r\n‘Outright transactions’ is the cash value of purchases and sales, conducted as part of the Bank’s open market operations, of securities issued by the Australian Government and State and Territory central borrowing authorities with remaining terms to maturity up to around 18 months. A positive value indicates the RBA has purchased securities while a negative value indicates the RBA has sold securities.\r\n\r\n‘Foreign exchange swaps’ is the aggregate value of the first leg of foreign exchange swaps transacted for same-day value specifically for domestic liquidity management purposes. A positive value indicates the RBA has sold Australian dollars for foreign currency while a negative value indicates the RBA has purchased Australian dollars. The value of the second leg of a foreign exchange swap is captured in the ‘System cash position’ on the unwind date.\r\n\r\n‘Repurchase agreements (RPs)’ is the amount of the first leg of securities bought/sold by the RBA under repurchase agreement (RP). 'General Collateral' refers to eligible eligible securities issued by the Australian Government, State and Territory governments, supranational institutions, foreign governments and government agencies as well as eligible securities with a sovereign government guarantee. ‘Private securities’ covers all other eligible collateral, including ADI-issued securities (eligible bank-issued discount securities and certificates of deposit with 12 months or less to maturity and bonds issued by ADIs), asset-backed securities (eligible residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper) and eligible commercial paper. A positive value indicates the RBA has purchased securities under RPs while a negative value indicates the RBA has sold securities under RPs. It does not include RPs which are transacted through the RBA’s overnight RP facility. The value of the second leg of all RPs is captured in the ‘System cash position’ on the respective value dates.\r\n\r\n‘Exchange Settlement account balances (end day)’ is the aggregate of all ES balances held at the RBA at the close of business. Unexpected movements in ES balances and overnight RPs transacted through the RBA’s overnight RP facility mean that ‘Exchange Settlement account balances (end day)’ will not necessarily be the sum of the previous day’s ‘Exchange Settlement account balances (end day)’, the ‘System cash position’ and the total of ‘Open market operations’ transacted.\r\n\r\n‘Overnight repurchase agreements with RBA’ is the aggregate of the first leg of securities bought by the RBA through the overnight RP facility. These data are updated with a one month lag.\r\n\r\n## Outright Transaction Details\r\n\r\nThe 'Outright Transactions Details' sheet provides further information on the outright purchases and sales of Bonds and Discount Securities issued by the Australian Commonwealth, State & Territory Governments, conducted as part of the Bank's open market operations. “Issuer” is the acronym of the issuer of the bond/security.  A positive “Face value dealt” indicates a purchase while a negative value indicates a sale. 'Weighted average rate' is the average of the rates dealt for each bond/security, weighted by the amount transacted. 'Cut-off rate' is the lowest yield accepted.\r\n\r\n## Repo Details\r\n\r\nThe Repo Details sheets provide a summary of the type of securities delivered to/by the RBA under RP at each term dealt through the open market operations. 'Govt and Quasi-Govt Repo Details' covers repo against General Collateral (eligible securities issued by the Australian Government, State and Territory governments, supranational institutions, foreign governments and government agencies as well as eligible securities with a sovereign government guarantee). ‘Private securities’ covers all other eligible collateral, including ADI-issued securities (eligible bank-issued discount securities and certificates of deposit with 12 months or less to maturity and bonds issued by ADIs), asset-backed securities (eligible residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper) and eligible commercial paper.\r\n\r\n'Term' is the number of days dealt in open market operations.\r\n\r\n'Value Dealt' is the amount of the first leg of securities bought/sold by the RBA under RP.\r\n\r\nWeighted average rate' is the is the average of the rates on RPs dealt by the RBA through open market operations, weighted by the amount transacted.\r\n\r\n'Cut-off rate' is the lowest rate dealt by the RBA through open market operations for each term dealt.\r\n\r\n## Repo Unwinds\r\n\r\nThe Repos Unwinds sheet provides a summary of the value of repurchase agreements due to unwind in the future, for both General Collateral and Private Securities. The unwind amount is equal to the sum of the total value dealt to that date plus accrued interest.  \r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Tricyclic and tetracyclic terpane ratios are used as biomarker proxies for depositional environments and to classify crude oils and source rocks. However, the biological precursors and diagenetic drivers of these proxies are not well understood. This study reports on the discovery of tricyclic and tetracyclic breakdown products of pentacyclic hopanoids that co-elute with 14α-C19 and βα-C20–C22 cheilanthanes and C24 tetracyclic terpane in gas chromatograms. This includes hopanoid breakdown products (HBPs) that are identical to 14α-C19 cheilanthane and C24 tetracyclic terpane, biomarkers that are commonly used as indicators of terrigenous organic matter in source rocks and their derived hydrocarbon products. These HBPs were generated by pyrolysis of C30 diplopterol, a common compound found in the cell membranes of almost all hopanoid-producing bacteria, some lichens and higher plants. HBPs are common in rock-extracted bitumens and crude oils from the Neoproterozoic to the Cenozoic and across a wide range of thermal maturities. Comparison of the relative abundance of HBPs and cheilanthanes against commonly used tricyclic and tetracyclic terpane parameters shows that HBPs can drive or strongly influence terpane-based paleoenvironmental proxies. This study begins to rationalise why some of these parameters indicate specific depositional environments and proposes new ratios that quantify the impact of HBPs on biomarker proxies.\n\n<b>Citation:</b> Liyanage, T., van Maldegem, L.M., Hope, J., Schaeffer, P., Adam, P., Nytoft, H.P., Edwards, D. &amp; Brocks, J., 2025.

    "title": "The role of copper in facilitating the invasion of sessile marine invertebrate communities by pests: effects of copper pulse frequency in established assemblages",
    "description": "Disturbance events are thought to provide an opportunity for the colonisation and establishment of invasive species.  Contamination of coastal waters with copper from sewage outfall and antifouling paints may create a disturbance that favours the establishment of introduced sessile invertebrates.  This study examines if the frequency of experimentally applied doses of copper sulfate increases the abundance of introduced sessile invertebrate species within developing (2-weeks old) and established (9-months old) assemblages.  Responses to regular and irregularly applied doses of copper were also tested in developing assemblages. \n\nThis dataset gives the effects of copper pulse frequency on the number of native and introduced taxa within established (9 month-old) sessile invertebrate assemblages.  Experimental manipulations were carried out in Port Phillip Bay at Workshops Jetty, Williamstown, Victoria over a 10 week period between October and December 2004.  Nine-month old sessile invertebrate assemblages established on Perspex plates were subjected to three treatments: an undosed control, or copper pulses applied every 2 or 4 weeks.",

Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Civic in ACT with SA2 code 801051053, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This research addressed seagrass, macroalgal and microalgal abundance, biomass and productivity for the Sunday Island Group (in the Buccaneer Archipelago, Western Australia) and also assessed rates of herbivory on seagrass. The main aim was to understand the role of benthic primary producers in the macrotidal fringing reef and terraced lagoon environments which characterize the Sunday Island Group and are common throughout the Kimberley.\nOur study was focused on the islands and coastline of the Bardi Jawi Indigenous Protected Area (IPA), encompassing Cygnet Bay, One Arm Point, Jalan (Tallon Island) and Iwany (Sunday Island).  Five surveys were conducted between November 2013 to November 2015, with three surveys occurring just prior to the wet season (November 2013, October 2014 and October-November 2015) and two surveys just after the wet season (March 2014 and April 2015).\nThis metadata specifically refers to bacteria production data from soft sediment and ECU derived data from Christin Sawstrom.  \nThe related CSIRO Marlin record is: http://www.marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/search#!2f5065eb-0aa1-32ba-e053-08114f8c742d",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.7) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nWombat State Forest site is a secondary re-growth forest that was last harvested in 1980. Dominant tree species are <em>Eucalyptus obliqua</em> (messmate stringybark), <em>Eucalyptus radiata</em> (narrow leaf peppermint) and <em>Eucalyptus rubida</em> (candlebark) with an average canopy height of 25&nbsp;m. The understorey consists mainly of patchy grasses and the soil is a silty-clay overlying clay. The forest is managed by the Department of Sustainability and Environment and management includes selective harvesting and prescribed burning regimes. The climate of the study area is classified as cool-temperate to Mediterranean with cold and wet winters (May-August) and warm and dry summers (December-February) with temperatures between 1 and 30&nbsp;°C and mean annual air temperature of 12.1&nbsp;°C. Annual rainfall is approximately 871&nbsp;mm (142 year long-term average). Coherent automated measurements of soil greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4 and N2O) were collected using a trailer-mounted mobile laboratory - Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrometer from 2010 to 2016. Measurement height was originally 30&nbsp;m but increased to 33&nbsp;m in January 2017.",

Determine the distribution and status of inshore dolphins in the northern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) by identifying likely important habitats based on collaboration with Tradition Owners and published information, then conduct line transect surveys (along with biopsy samples) in the Cardwell area (Girringun) and Bathurst Bay (far northern GBR).\n\n2. Perform aerial surveys of Dugongs from the region from the southern boundary of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) to Cooktown (2011/2012) and from Cooktown north in late 2013. \n\n3. Perform at least two field trips per year between 2011 and 2014 to collect samples of skin (turtle and dugong), feces (dugong) and marine flora (seagrass, algae and mangrove species) to examine foraging dynamics and ecosystem role of green turtles and dugongs in algal and seagrass based ecosystems of the GBRWHA (coastal zone from Bowen to Cardwell).  \n\n4. The project will also work with Traditional Owners to improve conservation of these species of conservation concern and high cultural value.",

    "description": "CSIRO Bioclimatic Ecosystem Resilience Index (BERI v2) is a global 30 arc-second product for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. BERI measures the capacity of natural ecosystems to retain species diversity in the face of climate change, as a function of ecosystem area, connectivity and integrity. The indicator assesses the extent to which any given spatial configuration of natural habitat across a landscape will promote or hinder climate-induced shifts in biological distributions. It does this by analyzing the functional connectivity of each grid-cell of natural habitat to areas of habitat in the surrounding landscape which are projected to support a similar assemblage of species under climate change to that currently associated with the cell of interest. The indicator can then be aggregated and reported by any desired spatial unit – e.g. an ecosystem type, a country, or the entire planet.  \n\nThe BERI can be used to monitor and report past-to-present trends in the capacity of ecosystems to retain species diversity in the face of ongoing climate change by repeatedly recalculating the indicator using best-available mapping of ecosystem condition or integrity observed at multiple points in time, e.g. for different years. It can also serve as a leading indicator for assessing the contribution that proposed or implemented area-based actions are expected to make to enhancing the present capacity of ecosystems to retain species diversity, thereby providing a foundation for strategic prioritisation of such actions by countries.  \n\nAggregation of the raw data for reporting by a region (country, ecoregion etc.) should follow the procedure in the folder \" Calculating weighted geometric means of CSIRO BILBI indicators for a region.\" An example R script provided in the same folder can be used to perform these calculations.

    "description": "By notice in the Government Gazette on 26 October 2000, twelve new wards were established in March 2001, with one Councillor to be elected to represent each ward. \r\n\r\nA further review took place in 2008, and although ward boundaries were modified the structure remained the same. This structure came into effect at the November 2008 election as a result of an electoral representation review conducted in 2008. For more information about the review, visit the Greater Geelong City Council representation review page https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Reviews/geelongrr.html\r\n\r\nUse this layer to search geographically by Ward, Councillor, or Portfolio; or enquire on the area measurement (sq km) for each ward.\r\n\r\nAlthough all due care has been taken to ensure that these data are correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by the City of Greater Geelong in their use.\r\nGeographic Coordinate System: GCS_WGS_1984.",

    "description": "The introduced European polychaete Sabella spallanzanii has become a dominant feature of sub-tidal habitats in south-eastern Australia.  This study examines the physical effects of  Sabella spallanzanii on macrofaunal assembleges of soft sediments.  Macrofaunal  assemblages  were compared in the presence and absence of real and mimic S. spallanzanni clumps within sub-tidal experimental plots at Clifton Springs, Bellarine Peninsula, Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. The effects of S. spallanzanii on:  i) existing macrofaunal assemblage; ii) distribution of larvae and iii) colonisation of macrofauna were tested.     This dataset gives the colonisation of macrofauna in trays of sediments which had been defaunated and embedded in sediments within  plots of   undisturbed sediment (Control)  and  plots that  contained a single clump of  15 S. spallanzanii individuals (Sabella).  Sediment trays were colonised predominantly by crustaceans, representing 91% of all individuals found.  The presence of Sabella clumps resulted in a significantly higher colonisation of Cylindroleberidid ostracods, but no other effects were detected.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Sydney Metropolitan Western Study Area Hydrogeological Landscapes: March 2011 (First Edition)",
    "description": "The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for the understanding of how salinity manifests itself in the landscape and how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially defines areas of similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of HGL determination relies on the integration of a number of factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith depth, and climate; an understanding of the differences in salinity development; and the impacts (land salinity/salt load/water electrical conductivity) in landscapes. Information sources such as soils maps, site characterisation, salinity site mapping, hydrogeological conditions and surface and groundwater data are combined to develop standard templates for each HGL. The focus of this package is the Sydney Metropolitan Western Study Area. It comprises four volumes - Volume 1: project background, regional setting, methodologies, interpretations, conclusions, glossary and references; Volume 2: HGL templates, and information associated with the use of the HGL templates; Volume 3: maps and digital spatial data developed for the project, including derivative maps to assist in land management decision making; and Volume 4: background information relevant to land management for rural and urban salinity in the Sydney Metropolitan Western Study Area. This includes information on salinity management from the perspectives of land use design, scales and types of management, landscape function, management strategies, actions and outcomes, as well as land use to be avoided.\n\nSpatial resolution for this product is 1:100 000.",

    "description": "This data was collected in August 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V03.\r\n\r\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, Aug 01, 2011\r\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, Aug 10, 2011\r\n\r\nCO2 System Overview:\r\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \r\n\r\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\r\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \r\n\r\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "title": "Asset database for the Arckaringa subregion on 07 August 2015",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nAsset Database v3 in Arckaringa subregions supersedes previous versions:\n\n(1) Updated the database for M2 test results provided from ARC assessment team and created the draft BA-LEB-ARC-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150807.xlsx \n\n(2) updated the group, subgroup, class and depth for (up to) 141 NRM WAIT assets to cooperate the feedback to OWS from relevant SA NRM regional office (whose staff missed the asset workshop). The AIDs and names of those assets are listed in table LUT_changed_asset_class_20150807 in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb\n\n (3) As a result of (2), added three new assets separated from three exiting assets. Those assets and their parents are listed in table LUT_ADD_3_asstes_20150807 in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb. The M2 and M3 test results for those 3 assets are inherited from their parents in this version\n\n(4) Four assets' names from RNE data source were changed for confidential reason and they are listed in table LUT_changed_RNE_20150807 in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb\n\n(5) Added Appendix C in ARC_asset_database_doc_201500807.doc is about total elements/assets in current Group and subgroup\n\n(6)Added Four SQL queries (Find_All_Used_Assets, Find_All_WD_Assets, Find_Amount_Asset_in_Class  and Find_Amount_Elements_in_Class) in ARC_asset_database_20150807.mdb for total assets and total numbers\n\n(7)The databases, especially spatial   database (ARC_asset_database_20150807Only.gdb), were changed such as duplicated attribute fields in spatial data were removed and only ID field is kept. The user needs to join the Table Assetlist or Elementlist  to the relevant spatial data.\n\n\n\nThe Asset database is registered to the BA repository as an ESRI personal goedatabase (.mdb - doubling as a MS Access database) that can store, query, and manage non-spatial data while the spatial data is in a separate file geodatabase joined by AID/ElementID.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Arckaringa are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Arckaringa subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. \n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"ARC_asset_database_doc_20150807.doc \", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"ARC_asset_database_doc_20150807.doc\" located in the zip file.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate\tNotes\n\n1.0\t17/03/2015\tInitial database\n\n1.1\t19/03/2015\tAdd SA point Eco data ( 2 assets and 67 Elements) and fix  some AIDs  in table AssetDecisions\n\n2\t16/04/2015\tremove 6 elements ('NGIS_Bore_HydroID_30020907','NGIS_Bore_HydroID_30020908','NGIS_Bore_HydroID_30020921','Unit No 633800074_South Australian Arid Lands_56231','Unit No 633800075_South Australian Arid Lands_56239','Unit No 633900013_South Australian Arid Lands_56243')  from relevant tables  and reprocess  two assets with AIDs 17632 and 17648 without above 3 elements for each, base on SA state information after asset community workshop\n\n3\t7/08/2015\t(1) Updated the database for M2 test results provided from ARC assessment team and created the draft BA-LEB-ARC-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150807.xlsx \n\n(2) updated the group, subgroup, class and depth for (up to) 141 NRM WAIT assets to cooperate the feedback to OWS from relevant SA NRM regional office (whose staff missed the asset workshop).

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Melbourne) with SA2 code (21122).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Melbourne SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

    "description": "The attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student days attended by full-time school students in Years 1–10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended.\nData Notes:\n\n\nAttendance data for NSW government schools only. The attendance rate is calculated as (1 minus absences divided by enrolled days) multiplied by 100.\n\n\nThis data includes the student attendance rate for semester 1, semester 2 and the full year.\n\n\nStudents were learning from home for extended periods during Semester 2 2021 due to COVID-19. As a result, attendance rates for Semester 2 and full year are not reliable and have not been published.\n\n\n2020 data is not provided because students were encouraged to learn from home for several weeks in Semester 1. \n\n\nFor more detail on how attendance data for 2020 and 2021 were affected by COVID-19, please refer to CESE factsheets: ‘Effects of COVID-19 on attendance during Semester 1 2020’ and ‘2021 Semester 1 student attendance'.\n\n\n\n\nAll students in Years 1 to 10 in NSW government schools are regarded as full-time.\n\n\nKindergarten, Year 11, Year 12 students have been excluded in the attendance rates. \n\n\nUngraded (support) student attendance rates are included as a separate row and excluded from Primary and Secondary totals. Ungraded students in NSW government schools are classified as either primary or secondary according to their level of education.\n\n\nDistance education and Schools for Special Purposes’ attendance data is not currently collected.\n\n\nBushfires affected many schools' attendance in Term 4 2019 and should be taken into account when comparing Semester 2 data to other years. \n\n\nPrior to 2018 absences equalled ‘all full day absences for the period in question’. \n\n\nFrom 2020, students in mainstream support classes are reported by their underlying grade of enrolment. Students in schools for specific purposes (SSPs) are included as 'ungraded'.\n\n\nIn 2021 attendance figures were calculated differently to align with the third edition of ACARA’s National Standards for Student Attendance Data and Reporting. As a result, data is not directly comparable to previous years.\n\n\nThe Department implemented an automated attendance feed (AAF) system in Semester 1 2021. The AAF has significantly improved data quality in 2021, which has affected data comparability with previous years.\n\n\n** Note** \nIn 2018, NSW government schools implemented the national standards for student attendance data reporting. This resulted in a fall in attendance rates for most schools due to the inclusion of partial absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation. Data for 2018 is not directly comparable with earlier years.\nSource:\n\nEducation Statistics and Measurement. Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

The ASGS ensures that these statistics are comparable and geospatially integrated and provides users with a coherent set of standard regions so that they can access, visualise, analyse and understand statistics.The 2016 ASGS will be used for the 2016 Census of Population and Housing and progressively introduced into other ABS data collections. The ABS encourages the use of the ASGS by other organisations to improve the comparability and usefulness of statistics generally, and in analysis and visualisation of statistical and other data.The ABS Structures are a hierarchy of regions developed for the release of ABS statistical information. The main components are as follows:<ul><li>Statistical Areas Level 1</li><li>Statistical Areas Level 2</li><li>Statistical Areas Level 3</li><li>Statistical Areas Level 4</li><li>Regional Boundaries (Local Government Area, Suburb)</li></ul>The Australian Bureau of Statistics Geographical Standard Boundaries - Statistical Areas are used to define geographical areas to support statistical and socio-economic analysis at a state and regional scale. They are useful for analytical purposes within statistical boundaries through the aggregation of a wide swath of data and information.The ABS maintains the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) and the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) for pre-2011 census information.In addition to the NSW Administrative Boundaries Theme Australian Bureau of Statistics also provides this data via a web service direct from ABS.Further standards, specifications and classifications can be found at:<a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards\">Australian Bureau of Statistics Standards</a><a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications\">Australian Bureau of Statistics Classifications</a>The regions defined in the ABS Structures will not change until the next Census in 2021. The Non-ABS Structures are updated only when the ABS considers that there are major changes to the administrative boundaries they represent.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceAPIFile TypeMap Feature ServiceAttribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m.

    "description": "This dataset contains topographic relief data from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Land use zoning in an LEP are grouped into the following broad categories: BUSINESS (B), ENVIRONMENT (E), INDUSTRIAL (IN), RESIDENTIAL (R), RECREATION (RE), RURAL (RU), SPECIAL (SP) and WATERWAYS (W). The LZN dataset shows the zoning of all areas designated under the LEP. Zones define the legally permitted and prohibited uses of a piece of land, determining if a lot can be used for commercial, industrial, residential or other purposes. In other words, it defines what can and cannot be built on a piece of land. The is a revision of the original 2006 dataset, metadata date 5 July 2016.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset.\n The Land Application data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB. The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

    "description": "This dataset quantifies cumulative monthly solar irradiance totals for building footprints in Kalgoorlie-Boulder, providing monthly and annual energy budgets essential for photovoltaic system sizing and economic analysis.\n\nDerived from hourly simulations aggregated to monthly totals, the dataset delivers cumulative irradiance values (W/m²) for each of 12 months plus annual totals across approximately 16,000 buildings. This format directly supports PV system performance modelling, return-on-investment calculations, and comparative analysis of seasonal energy availability across different urban areas.\n\nThe data combines Microsoft Bing 2D building geometries with validated climate datasets and Radiance-based solar simulation. Monthly cumulation allows users to assess seasonal energy production patterns, identify optimal installation timeframes, and estimate annual yield without managing high-temporal-resolution data files.\n\nKey applications include renewable energy target setting for local government, preliminary system sizing for commercial solar installations, and academic research into urban energy self-sufficiency potential. Energy utilities and planners can use monthly totals to model distributed generation contributions to grid supply across different seasons.\n\nValues assume flat rooftop surfaces without accounting for actual roof pitch, azimuth, or shading effects. Users requiring panel-specific calculations should apply the irradiance values to their chosen panel specifications using standard photovoltaic performance models. For sub-monthly temporal dynamics, see the hourly potential dataset.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "Geoscience Australia’s Exploring for the Future (EFTF) program aims to enhance decision-making on Australia's mineral, energy, and groundwater resources by providing comprehensive geoscience data. Launched in 2016 with a $225m investment, the program has spawned various national projects, including the Australia's Resources Framework (ARF). The ARF focuses on a national perspective of Australia's surface and subsurface geology, supporting economic and social benefits, including transition to net-zero emissions.\n\nOne key sub-project within EFTF is the Geochemistry for Basin Prospectivity (G4BP) module. It explores Australian basins for basin-hosted base metal systems. The current focus (2020-2024) is on the Stuart Shelf region in South Australia, in collaboration with the Geological Survey of South Australia (GSSA) and CSIRO. The efforts aim to refine our understanding of sediment-hosted copper-cobalt-silver (Cu-Co-Ag) potential in this area.\n\nThis work has two primary objectives:\n\nGeochemical fingerprinting and baseline data collection: Comprehensive data collection and reanalysis of existing samples aim to establish baseline geochemistry for stratigraphic units.\nMineral system components: Identification of potential metal sources, fluid sources, and trap rocks using a mineral systems approach.\n\nThis data release forms the second stage release of new geochemical data for the Stuart Shelf region; the first stage release was detailed in Champion et al. (2023b). There is also an earlier data release (Champion et al., 2023a) featuring reanalysis, by modern analytical methods, of legacy mineralised and/or altered Stuart Shelf and underlying basement samples held at Geoscience Australia.",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This service is designed to provide access to the full State Remotely Sensed Image Library collection of aerial imagery captured under the Spatial Imagery Services Program (SISP). This service includes the latest available high resolution aerial imagery. The service is dynamic and can be used to filter and display individual aerial photo projects. The projects range from 2cm to 50cm resolution. Accuracy is dependent on the individual projects. Periodical updates will be made to the service as new projects are captured. Projects are visible at scales 1:50,000, 1:250,000 and 1:500,000. The aerial photos comprised in each of the projects are orthorectified which removes the effects of image perspective (tilt) and relief (terrain) effects for the purpose of creating a planimetrically correct image. The resultant orthorectified images have a constant scale wherein features are represented in their “true” positions. This service supports projects captured in both GDA94 and GDA2020 datums. A Seven parameter similarity transformation has been applied to new projects that have been captured in GDA2020, this is to ensure that they align and display correctly when published in the default WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) projection alongside GDA94 projects. If you would like to receive updates for new projects, functionality or planned downtime please subscribe here: http://ems.gs/3qln0ijbKGR.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Adelaide in SA with SA2 code 401011001, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "Spatial data of the boundaries of Australia's declared World Heritage properties as at 30/06/2016. \nThere are currently twenty (20) Australian properties on the World Heritage List (as of August 2011). The Great Barrier Reef, the Tasmanian Wilderness, the Wet Tropics of Queensland and Shark Bay meet all four World Heritage criteria for natural heritage, with Kakadu National Park, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Willandra Lakes Region and the Tasmanian Wilderness being listed for both natural and cultural criteria. The Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Naracoorte/Riversleigh), Lord Howe Island Group, Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, Fraser Island, Macquarie Island, Heard and McDonald Islands, the Greater Blue Mountains Area and Purnululu National Park are listed under the World Heritage criteria for natural heritage. The Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens, Melbourne were inscribed in the World Heritage List against Cultural criterion (ii): exhibit an important interchange of human values over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town planning or landscape design. The Sydney Opera House was inscribed in the World Heritage List in 2007 against Cultural criterion (i) (see whc.unesco.org.) The Australian Convict Sites were inscribed on the World Heritage List on 31 July 2010. There are 11 sites that make up the World Heritage Australian Convict Sites against Cultural criterion (iv) and (vi). The Ningaloo Coast was inscribed on the World Heritage List in June 2011 against Natural criteria (vii) and (x). \nA single Australian World Heritage Areas database has been created by combining data which was historically stored as a separate set of data for each property. The coastline of Queensland was produced under specific contract for Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) by the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (AUSLIG) in 1984. Originally engineered by AUSLIG from datasets produced by the Division of National Mapping and RAN Hydrographic Service; Queensland coastal information produced by AUSLIG at 250k scale with 100k elements from developing technology at the time of genesis; Island information is specific to the Great Barrier Reef Region as produced from RAN Hydrographic Service data at 100k scale. Updated against satellite imagery during the RAP process (2003-2004) to 25k scale, especially in Cairns, Whitsundays and Hinchinbrook Regions. This coastline is used to represent the coastal boundary of the Great Barrier Reef WHA, and is supplied by GBRMPA Spatial Data Centre. \nFor more information use the following link: Australian Government Data Portal.",
