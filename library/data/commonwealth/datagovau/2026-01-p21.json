    "description": "This report provides a description of the activities completed during the Outer Darwin Harbour Mapping Survey, from 28 May and 23 June 2015 on the RV Solander (Survey GA0351/SOL6187). This survey was undertaken as a collaboration between Geoscience Australia (GA), the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Department of Land Resource Management (Northern Territory Government) and was funded through the INPEX Offset Habitat Mapping Program for the Darwin Harbour region. The intent of this four year (2014-2018) program is to improve knowledge of the marine environments in the Darwin and Bynoe Harbour regions by collating and collecting baseline data that enable the creation of thematic habitat maps that underpin marine resource management decisions. The specific objectives of survey GA0351/SOL6187 were to:\n\n1.\tObtain high resolution geophysical (bathymetry) data for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay;\n2.\tCharacterise substrates (acoustic backscatter properties, grainsize, sediment chemistry) for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay; and \n3.\tCollect tidal data for the survey area.\n\nData acquired during the survey included: 720 km2 multibeam sonar bathymetry and acoustic backscatter; 96 sampling stations collecting seabed sediments, underwater photography and video imagery and oceanographic information including tidal data and 54 sound velocity profiles.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Fourtytwo sources have been discovered in targeted observations of Fermi unidentified point sources, two towards Supernova Remnants, 19 in the Magellanic Clouds, 105 in Globular Clusters and 81 in a survey of the Galactic plane. A large fraction of the new discoveries are recycled pulsars (including a few relativistic systems and several 'spider' binaries), or young pulsars. Timing observations have an essential role in exploiting the full potential of any pulsar discovery, allowing for the precise measurement of rotational, astrometric and orbital parameters which, in turn, give us powerful tools to improve our understanding of the physics in extreme environments as well as of the population of neutron stars as a whole. The UWL receiver of the Parkes telescope is a sensitive, versatile instrument that is allowing us to successfully time these new sources, in the bright-end of TRAPUM discoveries.",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Achieving an efficient allocation of fishery resource stocks between commercial and recreational fishers is often hampered by incomplete information about the economic value of these fisheries to the community. Economic data for Australia's recreational fishing sector are currently not readily available in a form that can be used for resource allocation decisions. The little data that are available provide a limited picture of the economic value of the sector. This is largely due to the non-market nature of goods produced by recreational fishing. \r\n\r\n This paper provides a theoretical framework for how non-market values associated with recreational fishing can be derived using the travel cost method. It then combines this with economic information from the commercial sector to assess the effect of changes in allocation of a fish stock between recreational and commercial fishers. The framework assumes that the commercial and recreational catch is regulated via a total allowable catch. The paper also highlights some of the impediments of using this framework in applied analysis. The description of the travel cost method in a recreational fishing context is supported by a summary of some recent work undertaken by ABARES in valuing game fishing activities in eastern Australia. \r\n",

Captured by digitizing a line along the centre of a linear geographic feature. Includes the waterway name, a unique asset identifier, EPMS/asset section number (to link the object to associated drawings) and key attributes to assist with its intended purpose. When used in conjunction with the constructed waterways centreline and waterway connector centreline layers, this layer completes the waterway/hydrology linear network (complete centreline) for Melbourne Water’s non-underground drainage assets. Data set is used to indicate the location and types of natural waterways for asset management and maintenance works, to assess buildover or planning applications, for waterway rehabilitation works and flow management (helping maintain the flow of water and reduce the impacts of floods), ongoing condition monitoring and hydrologic modelling and analysis and to assist with the planning and design, construction of new waterway corridors, stormwater management (WSUD) options.Waterway (Reach) layer created from original FIS 1:50K (Vicmap Hydro) streams data set which included only those waterways within catchments of greater than 60ha. Waterways (Reach) Rectification project undertaken 2001 to 2003 to review and correct the extent of the waterways reach network to ensure a complete data set exists (using the Drainage Metropolis Boundary, 50K data, 1:2500 Drainage Record Plans, Drainage Limits data, orthophotos, as constructed and/or design drawings, contour data and Melway Street Directory). Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in GIS and AMIS for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for start / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length that are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated in 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10 using Lidar survey data (contours). Data is maintained using Lidar survey data (contours) and 60 ha limits.

    "description": "Sediment traps (IMOS platform code:SAZOTS) are cones which intercept and store falling marine particles in collection cups. The particles consist of a range of material including phytoplankton, zooplankton, faecal pellets, and dust. Each trap collects a time series of samples. The sediment traps are from deep moorings in the Southern Ocean, typically at 47S, 54S, and 61S and at around 140 degrees East. Each mooring typically has 2-3 traps between 800m and 3800m below sea-level.\n\nThe samples are size fractionated into <1mm and >1mm fractions using a 1mm sieve. Various chemical analyses and observations have been made on the <1mm fraction. Analysis methods are described in the attached document \"SAZ PROJECT MOORED SEDIMENT TRAPS: RESULTS OF THE 1997-1998 DEPLOYMENTS\".\n\nPhotographs of the >1mm fraction from 1998 to 2012 are available here for download. After processing, data from IMOS deployments will be made available.\n\nPreliminary biogeochemical data for the sediment traps on the 2008/09 mooring are available. These preliminary data are indicative only and have not been quality controlled. Analysis of the samples is ongoing. A full dataset for this sediment trap deployment will be made available through the IMOS Ocean Portal when analysis is complete.",

    "description": "This dataset contains status, location and directional information for each pedestrian sensor device installed throughout the city.  The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with related datasets. \nSince the inauguration of the Pedestrian Counting System in 2009, some sensor devices have been removed or relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works. Others may be inactive due to a temporary issue. This is detailed in the notes column.  Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.\nSensors are typically installed under an awning or on a street pole to form a counting zone on the footpath below. They record bi-directional pedestrian movements through the zone, 24 hours, every day. Locations are selected based on three criteria – retail and event activity, regular pedestrian use and the egress and entry flow to these areas. The system records movements, not images, so no individual information is collected.  New sensor devices have been recently installed, with more to come in the near future as part of the city’s commitment to expanding the system. \nStatus field:\nThis field indicates if the sensor is expected to be active and is manually maintained as needed. A pedestrian sensor with an active value ('A') may be unavailable in some situations. \nA representation of pedestrian volume which compares each location on any given day and time can be found in our Online Visualisation.Related datasets: Pedestrian Counting System – 2009 to Present (counts per hour)Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)",

Read the complete annual report https://www.psba.qld.gov.au/publications/annualReport/Pages/default.aspx\nNote:\nOn 7 September 2020, the Queensland Government announced its intention to integrate the PSBA functions and staff into the public safety agencies of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES), as part of a wider strategy to structurally reform government statutory bodies and agencies and increase further efficiencies in the delivery of quality outcomes to Queensland communities. \nOn 27 May 2021, the Queensland Parliament passed the Debt Reduction and Savings Bill which repealed the Public Safety Business Agency Act 2014, resulting in the PSBA being abolished from 1 July 2021.\nThe disestablishment of the PSBA and the corresponding functional transition into the QPS and QFES, as per the Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 2) 2021 (AAO), was completed by 30 June 2021.\nDue to the disestablishment of the PSBA, all Open Data records within the Queensland Open Data Portal relating to the PSBA have been migrated to QPS.\nFor enquires or further information about the PSBA, please contact the QPS or QFES using the comments section or the contact us page.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of tobacco use, alcohol risk and recent illicit drug use for people aged 14 years and over. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS). The NDSHS is the leading survey of licit and illicit drug use in Australia. The 2016 survey was the 12th conducted under the auspices of the NDS. Previous surveys were conducted in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013. The data collected through these surveys have contributed to the development of policies for Australia's response to drug-related issues.\nThe NDSHS data accompanies the National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016: Detailed Findings Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016 Data Tables.\n\n\nNational Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016 - Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe calculation of alcohol risk was updated in 2013. 'Abstainers' no longer equate to 'never' and 'ex-drinkers' combined because the calculation now excludes drinkers who did not indicate the quantity of alcohol they consumed. Trend data will not match the data presented in previous reports. Refer to technical notes for further details.\n\n\nRecent illicit drug use is defined as illicit drug use in the previous 12 months.\n\n",

    "description": "Since the 1980s the managers of alpine resorts have collected information on visitation numbers.  Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and covers most of the suburbs of Chullora and Potts\nHill and small parts of the suburbs of Yagoona, Greenacre and Bankstown. It is an urban catchment\nthat drains through a stormwater pipe network and Freshwater Creek in a north-easterly direction to\nthe Cooks River. The catchment is bounded by the Hume Highway to the south and east, and the\nrailway line to the north. The Rookwood Road catchment is wholly within the Bankstown City local\ngovernment area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 550 stormwater pits and 680 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Rookwood Road Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is\nincluded as Appendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix C.\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the subsequent Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1989. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "The Polynya2 (Mertz region) deepwater mooring was deployed on 2011-01-22 at (-66.20 S, 143.21 E) off the Adelie Land Coast in Antarctica, and was recovered in January 2015. In February 2014 a second array was deployed in a new location near the Totten Glacier.\n\nInstrumentation includes 75kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (RDI longranger ADCPs), Seabird SBE37s (SM and SMP) and 16plus V2.\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurement at four depth on each mooring, between the seafloor and 300m depth (the mooring are limited to this depth to avoid contact with icebergs).\n\nThis Polynya mooring array will re-continue the time series of bottom water export begun in 2008, using observation strategy, modified as required following recovery of the array in 2009.\n\nThe aim of the IMOS Polynya mooring array is to measure the export of dense Antarctic Bottom Water from the Adélie Land coast. Sinking of dense water near Antarctica supplies the deep branch of the global overturning circulation, a pattern of ocean currents that strongly influences climate. Several studies have recently shown that the properties of the bottom water in the Australian Antarctic Basin are changing. Monitoring the temperature, salinity and oxygen of bottom water will provide observations to detect how the Southern Ocean limb of the overturning circulation is responding to changes in high latitude climate forcing. The goal of the new Totten region location is to obtain measurements of \"warm\" inflow to, and (if possible) outflow from the Totten Glacier system. As it happened, access right to the Totten was not possible, and moorings were sited closer to the Dalton Iceberg Tongue and Moscow University Ice Shelf, possibly part of the Totten inflow story.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Research, development and extension (RD&E) is central to the competitiveness of Australia's agriculture industry. Growth in investment pushed the value of RD&E funding in Australia to $3.3 billion in 2014-15. Funding for rural R&D increased from $2.6 billion ten years before, in real terms. This includes public and private investment related to primary production, sustainable resource use, agricultural inputs and the processing sector. \r\n\r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Public sector delivering the R&D building blocks  \r\n\r\n• The public sector remains the largest overall source of rural R&D funding. Public funding for rural R&D increased from $1.4 billion to $1.54 billion (in real terms). This growth was driven by growth in funding from the Australian Government and universities, which offset a decline in funding from the state and territory governments. The public sector plays an important role in funding R&D particularly longer-term fundamental research. \r\n\r\n Private sector funding boosting R&D investment  \r\n\r\n• The private sector funding grew strongly over the ten years examined and now plays a greater role in funding rural R&D. Total private R&D funding increased from $912 million in 2005-06 to $1.46 billion in 2014-15 in real terms. Greater private funding stemmed from private firms increasing investment in their own R&D, with slower growth in contributions to the rural Research and Development Corporations (RDCs). \r\n\r\n Based on recent trends in Australia and internationally, the private sector has the potential to play a greater role in Australian R&D investment. The private sector concentres on marketable technologies like those related to seeds or chemicals that are more likely to generate additional profits. However, growth in private sector investment is not guaranteed and will depend on both the expected return on R&D investment and the international competitiveness of our R&D providers. \r\n\r\n Extending the ideas  \r\n\r\n• Getting innovations out of the laboratory and in to the field and factory is also essential to lift producer efficiency. Total rural extension funding is estimated at $316 million in 2014-15. Just under half of this funding was provided by the private sector through farm advisors to boost farm profitability. \r\n",

We acknowledge here the traditional custodians of this land, Kay-ye-my (denoting 'manly') clan of the Guringai people, and pay our respects to their elders past and present.\nMHL was established in 1944 under the then NSW Department of Public Works (now Public Works Advisory), to undertake hydraulic studies of the Oberon Dam. MHL is now a business unit within the Water Division of the Department of Planning and Environment.\nSince its establishment, MHL has developed specialist capabilities and experience in a range of coastal, water and environmental management areas to become NSW Government's specialist professional advisor in its core capability areas, which include:\n- flow and water quality measurement and investigations\n- oceanographic, coastal, estuarine and riverine process studies\n- investigation and design of hydraulic, coastal and maritime structures.\nMHL's recognised capabilities include the use of physical and numerical models integrated with our extensive coastal data collection and management experience to maximise public value in the solutions and advice we provide.\nMHL's experienced hydrographers operate one of the world's most comprehensive coastal and environmental data collection networks on behalf of NSW Government, hosting over 16,000 station years of continuous data extending from the 1980s.\nProfessional engineers and scientists utilise both numerical models and scaled physical hydraulic models in a broad range of studies. Our irregular and multi-directional wave modelling facilities and NATA accredited flow meter calibration capability are unmatched in Australia. MHL's commercial boats and registered divers offer scientific reconnaissance and maritime structure assessment capabilities.",

    "title": "South Australia - National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Map (PLUS)",
    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>dryland wheat</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP more than 12 times in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2015-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

The 2011/2012 audit against Local Government addressing revealed a 97.41% match rate, increased from 92.43% in 2008/2009 following the 2009 Address Completion Initiative. Key validation fields are 'source' and 'source_verified', respectively indicating the address source and date last validated against that source. The minimum address attributes required for a property address to be included in Vicmap Address are road name and locality. However, the principal address details include the unit/house number(s), road name (including any type or suffix) and locality (town/suburb/rural district). Vicmap Address is jointly maintained with Vicmap Property (VMPROP), with every address relating to a VMPROP  record, joined through a property_pfi link. Many additional attributes are included, where available, to facilitate use and relevance to the user community.\nN.B. Specifically excluded are non-property related, and electronic address details such as email, post office (PO) boxes, roadside delivery points (RSD's), roadside mail boxes (RMB's) and the like.\nCurrent data model: Version 6.1 (Oct 2016)",

    "description": "Based on Landgate’s high resolution aerial imagery, CSIRO generate the Urban Monitor mosaic from which vegetation height strata of endemic and exotic species has been calculated and reported as an area for each height strata of 0 – 3 m, 3 – 8 m, 8 – 15 m and 15+ m. The area of grass covered areas falling into the 0 – 50 cm range has also been calculated and recorded in square metres. Vegetation coverage greater than 3 metres in height has been deemed tree canopy. The canopies have been aggregated and reported as total canopy coverage in square metres. Urban Forest Mesh Blocks have been published for the following years: 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018.\n\nParcels to be analysed were sourced from the 2016 Integrated Land Information Database (ILID) and supplied to CSIRO by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. The results were assembled into Urban Forest features where the Urban Monitor coverage was complete.\n\nLand parcels were assigned locational data (2016 ABS meshblocks, suburbs, local government authority (LGA) and planning sub-region) based on the parcel centroid. They were then attributed with the following land use categories: • Street Block: residential, commercial, industrial, hospital/medical, educational, and some agricultural and transport land uses • Parks: public parks, open space, private recreation grounds and State Forest • Roads: roads including road reserves • Other Infrastructure: rail, airports and utilities infrastructure • Other: land uses in transition that have not progressed sufficiently to be Street Blocks or do not conform to urban form • Rural: primary production land that does not fall in categories above • Water: ocean and other waterways, including reservoirs\n\nThe vegetation height strata areas and total canopy coverage values were calculated for each land parcel. The statistics were then aggregated by the field MB_MonitorCategory, a concatenation of the fields MB_CODE16 and MonitorCategory. Canopy coverage percentages and ranges were calculated based on the sum of the area of parcels within each MB_MonitoryCategory. As parcels with sufficient Urban Monitor coverage for Urban Forest analysis may vary between years making comparison difficult, a field called MBPercentage was added which shows the percentage of the total MB_MonitorCategory area (MBArea) covered by parcels with Urban Forest values for that year. Corresponding MBPercentage values for all published years were also added to inform users.\n\nNOTE: As mesh block attributes were assigned based on parcel centroid, aggregated mesh block boundaries based on the parcels may not match ABS mesh block boundaries, and MBAreas will not match ABS mesh block areas.",

Male fiddler crabs of the species Uca mjoebergi typically have an enlarged yellow claw which they use for fighting and attracting a mate using a waving action. \n\nExperiments were conducted between Sept 03' to Jan '04 in the vicinity of the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT. \n\nThe experiment was designed to demonstrate the use of claw colouration as a species recognition signal in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. To test this, females were given a choice between size-matched, and handed matched U.signata and U.mjoebergi males. The colour of the males claw was manipulated using Dulux Tinytin gloss enamel paint.\n\nClaw colour was found to be the dominant morphological feature in identifying conspecific males in U.mjoebergi.\n\nMeasurements taken during every trial included: carapace size (males and females), treatment (males), claw size (males), claw side (males), number of trials, trial arrangement, and female choice.",

    "description": "Stands of remnant trees are important for conservation of biodiversity in the Urban District of Hornsby Shire. Particularly important are the stands of Blue Gum Shale Forest, Blue Gum Diatreme Forest and Turpentine-Ironbark Forest trees, because even in the absence of a native understorey, these are recognised as critically endangered or endangered communities under the NSW legislation (but not under the Commonwealth legislation).\nTwo separate studies of remnant trees were carried out - the urban district and the southern rural district.\nFor the urban district, a total of 569 stands of remnant trees were mapped, ranging in size up to about 2.9 ha, although predominantly less than 1 ha. The total area of the stands was about 130 ha in March 2007. The stands are remnants of 15 different native vegetation communities. Three of the communities are listed as critically endangered under either Commonwealth or NSW legislation; four others are listed as endangered; one is considered significant at regional level (Sydney region); and two are considered locally significant (Hornsby Shire).\nFor the southern rural district, A total of 866 stands of remnant trees were mapped, ranging in size up to about 6 ha. The total area of the stands was 408.8 ha in March 2007. The stands are remnants of 14 different native vegetation communities. Two of the communities are listed as critically endangered under Commonwealth legislation; three others are listed as endangered under NSW legislation; two others are considered significant at regional level around Sydney; and two others are considered locally significant in Hornsby Shire. Two of the communities (Shale Gravel Transition Forest and Angophora-Red Mahogany Forest) appear to be represented in Hornsby Shire only by remnant trees; these communities have not been recorded in the bushland areas of Hornsby Shire.

The data from some PULSE@Parkes observations are used to support the space missions, other observations supplement the P456 Pulsar Timing Array project and the remainder were chosen in order to make a detailed analysis of pulsar timing irregularities and intermittency.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset represents the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to contamination evaluated for unconfined aquifers in Fitzroy, based on the DRASTIC method (Aller et al. 1987). This semi-quantitative but spatially distributed method is especially suited for regional investigations with limited data availability. The DRASTIC index is calculated based on seven components: Depth to groundwater, net recharge, Aquifer media, soil media, topography (slope), impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer (Aller et al. 1987). Areas with unconfined aquifers or with shallow water tables receive a high index and, vice versa, area with fractured rock aquifers and deep water tables have a low index.\n\nFor the Fitzroy region, based on the spatial distribution of the index values, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered not possible if the DRASTIC index is less than 70. In grid cells with a DRASTIC index between 70 and 100, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered possible but not material. In areas with DRASTIC indices above 100, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered material and avoidance and mitigation strategies are considered.\n\nFurther information about the DRASTIC map and the development of this map is described in Holland et al. (2024) [Securing water for an emerging Australian hydrogen industry - Methods report].",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC10) was collected from a depth of 335 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~130cm into the core. Three samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; at the sediment surface (GC10-0) representing interglacial sediment, 100cm depth (GC10-100) and 270cm (GC10-270) - both of which represent glacial sediment. XRD analysis shows that during the interglacials aragonite increases relative to calcite, presumably as a result of shelf carbonate transported down the channel. During the glacials there is a higher percentage of quartz and feldspar, but reduced clay content in the non-carbonate fraction. This suggests that the terrigenous fraction is dominant within the sediments, however the energy in the environment is possibly too high for the clays to settle.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February - March 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213V4.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, February 28, 2013\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  March 14, 2013\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~6 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1991. For each day of sampling three resources are provided in the compressed (zipped) folder: 1) A map showing the location of each sampling station, 2) A word document providing vertically averaged CTD data over depth bins of 4m, and 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected, as well as coordinates of the stations.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "title": "North West Margin Transects : Cruise Proposal",
    "description": "The North West Margin Transects Cruise is part of a program being undertaken by AGSO to determine the structural architecture of the north-western margin of Australia and the influence of structuring on the location, migration and trapping ofhydrocarbons in the region. An important aspect of this program is the acquisition ofa series of full margin 'dip' transects extending from unrifted cratonic basement tobeyond the continent-ocean boundary, and at least two 'strike' transects that willextend along the full length of the shelf from the eastern Timor Sea to North WestCape. The major objective of the proposed cruise is to extend previous AGSO deepseismic surveys across the Browse (Survey 119), offshore Canning (SNOWS-3/Survey 120) and northern Carnarvon Basins (SNOWS-/Survey 101, SNOWS-2/Survey 110) to complete these margin transects. Specific objectives of theproposed survey are:\n*Determine the regional structural framework of the Scott Plateau area and itsrelationship to adjacent features such as the Argo Abyssal Plain, the BrowseBasin and the Rowley Sub-Basin of the offshore Canning Basin;\n*Determine the regional structural framework of the Exmouth Plateau and itsrelationship to adjacent features such as the Barrow-Dampier Sub-basin, and theArgo and Gascoyne Abyssal Plains.\n*Define the broad deep-crustal structure of the region and develop a modelexplaining the tectonic, subsidence and thermal history of the Scott Plateau andthe Exmouth Plateau in relation to the development of the continental margin andadjacent ocean basins.\n*Assess the effects of the deep crustal structures and their reactivation phases onthe development of known petroleum accumulations.\n\nTo address these objectives it is proposed that RV Rig Seismic be used to acquireabout 3276 km of deep crustal (16 second record length) multichannel seismic andother geophysical data along 9 transects across the outer margins of the Browse,offshore Canning and northern Carnarvon Basins. The survey will tie into the 1991SNOWS-1 (101), 1992 SNOWS-2 (110), 1993 Browse Basin (119) and SNOWS-3(120) surveys.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The dataset contains laboratory analyses of chemistry and environmental tracers on surface water samples collected from a subset of perennial waterholes along Cooper Creek during two targeted field sampling campaigns. The processes undertaken to produce the dataset are described in the 'History' field of this metadata statement.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset contains laboratory analyses of chemistry and environmental tracers on surface water samples collected from a subset of perennial waterholes along Cooper Creek during two targeted field sampling campaigns. Specific perennial waterholes targeted for water sampling were identified using a combination of spatial data (specifically the COO_Lakes_WH_WFS.shp dataset) to obtain accurate locations of perennial waterholes and cadastre data for both QLD and SA to identify the property associated with each waterhole. The sub-set of perennial waterholes sampled in this dataset were the waterholes that the GBA Program negotiated permission to access for sampling. Water samples were collected using a custom submersible electric pump and following strict sampling protocols using specialised sampling vessels depending on each sample type. The chemistry data includes general field and laboratory chemistry (i.e. pH, EC, alkalinity) as well as major and minor ions analysed using a combination of ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Environmental tracer data contained in this dataset includes 222Rn, 2H, 18O, 87Sr/86Sr, He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe which were analysed using a range of specialised analytical equipment at a variety of laboratories.",

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November-January in 2002-2006. \n\n15 male-female pairs were located and the burrow of the male or the female (in a random order) was blocked. We tethered a size-matched same-sex or opposite sex intruder (in a random order) half way between the burrows. Once the focal individual emerged we documented whether it pushed or grappled (fought) with the intruder within 5 minutes. After each trail, we unblocked the burrow and allowed the pair to interact normally for 10 minutes before running the next trail. In this way we observed the reactions of both pair members to same- and opposite-sex intruders. Therefore for each pair, 4 experiments were undertaken: original female vs. intruder female, original female vs. intruder male, original male vs. intruder male, original male vs. intruder female.   \n\nThe results indicated that males and females were equally likely to respond aggressively to intruders of the same sex. Both were less likely  to fight intruders of the opposite sex.",

    "description": "This data was collected in June 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST022008.\n\nDeparted: \tSuva, Fiji, June 08, 2008\nArrived:  \tCairns, Queensland, June 18, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents the number of households by household types for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2011 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for LGAs and Victoria in Future Small Areas (VIFSA) for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of offences recorded on the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP). Recorded offences include any criminal act or omission by a person or organisation for which a penalty could be imposed by the Victorian legal system. The data spans the years ending March in the period of 2010 to 2019 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe CSA recorded crime collection includes all offences that are reported to, and detected by, Victoria Police and recorded on the LEAP database. The scope and coverage of the data, however, is not representative of all crime that occurs in Victoria. Some crimes may not be recorded on LEAP, not be reported to police, or the responsibility for responding to certain offences may lie with another agency. Recorded offence data are compiled on the basis of the date that the offence was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the offence was detected by, or reported to police. The creation date may not be the date when the offence occurred, or the date when the offence came to the attention of police.\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRecorded crime statistics are based on data extracted by Victoria police on the 18th day after the reference period, and are subject to movement between releases.\n\n\nThe offences in the dataset are grouped according to the CSA offence classification.\n\n\nThe data excludes offences recorded at Justice institutions and immigration facilities, Unincorporated Victoria and where the geographic location is unknown or outside of Victoria.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, sensitive offence counts for subdivisions 'A10 Homicide and related offences' and 'A30 Sexual offences' with a value of 1 to 3 are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in July 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS032009.\n\nDeparted: \tLautoka Fiji, July 3, 2009\nArrived:  \tNoumea, New Caledonia, July 27, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The Geofabric Surface Network product provides a set of related feature classes to be used as the basis for production of consistent hydrological surface stream network analysis. This product contains a topographically consistent representation of the (major) surface water features of Australia (excluding external territories). Primarily, these are natural surface hydrology features but the product also contains some man-made features (notably reservoirs and other hydrographic features). The Geofabric Surface Network product is based upon the input from ANUDEM Derived Streams V1.1.2 (ANUDEM Streams) which is the vectorised version of the nine second ANUDEM derived raster steams product. The product is related to, but distinct from, the stream network contained in the Geofabric Surface Cartography product. The network product represents the flow direction of streams over the surface of the terrain, based on the GEODATA Nine Second Digital Elevation Model (DEM-9S) Version 3. This product is more generalised than the Geofabric Surface Cartography and represents the main channels of the stream, particularly in areas where streams are heavily anabranched or disconnected. In addition, the stream connectivity represents a stream flow over the terrain, regardless of the presence of a corresponding Geofabric Surface Cartography stream segment. This means that the Geofabric Surface Cartography product may represent a stream as an interrupted or intermittent feature, whereas this product represents the same stream as a continuous connected feature. That is, the path that a stream would take (according to the terrain model) if sufficient water were available for flow. This product is fully topologically correct which means that all the stream segments flow in the correct direction. It also has full connectivity based on the flow of water across a terrain model. This product contains six feature types including: Waterbody, Network Stream, Network Node, Catchment, Network Connectivity (Upstream) and Network Connectivity (Downstream).",

Enrolments in primary departments and secondary departments are included with the appropriate student data.\n\n\nSchools for specific purposes (SSPs) are for students with specific needs. Most SSPs have permanent enrolments and include schools for students with intellectual (mild, moderate and severe) and physical disabilities, visual or hearing impairment, behaviour disorders or emotional disturbance, and students in juvenile justice centres. Some SSPs have no permanent enrolments because the children temporarily attending them are enrolled and counted in their own schools.

    "description": "Argo Australia aims to undertake real time monitoring of the broad ocean state around Australia by maintaining an array of profiling (Argo) floats that measure temperature and salinity down to 2000m every 10 days in real time. This provides the essential and dominant in situ data stream for ocean and climate research and prediction/re-analyses.\n\nThe primary goal of the Argo program is to maintain a global array of autonomous profiling floats integrated with other elements of the climate observing system.\nThe specific aims are to:\n - detect climate variability over seasonal to decadal time-scales including changes in the large-scale distribution of temperature and salinity and in the transport of these properties by large-scale ocean circulation.\n - provide information needed for the calibration of satellite measurements.\n - deliver data for the initialization and constraint of climate models.\n\nArgo Australia is the third largest contributer to the global array (in terms of instrument numbers) after the Us and Japan.\n\nTo ensure 50% of the minimum design coverage of 1 float every 3 x3 degrees of latitude/longitude in the Australian region (i.e. between 90oE to 18oE, equator to Antarctic) requires deployment of 60 floats per year with the balance derived from international partners. The NCRIS investment along with currently identified Australian partners will provide for ~ 75 % of this requirement with further opportunities for co-investment. \n\nWork is underway to equip 30 floats per annum with oxygen sensors to address carbon cycle and biogeochemical cycling (BGC) variability in the Southern Ocean which is a significant component of the world climate and carbon cycling system. Additional investment would be required for this to occur.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated maize</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "Data describes vegetation extent priorities for each stream reach across the Melbourne Water region. Each reach is classified as either high, medium or low priority. To meet the performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018), high priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2028. To meet the target trajectory scores of the Healthy Waterways Strategy, medium priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2068. Vegetation priority reaches were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates.For the most up-to-date performance objectives, see the co-designed Catchment Programs at: https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy Results are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs.For further reading on the prioritisation process see:• Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership• Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document, Presentation of revegetation priority reaches for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThe dataset contains shapefiles of the the total combined foot prints of all polygons for each of Baseline, CRDP polygons, and the spatial difference between the two (i.e. ACRD). These shapefiles are used in both the surface water and groundwater modelling to define the spatial extent of the mine workings for the three scenarios.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nFor each of the surface water and groundwater modelling activities, polygons identified as baseline and ACRD were taken from the source data and merged and dissolved to create respective total baseline and ACRD layers.\n\n\n\nCRDP layers were created by merging the baseline and ACRD layers for SW and GW respectivelty. (CRDP = baseline + ACRD).\n\n\n\nCombined SW+GW layers were created by merging and dissolving the respective layers from the SW and GW sets for baseline, ACRD and CRDP respectively.\n\n\n\nRespective shapefiles have been dissolved to get overall baseline, ACRD and CRDP footprint area without double counting due to overlapping polygons.\n\n\n\nNote: The surface water modelling and groundwater modelling use different sets of mine footprints and even when the same mine has been used in both, the extent may be different for SW vs GW modelling.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) HUN Mine GW and SW mine footprint intersections v01.

    "description": "The digital ‘1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia’ comprises three layers: the primary 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology lines , and the 1:100 000 State linear structure layer. The product covers approximately 30% of Western Australia, with a focus on areas of exposed Archean and Proterozoic bedrock. The linear structure layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic bedrock structures. This compilation is based on Geological Survey of Western Australia’s (GSWA) published Geological Information Series (GIS) and Geological Exploration Packages (GEP) for which digital 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 interpreted bedrock geology is available. The data packages included are: Kimberley 2017, Tanami–Arunta 2016, West Musgrave 2017, East Albany–Fraser Orogen 2014 (1:250 000 pre-Mesozoic), West Capricorn 2016, East Yilgarn 2017, South Yilgarn 2016, Murchison 2017, and Pilbara 2014. Geological interpretation in these packages is based on extensive fieldwork and interpretation of geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and previously published and unpublished geological mapping. With the exception of minor topological corrections, the spatial integrity of the source packages is maintained. For adjacent but separately compiled packages, seamless interpretation along the edges of project areas has not been executed in order to preserve the spatial integrity of the source information. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the lithostratigraphic units in the polygon and line layers are based on weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships, and include more recent geochronology. The source package of each feature is captured as an additional attribute field. Individual packages are available via the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety’s (DMIRS) eBookshop.",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R2.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January 26, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, January 31, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

For most of these voyages, five minute underway digital data is available. The underway data set typically includes GPS location, Sea Surface Salinity and temperature, and Meteorology Station data. Later voyages also recorded digital echo sounder data. Individual metadata records have been created for each research voyage. The data is held in the CMAR Data Warehouse, which currently holds underway GPS data for more than 200 voyages.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth and reported smoking tobacco after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and reported smoking at any time during pregnancy, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and reported smoking after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, divided by the total number of females who gave birth and reported smoking during pregnancy, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nSmoking refers to the use of cigarettes or inhaled tobacco.\n\n\nData excludes mothers whose smoking status was not stated.\n\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is self-reported smoking of tobacco.\n\n\nBecause of differences in definitions and methods used for data collection, care must be taken when comparing across jursidictions.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3 year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "title": "Christmas Island Laser DEM Shiny Colour Drape Images - 2000",
    "description": "In 2000 AAM surveys Pty Ltd. was commisioned by the commonwealth to fly an airborne laser scanning survey of Christmas Island.  Raw data was tiled to shapefiles then converted to grids from which the LaserDEM shiny colour drape images were made. A wet look shiny colour drape algorithm was applied to each of the 27 '2000 LaserDEM Grid' tiles using ERMapper®, and the results saved as Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images in both 8 bit (256 colour) and 24 bit (16 million colour) formats. Each wet look shiny colour drape DEM tile was also saved as an Enhanced Compressed Wavelet (ECW) image. The colour range has been optimized for each individual tile to provide maximum information. A consequence of this is that colours may not match at adjoining edges. Each image tile has a 1m pixel size. Most inland tiles and several coastal tiles are 2km x 2km in area. The inland tiles located at the edge of the flight path extent, and most coastal tiles, deviate from the 2km x 2km standard tile size as adjacent tiles have been merged to minimize areas of no data and ocean.  The advantage of the 2000 Laser DEM over previous DEMs is that the laser scanner used to produce the DEM was able to penetrate vegetation. Previous DEMs included the height of tree tops rather than the ground elevation obscured by vegetation. The 2000 Laser DEM therefore provides a more accurate and detailed picture of the ground surface of Christmas Island. Topographic features overgrown with vegetation are apparent on the 2000 Laser DEM shiny colour drape images, where in previous versions of CIGIS DEMs they were not.\n\nAAM Surveys Pty Ltd Indicate that the horizontal accuracy of the airborne laser scanner is between 0.3 and 0.5 metres.\n\nLaserDEM shiny colour drape image tiles have been produced for the eastern half of the island only, as only the eastern half of the island has been surveyed with the laser scanner.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

    "description": "The Macquarie Island Helicopter Exclusion Zone was created in January 2005 in consultation with Peter Cusick, Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania.  The zone was created by buffering the coastline by 1 km on the seaward side of the island, generally following the escarpment on the interior of the island and buffering the refuges by 200 m to create an approximately 400 m wide  corridor to the refuges. Access corridors were also created at the station.  The Australian Antarctic Data Centre's topographic data representing  coastline, escarpment and refuges was used. In March 2007 the zone was modifed in consultation with Terry Reid, Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania. The corridors to the refuges were extended through to the escarpment.  The Helicopter Exclusion Zone is shown in a map of the island (see link below).",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This publication summarises the forecasts presented in the December 2016 editions of ABARES Australian crop report and Agricultural commodities as well as material from an ABARES report on productivity in the Australian grains industry released in October 2016. \r\n\r\n This publication was commissioned by the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC). \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n\r\n World indicator prices of wheat and coarse grains are forecast to fall in 2016-17 as a result of expected plentiful supplies globally. In contrast, world oilseeds indicator prices are forecast to rise because of a fall in supplies in the early part of 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were generally in very good condition at the end of winter. Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tTotal area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tThe cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth--at 1.8 per cent--of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity growth include larger machinery and cropping equipment, new plant varieties, better water management and a better understanding of harvesting and planting strategies.

    "description": "The Marine Science voyage (VMS) was conducted on the Aurora Australis between 4 January 2011 and 6 February 2011. The voyage incorporated oceanographic measurements along the CLIVAR SR3 Transect and around the Mertz Glacier region. Underwater still images were collected from 93 sites ranging in depth from 170 m to 2300 m across George V shelf in East Antarctica. The camera equipment was designed and operated by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) marine science support team. The camera was attached to either the CTD frame or the beam trawl frame and lowered to 4-5 m from the seafloor and held in position for 2-15 minutes. All still images were stamped with UTC time. Stations were named according to the frame (e.g. CTD or BT), the sequence number of that particular frame (e.g. CTD53), followed by the instrument used (e.g. CAM for camera) and then the deployment number. For example, BT5_CAM16 was the fifth deployment using the beam trawl frame and the sixteenth camera deployment of the survey overall. For further information please refer to the post-survey report (GA Record 2011/xx - Geocat #71668)",

The workflow for the model development is described in detail in Clarence-Moreton bioregional assessment product 2.1-2.2 (Raiber et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nThe sources for the binding surfaces are all geological data and digital elevation models (outlined in Raiber et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nThese include: \n\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model\n\nCoal seam gas, petroleum and stratigraphic wells\n\nGroundwater bores\n\nShapefiles of the extent of different stratigraphic units\n\nA table of revised formation tops provided by Metgasco Limited\n\nGrids of key formation tops (Richmond coal seams, Kangaroo Creek Sandstone, Gatton Sandstone and Koukandowie Formation) provided by Metgasco Limited\n\nGrids of formation tops provided by the NSW Department of Trade and Investment for stratigraphic units including the Walloon Coal Measures, Koukandowie Formation and other deeper layers.\n\n\n\nFrom these data sources, the 3D geological model was developed in GoCAD&trade; and SKUA&trade; (Paradigm Geophysical Pty Ltd, version 2009.4 and version 2014.1, respectively). An add-on on GoCAD, MIRA Mining utilities, was also extensively used. \n\n\n\nPrior to use, all data were subjected to considerable data quality check. Interfaces such as those between the alluvium and the underlying volcanic or sedimentary bedrock are based primarily on data from groundwater bores. The data cleaning process and the steps involved in creating these interfaces is described in detail in Clarence-Moreton bioregional assessment product 2.1-2.2 (Raiber et al., 2016).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) CLM bioregion 3D geological model.

    "description": "This data was collected in July 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2012_V03.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, July 11, 2012\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, July 24, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The Australian Lithospheric Architecture Magnetotelluric Project (AusLAMP) is a collaborative national survey that acquires long-period magnetotelluric data on a half-degree grid spacing (approximately 55 km) across the Australian continent. This project aims to map the electrical conductivity/resistivity structure in the crust and mantle beneath the Australian continent. Geoscience Australia has a significant investment in AusLAMP and is a key contributor to the delivery of this national program.\n\nGeoscience Australia, in partnership with State and Northern Territory Geological Surveys, has also undertaken regional-scale MT surveys, along onshore deep reflection seismic transects and in potential mineral and energy provinces across the country. The targeting signal range is 10 KHz – 1000 s, which provide an investigation depth from tens of metres to tens of kilometres. These data provide new insights into basement architecture and resource potential in these regions. \n\nWe will present some new models and results from AusLAMP data and regional survey data, showing a remarkable correlation between conductive anomalies, crustal-scale boundaries and the distribution of giant mineral deposits. For example, the Carpentaria Conductivity Anomaly at the eastern margin of the Mount Isa Province characterises the position and geometry of the ancient Gidyea Suture Zone. The distribution of known gold and copper deposits shows a close spatial correlation with the suture zone, indicating that this structure is potentially a fundamental control on IOCG deposits in its vicinity. The implication is that crustal-penetrating structures act as potential pathways for fluid movement to form mineral deposits in the upper crust.\n\nThis Abstract was submitted/presented to the Biennial Meeting of the Specialist Group for Tectonics and Structural Geology (SGTSG) and the Specialist Group in Solid Earth Geophysics (SGSEG), Convergence on the Coast, 18-22 November 2019 Port Lincoln, South Australia",

    "description": "Analysing the economic potential of forestry for carbon sequestration under alternative carbon price paths  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n The introduction of a carbon price under the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) may be effective in promoting afforestation in Australia and contribute to Australia's emissions target through carbon sequestration. Rates of sequestration will depend on the stringency of the emissions reduction target, and hence the level of the carbon price. However, the rate of afforestation arising because of the carbon price may potentially affect the attractiveness of agricultural land use activities in Australia. In general, higher carbon prices are expected to decrease the profitability and attractiveness of other land use activities, such as agriculture, in favour of timber plantations and environmental plantings which generate carbon credits under the CPRS. \r\n\r\n ABARE has been commissioned by the Commonwealth Treasury to estimate the potential increase in afforestation activity on agricultural land under four hypothetical scenarios and a reference case. The key assumptions underlying ABARE estimates are described in some detail in this report. Assumptions relating to the cost of investment of afforestation and the area of land available for switching are important determinants of the land use conversion. Afforestation activity is assumed to include the establishment of commercial plantations and environmental plantings between 2007 and 2100. ",

    "description": "The Tuncurry Passive Acoustic Observatory (near Tuncurry/Forster, NSW) consists of two to four moorings fitted with /hydrophones set on the seabed at 130-190 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of:\n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and\n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian).\n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",

It includes information pertaining to Historic Shipwreck and Historic Relics as described under the (Commonwealth) Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 and the (South Australian) Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981.\nThe dataset includes shipwrecks that have not yet been declared under either of these Acts. Filtering may take place to restrict the location of sensitive shipwrecks where condition assessments are pending.\nThe Maritime Register (XML) contains the image URL which can be matched to the image name.

    "description": "The Distribution Priority Area (DPA) classification system for GPs is a mechanism used by the Government to encourage a more equitable distribution of GPs who are restricted under s19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973, including International Medical Graduates (IMGs) and Foreign Graduates of Accredited Medical Schools (FGAMS).\r\n\r\n• The DPA classification system is also used to distribute Australian-trained Bonded doctors who have a return of service obligation.\r\n• The Distribution Priority Area (DPA) replaced the Districts of Workforce Shortage (DWS) system for GPs in 2019. DWS remains in use for non-GP specialists.\r\n• DPA considers the demographics of a region, including age, gender and socio-economic groupings, along with MBS activity data, to determine a benchmark figure that reflects community need for GP service.\r\n• DPA is calculated for 824 distinct, non-overlapping GP catchments throughout Australia. Catchments assessed below the benchmark are classified DPA.\r\n• Areas classified MM 2-7 under the Modified Monash Model (MMM) geographical remoteness classification system are automatically DPA. MM1 Inner metropolitan locations are automatically non-DPA. Areas that held DPA status prior to this update will continue to hold DPA status under a No Losers policy.\r\n\r\nThe attached file for the DPA is as at March 2025 (most recent annual update). As the files may be updated at short notice for program purposes, please ensure you use the Department of Health and Aged Care Health Workforce Locator (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/health-workforce-locator) for the most up-to-date and official DPA location status.\r\n ",

    "description": "Summary of Management Plan\n\n(1) Most of the flood damage reduction measures considered as part of the 1993 Floodplain\nManagement Study cannot be justified on benefit-cost considerations. They could be\nreconsidered if new information becomes available that leads to substantially increased\nbenefit-cost ratios.\nNotwithstanding, Option 1E from the 1993 Floodplain Management Study was shown to have\na Benefit-Cost ratio of about 0.4 and therefore should be retained within the Plan. This\nfloodplain management strategy involved the voluntary raising of a 39 houses located in areas\nof Edgeworth, Barnsley and Boolaroo that are potentially flood affected. It is recommended\nthat these houses be re-assessed and prioritised in terms of their suitability for house raising.\nOnce a prioritised list has been determined, steps should be undertaken to implement the\nstrategy.\n(2) The Flood and Floodplain Management Studies on which this Plan is based should be revisited.\nThe reason for this and the process that should be followed is outlined in Appendix C.\nThe majority of the floodplain management options considered in the 1993 study are either\nnot viable from a cost/benefit perspective or may not be considered appropriate now. Hence,\ncontemporary floodplain management issues need to be determined through consultation with\nthe Committee and key stakeholders within the community. It is not clear whether any\nconsultation took place as part of earlier studies. However, this is considered to be essential\nto managing future flooding issues that may arise along creek system and its floodplain. This\ncould be achieved by distribution of a brochure similar to that included in Appendix A.\n(3) Development within areas defined in Figure 4 as 2A, 2B and 2C, should be able to proceed\nwithout extensive independent flood investigations, provided all appropriate requirements\nspecified by the current Local Environment Plan are addressed (eg., those related to filling).\n(4) Development Restrictions Flooding/Tidal Inundation Certificates should be revised to\nincorporate the predicted peak level of the Probable Maximum Flood or an ‘extreme’ flood.\nThe format of Development Restrictions Flooding/Tidal Inundation Certificates could be\nmodified to provide more information.\n(5) Further investigations need to be undertaken to determine whether flood damage reduction\nmeasures can be implemented for those problem areas listed in Section 4.3.1\n(6) Further hydraulic investigations should be undertaken the determine the amount of time\nbefore inundation of key areas along Cockle Creek in a typical major flood.\n(7) A flood liable lands DCP is to be developed specifically for the Cockle Creek catchment. The\nDCP would effectively serve as a revised Flood Policy and relate to the specifics of flood\nbehaviour in the catchment (as distinct from the lake inundation flood behaviour that applies\nin other areas of Lake Macquarie City).",

    "description": "The Full Carbon Accounting Model (FullCAM) was developed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the land sector, for inclusion in Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Accounts produced annually. Forest Productivity Index (FPI) data is used within FullCAM during the modelling process, to incorporate the impact of climate variability on yields of woody biomass.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of forest growth is fundamental to estimating the carbon stocks (and biomass) of mature forests and rates of carbon accumulation in any forest regrowth. \r\n\r\nThe FPI estimates forest growth using a simplified version of the 3-PG (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) growth model, as described in Australian Greenhouse Office Technical Report No.23 (Kesteven et al. 2004). The growth model is based on the relationship between the amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies (APAR) and various productivity modifiers that affect plant growth. \r\n\r\nTo create the FPI a wide variety of inputs are used including various soil and climate inputs as well as a normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI provides an estimate of vegetation health and a means of monitoring changes in vegetation over time and is one of the most common vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data. \r\n\r\nThe product release contains 37 folder zip files which cover the continent of Australia. Each zip files holds 53 yearly FPI raster tif files of approximately 1km resolution on GDA94 from 1970 to 2022. \r\n",

    "description": "In recent years the term 'enhanced greenhouse effect' has become well known in modern society and yet aspects of this possible 'future climate' are poorly understood. The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. From core MD032607 the annual mean SST (Tmean) indicates a temperature range of 9oC±0.84oC between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to MIS 5, representing the largest sea surface temperature (SST) transition from a glacial to interglacial. The results also suggest that there is more stratification in the water column during interglacial periods as opposed to glacials. Conversely, temperatures gradients are reduced during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and MIS 6 suggesting a well mixed homogenised mixed layer.",
