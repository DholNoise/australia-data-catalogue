The data covers migrating settlers with a Date of Settlement between 01/07/2020 and 30/06/2021. The location data is aggregated based on the Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries of the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data in this dataset are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit Data.gov.au.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data with the 2011 LGA boundaries of the ABS Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC). Where the recorded number of settlers is less than 5 (\"&lt;5\" in the original table), it has been set to 4 for confidentiality.",

This data is designed for use by planners to assess whether development applications for specific sites require additional conditions on the basis of whether normal land development activities carry a risk of disturbing PASS materials. Disturbance risk is rated on the basis of the likelihood of PASS materials being encountered within 3m of the ground surface should this depth of soil be disturbed in any way. The depth of 3m is considered since this was regarded as the depth that most soil disturbance activities would extend during in most land development processes. Disturbance activities in this context include drainage, excavations and dewatering. For further information phone the Contaminated Sites hotline 1300 762 982.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Acid Sulfate Soil Risk Map, Geraldton (DER-009).\nThis dataset is no longer actively maintained by DWER.",

The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle.

Georeferenced TIF image of the magentics of the Beetaloo Sub-basin and adjacent area.  Total magnetic intensity (TMI) data measures variations in the intensity of the Earth magnetic field caused by the contrasting content of rock-forming minerals in the Earths crust. Magnetic anomalies can be either positive (field stronger than normal) or negative (field weaker) depending on the susceptibility of the rock. The 2015 Total magnetic Intensity (TMI) grid of Australia has a grid cell size of ~3 seconds of arc (approximately 80 m). This grid only includes airborne-derived TMI data for onshore and near offshore continental areas.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessments\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset is a clip of the Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) Grid of Australia 2015 (sixth edition) for the area immediately surrounding the Beetaloo GBA region.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of Affected Family Members (AFMs) of Family Violence Intervention Order (FVIO) applications heard in the Victorian Children's Court, retrieved from Courtlink. The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of AFMs per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of AFMs on original applications in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: AFM Rate = (Number of AFMs/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nTo avoid double counting individuals, demographic information of applicants/AFMs and respondents are of those on original applications.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nDue to improvements made in data processing since the database release ending 30 June 2017, slight movement has occurred in numbers of AFMs and the number of applications outcomes.\n\n\nData was extracted from Courtlink on 30 August 2018.\n\n",

    "description": "Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2002-2022. It shows floor space (in square meters) per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC1) and small area allocation. \n\nThe City of Melbourne creates unique codes to account for floor space allocated to residential space, vacant space, open space and common area. These unique codes are not included within ANZSIC 1 classification and therefore these floor areas are not included in this data set.\n\nThis data set has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The row and column totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.\n\nNon-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement.

    "description": "*Forests of Australia (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation\r\nand land cover data inputs, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as:\r\n\"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single\r\nstem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2021) (unpublished, also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2020), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map as forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "title": "Urban Development Program - Major Residential Redevelopments Sites 2022",
    "description": "The Urban Development Program (UDP) monitors and reports on major residential redevelopment projects across metropolitan Melbourne. Major redevelopment projects are those comprising ten or more dwellings. Data is collected from administrative and commercial data sources and through analysis of aerial imagery.\nThese include projects which may have an existing planning permit, or are in the planning processes, those that are current under construction, as well as potential longer term projects on sites that local councils have identified for residential purposes.\nA timing classification is attributed to each project based on commercial data sources, consultation with local councils, and the stage the project has reached in the planning process. The Urban Development Program reports on major redevelopment projects using the following categories:\n\n<em>Completed - Projects completed from Jan 2021 to Jan 2022\n</em>Under Construction - Projects under construction at Jan 2022\n<em>Firm - Projects that have been approved and/or taking sales enquires and registrations. \n</em>Likely - Projects that are within the planning process, projects with recently lapsed planning permits, projects that have been sold with a recent planning permit\n*Possible - Early indicator of the location of future major redevelopment projects or projects that have been inactive for a number of years.\n\nWhile the UDP acknowledges a proportion of proposed projects may be abandoned or delayed, the classification process provides an indicator of available supply provided there is sufficient demand. In addition, it is acknowledged there are also sites within the established parts of Melbourne that may be suitable for residential development into the future but have not yet been identified. The UDP will continue to report on these sites as they are identified for redevelopment for residential purposes.\nIt should also be noted that the timings attached to these projects are indicative. Construction rates can be cyclical in nature, and highly dependent on underlying demand and pre-sales, economic cycles and industry capacity. This can mean that stated development intentions will vary from on the-ground construction activity over time and by location.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the biomass sampling component of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80 deg C)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with GP costs, and out-of-pocket cost per GP attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare-subsidised patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances exclude services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Section 30A is an overriding provision of the Environment Protection Act under\nwhich the EPA can authorise discharges, emissions, storage, treatment,\ndisposal and handling of waste in emergencies and other temporary situations\nthat would otherwise be an offence under the Act.  \n30A approvals are not issued lightly, as they permit activities that would not\nnormally be allowed.  \nOwners, occupiers or operators of commercial or industrial premises (with or\nwithout an EPA licence) may apply for a 30A approval. Examples of 30A\napprovals include emergency events (such as clean-up after a bushfire or\nflood), temporary events (like temporary relief of a public nuisance or\ncommunity hardship) and commissioning (bringing new equipment on or offline).  \nEPA decides when to issue a 30A approval on a case-by-case basis, but we must\nrespond to applications promptly. The approval must be consistent with the\npurpose, principles and other provision of the Act.  \nEPA takes a risk-based approach to the assessment of a 30A approval to ensure\nthat the proposed activities:\n are appropriate for the event\nwill not cause any long-term damage to the environment\nconsider the needs of the community and other stakeholders.  \n30A approvals can last for up to 120 days.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of female cancer mortality statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 11 top cancer groupings (breast, cervical, colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, ovary, pancreas, thyroid and uterus) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a GCCSA. The number of people who could not be assigned a GCCSA is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia carried out marine surveys in south-east Tasmania in 2008 and 2009 (GA0315) to map seabed bathymetry and characterise benthic environments through observation of habitats using underwater towed video. Data was acquired using the Tasmania Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute (TAFI) Research Vessel Challenger. Bathymetric mapping was undertaken in seven survey areas, including: Freycinet Pensinula (83 sq km, east coast and shelf); Tasman Peninsula (117 sq km, east coast and shelf); Port Arthur and adjacent open coast (17 sq km); The Friars (41 sq km, south of Bruny Island); lower Huon River estuary (39 sq km); D Entrecastreaux Channel (7 sq km, at Tinderbox north of Bruny Island), and; Maria Island (3 sq km, western side). Video characterisations of the seabed concentrated on areas of bedrock reef and adjacent seabed in all mapped areas, except for D Entrecastreaux Channel and Maria Island. Seabed sediment samples were collected by TAFI in August 2010 in a targeted area to the east of Tasman Peninsula. Samples were collected at 25 stations using a Van Veen grab, from which a 50 - 100 g sub-sample was taken and submitted to Geoscience Australia for analysis. This dataset is a contribution to the CERF Marine Biodiversity Hub.",

    "description": "The data set contains airborne pollen concentrations (grains per cubic meter) from samples taken at Rocklea, Queensland, Australia (-27.5351,152.9933) between October 2016 and June 2020. Each data row has two concentrations: one for grass (Poaceae) and one for all other pollens. For comparison with other data sets and between pollen seasons the data weeks start at July 1 each calendar year. Extra days at the end of the pollen year are included in week 52. Each data row has a collection period start date, the number of days within the collection period (7-9), and the number of days on which pollen was collected and summed (0-9). Concentrations represent only the number of days collected and not always the full collection period, as indicated. \nAirborne pollen samples were collected using a volumetric continuous flow impaction sampler (Burkard Manufacturing, UK), stained with fuchsin and counted by light microscopy according to best practice described in the Australian Airborne Pollen and Spore Monitoring Network Interim Standard and Protocols (Version 2, 14 September 2018).\nData may be used for modelling and forecasting airborne grass, other, total pollen levels. Other uses include analysis of the effect of pollen levels on asthma and allergy presentations, or in inference of grass and other vegetation growth patterns. Data may also be used for evaluation of medium or long-term trends over time or comparison withpollen exposure levels between spatial distant locations.\nMetadata about this and other AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network monitoring sites is provided on the National Environmental Monitoring Site Register. Information about other pollen and spores monitored can be found by the AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network Species Classification on the ARDC Research Vocabularies site.\nAURIN has added latitude, longitude and spatialised geometry columns for each row based on the coordinates of the pollen samples. Periods over which no data is available are marked as null.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has set suppressed values (\".\") as Null.",

This requires international cooperation, policy making, capacity building and technology transfer.There are 5 Ramsar sites within Queensland (Administrator is shown in brackets): Moreton Bay (Queensland), Bowling Green Bay (Queensland), Currawinya Lakes (Queensland), Shoalwater and Corio Bays (Queensland/ Commonwealth), Great Sandy (Queensland).",

    "description": "This data was collected in August/September 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V04.\n\nDeparted: \tFremantle, WA, Aug 25, 2011\nArrived:   \tGeraldton, WA, Sep 13, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2017. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nTwenty-seven crabs (13 males, 14 females) were observed on the day after spring tide over several semilunar cycles. Digital photos of the crabs were taken before, during and after low tide. These photographs were examined for any changes in colour or pattern. \n\nUca capricornis do not regularly change their colouration over the course of the day. Of the 27 individuals observed, 24 did not noticeably change their colour, and none altered their pattern.",

As part of the Geological Survey of NSW Seamless Geology Project, a Bedrock Exposure map of NSW UTM Zone 56 has been created through combining aspects of: (i) Office of Environmental Heritage soil data; (ii) CSIRO depth of regolith dataset and; (iii) the Geological Survey of NSW field observation and structural point dataset. The bedrock exposure map was created to provide a reliable, spatial approximation of exposed bedrock, so as to benefit field mapping. The current maps provided in the UTM Zone 56 Seamless Geodatabase overestimate the amount of exposed bedrock, and therefore, provide only an approximate indication to the location of outcropping basement rocks. The map was created by: (i) using the CSIRO National Soil and Landscape Grid as a base map, and; (ii) refining this by clipping out GSNSW Field Observations, which represent areas of known outcrop. The final result shows the location of estimated and known outcrop.",

    "description": "Measurements of temperature within the snow / firn cover in Wilkes Land East Antarctica were made along the routes of oversnow traverses operating out of Casey (66.6 S 110 E).  In general, measurements were made at a nominal depth of ten metres as a first estimate of mean annual surface temperature of the ice sheet, and for many sites, at some additional depths, typically around twenty metres.  Actual depths of measurements are included with the temperature data as well as date of observation.  No attempt has been made to apply any correction for seasonal or interannual variation.\n\nTwo different methods were used to drill the access holes: an ice coring auger (usually PICO drill, originally SIPRE drill); a steam drill.  In some areas depth of drilling was limited by problems associated with the texture of the firn and difficulties in recovery of material from the hole.\n\nWhere relevant, date of drilling is included with the data, or time elapsed between drilling and temperature measurement.  Temperature measurements were made using 100 ohm platinum resistance elements with resistance measured using a 'Leeds and Northrup' resistance bridge.  The bridge uses a zero/nul measurement technique, thus avoiding heating effects in the sensor Refer quality entry for further details).\n\nThese data form part of the data collected for ASAC projects 456 (Properties and Structure of Antarctic Snow and Ice ), 458 (Characteristics, Dynamics and Mass Budget of the Ice Sheet in Wilkes Land ) and 2224 (Glacier dynamics and mass discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet, 45 degrees -160 degrees E) - ASAC_456, ASAC_458, ASAC_2224).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nsite_id (the marker code of the measurement site)\n\nobservation_date (date on which measurement was made, in ISO8601 format yyyy-mm-dd)\n\nobservation_date_year (year of measurement date)\n\nobservation_date_month (month of measurement date)\n\nobservation_date_day (day of measurement date)\n\ntemperature (degrees C)\n\ndepth_of_observation (m)\n\nlatitude\n\nlongitude\n\ndrill_type\n\ndate_drilled\n\ncomment\n\ndays_between_drilling_and_measurement\n\n",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the listed Littoral Rainforest and Coastal Vine Thickets of Eastern Australia found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n• The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n      o Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n• The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n      o Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n\n•\tWhile reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "As part of Geoscience Australia's analysis of the Capel-Faust basins this report summarises the construction methodology and the resulting geological and prospectivity implications of the Capel-Faust 3D geological model. The Capel and Faust basins are located over the northern part of the Lord Howe Rise, a large offshore frontier region composed of a number of rift basins with unknown petroleum prospectivity. Geoscience Australia has been undergoing a program of data acquisition in this area over a number of years, yet most dataset coverage remains regional with little well control. Given the diversity of acquired data, the comparative sparseness of coverage (despite the new data acquisition) and the structural complexity of basins, effective data integration and analysis methods were essential in the Capel-Faust region. By using the 3D visualisation and modelling environment provided by GOCAD, the diverse datasets were captured, processed and interpreted to create an integrated basin model that enabled key geological and prospectivity questions to be answered.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset contains the extent of the coastal zone for the Great Barrier Reef. This extent was identified as the most suitable area to be investigated on land and at sea as part of a conservation planning project looking at coastal development along the GBR coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial part of the coastal zone was initially defined in consultation with stakeholders and included the Queensland Government¿s definition as ¿either: five kilometres from the coastline; or where land first reaches the height of 10 metres Australian Height Datum (AHD), whichever is further from the coast¿ (Queensland Coastal Management Plan). However, the Queensland government definition corresponds to a narrow strip of coastline in most areas and does not encompass most of coastal land uses (and their potential future expansion) that have a significant impact on the marine environmental such as agriculture. In the context of biodiversity conservation and water quality, workshop participants were asked what the coastal zone meant to them. The answers were summarised into four main categories:\r\n1- Intensive coastal-based agriculture,\r\n2- Geomorphological characteristics,\r\n3- Typical coastal vegetation, and\r\n4- Human presence and activities.\r\nThe coastal zone was defined to include all features that would match these four categories, and that also included the Government¿s definition. The marine part of the coastal zone was also defined during this process and the offshore boundary was described as the maximum flood plume extent (secondary flood plume) as in Álvarez-Romero et al. 2013. The extent was smoothed to allow a clear area to be defined. This covers the areas that are have the greatest level of impacts from coastal development, in particular from run-off.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nGBR_coastal_zone.shp (and all associated files as part of the shapefile)\r\nThis dataset contains a polygon that defines the extent of the area identified as the most appropriate coastal zone of the Great Barrier Reef to investigate conservation planning, in particular spatial planning of coastal development to ensure the health for the GBR World Heritage Area.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nÁlvarez-Romero, J.

By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Darwin City SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Hawkesbury Nepean catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "BMT WBM was commissioned by Bankstown City Council to prepare a Flood Study for the Cooks\nRiver stormwater catchment. Similar studies were simultaneously commissioned for the Punchbowl,\nthe Georges Hall, the Lansdowne and the Miller Road stormwater catchments. The location of the\nCooks River stormwater catchment is shown in Figure 1-1.\n\nThe study has been undertaken under the direction of Bankstown City Council and their Floodplain\nManagement Committee. The Committee includes Councillors and Council staff, officers from the\nOffice of Environment &amp; Heritage (OEH), the State Emergency Service and community\nrepresentatives.\nThe study investigates flood behaviour throughout the Cooks River stormwater catchment for existing\ncatchment conditions as at 2012. This includes the analysis of:\n<ul>\n<li>Flows within the underground pipe drainage network; and</li>\n<li>Surface runoff across the catchment.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA two-dimensional computer model was established for the catchment to analyse stormwater flood\nbehaviour under existing catchment conditions. The model provides information on the extent of flood\ninundation, flood depths and flood velocities throughout the catchment for design floods ranging from\nrelatively frequent events to more extreme floods. Full details are outlined in the Cooks River\nCatchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as Appendix C.\n\nResults from this study will form the technical basis for the Floodplain Risk Management Study. The\nFloodplain Risk Management Study will identify areas of high flood risk and investigate options to\nmanage and reduce this risk. Assistance will be sought from the community to help identify these\nareas and to derive appropriate solutions during the subsequent study.\n\nThe flood model developed during this study will provide Council with a valuable tool to assess the\nfuture development in the catchment.\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all public drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Indicative information on drainage asset performance for various storm events;</li>\n<li>A property database including surveyed floor levels, flood levels and the resulting floor level\nimmunity, expressed in the magnitude of a storm event;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood behaviour due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "A study of the response of phytoplankton to rainfall in Sydney Harbour, on the 22nd October 2004, is reported here. Sydney Harbour is an important port and recreational region for the city of Sydney. Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

Publication of some data in this dataset has been suppressed (before 9 March 2020) or is being delayed because the risk of gaining information about an individual in the dataset increases as the number of cases decreases.\nThis dataset has been discontinued from 19 November 2021. NSW Health now reports daily COVID-19 cases as a total of local and overseas cases. With quarantine-free international travel, overseas origin of cases can no longer be determined immediately, but will be included in the NSW Health COVID-19 weekly surveillance reports.\nThe data is for confirmed COVID-19 cases only based on location of usual residence, not necessarily where the virus was contracted. The case definition of a confirmed case is a person who tests positive to a validated specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test or has the virus identified by electron microscopy or viral culture, at a reference laboratory. Data reported at 8pm daily.\nCase counts reported by NSW Health for a particular notification date may vary over time due to ongoing investigations and the outcome of cases under review thus this dataset and any historical data contained within is subject to change on a daily basis.\nThe underlying dataset was assessed to measure the risk of identifying an individual and the level of sensitivity of the information gained if it was known that an individual was in the dataset. The dataset was then treated to mitigate these risks, including suppressing and aggregating data. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth and reported smoking tobacco in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and reported smoking in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, divided by the total number of females who gave birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nSmoking refers to the use of cigarettes or inhaled tobacco.\n\n\nData excludes mothers whose smoking status was not stated.\n\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is self-reported smoking of tobacco.\n\n\nBecause of differences in definitions and methods used for data collection, care must be taken when comparing across jursidictions.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The second sequence used telemetery to send binary data daily to a computer controlled base station. Data was verified by comparing three sets of the same data, received over three days. The base station passed data to the central computing facility at AIMS for processing. Lightning destroyed this system in 1985.\n\nData recorded: Wind direction (0-360°); Wind speed (km/hr); Air temperature (°C); Barometric pressure (mb); Solar radiation PAR (µE/sec/m²).\n\nOther variables:\nTime of day (e.g. 21:53:54); Day of year (e.g.118); Year (e.g. 86).",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This technical report estimates the responsiveness of demand for structural pine to changes in timber and steel prices. Measures of demand responsiveness can provide valuable insights into the potential implications of changes in policy or market settings on volumes and prices received by producers. The analysis focuses on estimating short-term price elasticities of demand--a formal measure of the sensitivity of demand--to changes in prices in the same quarter or recent past. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The estimates in this report suggest that the importance of timber and steel prices on the quantity of structural timber demanded in the short-run is limited. However, the volume of residential construction activity was found to have a substantial effect for demand of domestically produced structural pine products. In particular, new house commencements explain a great deal of the quarter-on-quarter changes in the quantity of domestic structural pine sales. This confirms the common assertion by industry that house commencements are the primary driver for structural timber demand within Australia. \r\n\r\n Looking forward, changes in consumer preferences, socio-demographic trends and building regulations will likely play a much greater role in the choice of building materials used in housing construction compared with timber and steel prices. Trends suggest consumers are placing more weight on the environmental benefits of structural materials. Changing architectural styles will change the material requirements for a standard home. A global trend towards higher-density living will likely promote a shift toward multi-unit buildings, with recent changes to the National Construction Code opening the way for increased timber use in the midrise construction market, leading to greater timber use in multi-level buildings. \r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated rice</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2016-17</em>. Annual Plan and Budget documents are available on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/about-council/news-and-publications/news-and-publications/council-annual-plan-and-budget\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.\n\nFor more information about Brisbane City Council’s budget, please visit www.brisbane.qld.gov.au or phone Council’s Contact Centre on (07) 3403 8888.",

    "description": "The New South Wales Mooring Sub-Facility is part of the Australian National Mooring Network. \n\nThis sub-facility is establishing a transect of moorings and measurements off Sydney, which includes the Port Hacking (Sydney) National Reference Station (NRS). Like the NRS sites at Maria and Rottnest Islands, data has been collected for over 70 years at Port Hacking. The transect consists of three moorings in 65, 100 and 140m of water off Bondi and a mooring in 100m at the Port Hacking NRS, where monthly biogeochemical water sampling is conducted. This region is typically downstream of where the East Australian Current (EAC) separates from the coast, and is often influenced by EAC eddies. Data collection supports research on the marine ecosystems associated with these eddies and, as the sub-facility is located in the most densely populated area of Australia, issues such as water quality, waste disposal, shipping hazards, harmful algal blooms and recreation are also of particular research interest.\n\nThe sub-facility has also deployed two moorings across the shelf at Coffs Harbour in the north of NSW, and a pair of moorings at the Bateman's Marine Park, off Narooma in the south. These moorings will enhance the ANMN coverage along the coast of south-eastern Australia and also provide long term monitoring of the continental shelf region both upstream and downstream of the EAC separation point.",

Its boundaries are generally based on land parcels. A property holding may consist of one or multiple land parcels.\n\nThe Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) is the spatial representation of every current parcel of land in Queensland, and its legal Lot on Plan description and relevant attributes. It provides the map base for systems dealing with land related information. The DCDB is considered to be the point of truth for the graphical representation of property boundaries. It is not the point of truth for the legal property boundary or related attribute information, this will always be the plan of survey or the related titling information and administrative data sets.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps\">riverine flooding</a> in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nSee some <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information\">frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding</a>.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1. Is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.\n 2. Has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses.\n 3. Is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which:\n   - May involve unstable and/or unpredictable variables and is therefore limited in its accuracy and applicability; and,\n   - Will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.\n\n 4. Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n 5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n 6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n\nAccordingly:\n\n 1. While the information presented on this website attempts to represent what may be experienced during a flood, actual flood events may differ substantially.\n\n 2. This website does not provide a forecast or prediction of future flood events or advice or warnings about floods that may occur in the future or their extent or impact.\n\n 3. Any use, reliance, interpretation, copying or reproduction of any information available on this website is at your sole risk and responsibility.\n\n 4. Without limited the previous sentence, to the extent that you use information found on this website to inform insurance or property ownership decisions about a particular property, you do so at your sole risk.\n\n\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory, its agents, officers and employees:\n\n 1.

Accept no responsibility or liability (including without limitation, liability in negligence) for all expenses, loss, damages (including indirect or consequential loss) and costs arising from the use (or misuse) or, or reliance on, the information from this service.\n\n\nThis data shows the level of flooding that can be expected during a major flood event. It identifies which areas may be flooded and the probable depth and relative hazard of the water, right down to individual blocks.\n\n\nThis feature service is derived from flood extent model by removing null cells which are less than 6 sqm in size for display purpose in the ACTmapi's Flood Map.\n\n\nImportant notice\n\nThe riverine flood map information on this website is provided for information purposes only for members of the public. It has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses. It is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the sheep (September joining) model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Long Beach in the east, to Huskisson in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 7 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "The National Reef Monitoring Network brings together shallow reef surveys conducted around Australia into a centralised database. The IMOS National Reef Monitoring Network sub-Facility collates, cleans, stores and makes this data rapidly available from contributors including: Reef Life Survey, Parks Australia, Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia), Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (South Australia), Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales), Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service and Parks Victoria.\n\nThe data provided by the National Reef Monitoring Network contributes to establishing and supporting national marine baselines, and assisting with the management of Commonwealth and State marine reserves. \n\nReef Life Survey (RLS) and the Australian Temperate Reef Network (ATRC) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources by coordinating surveys of rocky and coral reefs using scientific methods, with the ultimate goal to improve coastal stewardship. Our activities depend on the skills of marine scientists, experienced and motivated recreational SCUBA divers, partnerships with management agencies and university researchers, and active input from the ATRC partners and RLS Advisory Committee.\n\nRLS and ATRC data are freely available to the public for non-profit purposes, so not only managers, but also groups such as local dive clubs or schools may use these data to look at changes over time in their own local reefs. By making data freely available and through public outputs, RLS and ATRC aims to raise broader community awareness of the status of Australia's marine biodiversity and associated conservation issues.\n\nThis dataset contains records of cryptobenthic fishes collected by RLS and ATRC divers and partners along 50m transects on shallow rocky and coral reefs using standard methods. Abundance information is available for all species recorded within quantitative survey limits (50 x 1 m swathes either side of the transect line, each distinguished as a 'Block'), with divers searching the reef surface (including cracks) carefully for hidden fishes. These observations are recorded concurrently with the macroinvertebrate observations and together make up the 'Method 2' component of the surveys. For this method, typically one 'Block' is completed per 50 m transect for the program ATRC and 2 blocks are completed for RLS - although exceptions to this rule exist.\n\nThis dataset supersedes the RLS specific \"Reef Life Survey (RLS): Cryptic Fish\" collection that was available at https://catalogue-rls.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?uuid=6a56db3f-d1b2-438d-98c6-bd7dd540a4d5 (provision of data was stopped in June 2021).",

    "description": "The 2014 15 Budget is officially available at [budget.gov.au](http://budget.gov.au \"budget.gov.au\") as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2014 15 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* Selected Tables from the Budget Papers – Available after Budget Papers published on budget.gov.au (~7.30pm Budget night).\r\n* Machine Readable Tables from Budget Papers – Available after Budget Papers published on budget.gov.au (~7.30pm Budget night).\r\n* The Portfolio Budget Statement Excel spreadsheets – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n* A Machine Readable CSV of all PBS Excel Spreadsheet Line Items – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate and translated (~8.30pm Budget night). First version published with 10 portfolios ~8:50pm Budget night. Work due to be competed by midday 14 May 2014.\r\n\r\nData from the 2014-15 Budget are provided to assist those who wish to analyse, visualise and programmatically access the 2014-15 Budget. It is the first time this has been done as per [our announcement blog post] (http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2014/04/24/budget-2014-in-data-form \"Budget 2014 in data form blog post\"). We intend to move further down the digital by default route to make the 2015-16 Budget more accessible and reusable in data form. We welcome your feedback and comments below.  Data users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury. \r\n\r\nInformation about the PBS Excel files and CSV\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes. Only the line item data (table 2.2) is available in CSV at this stage as we thought this would be the most useful PBS data to extract. Much of the other data is also available in the Budget Papers 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Agency Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Agency 2014-15 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.2: Programme Expenses and Programme Components.\r\n* Table 3.1.1: Movement of Administered Funds Between Years;\r\n* Table 3.1.2: Estimates of Special Account Flows and Balances;\r\n* Table 3.1.3: Australian Government Indigenous Expenditure (AGIE);\r\n* Tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.2.7 to 3.2.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the csv file ‘2014-15 PBS line items dataset’ was prepared from individual agency programme expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: estimates of general government expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).  Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.      Intra agency charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements; \r\n\r\n2.      Agency expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n\r\n3.       Additional  agencies’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only agencies that are directly government funded are required to prepare a PBS.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the following Portfolios have contributed their PBS Excel files and are included in the line item CSV: 1.1 Agriculture Portfolio; 1.2 Attorney-General’s Portfolio; 1.3 Communications Portfolio; 1.4A Defence Portfolio; 1.4B Defence Portfolio (Department of Veterans’ Affairs); 1.5 Education Portfolio; 1.6 Employment Portfolio; 1.7 Environment Portfolio; 1.8 Finance Portfolio; 1.9 Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio; 1.10 Health Portfolio; 1.11 Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio; 1.12 Industry Portfolio; 1.13 Infrastructure and Regional Development Portfolio; 1.14 Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio; 1.15A Social Services Portfolio; 1.15B Social Services Portfolio (Department of Human Services); 1.16 Treasury Portfolio; 1.17A Department of the House of Representatives; 1.17B Department of the Senate; 1.17C Department of Parliamentary Services; and 1.17D Department of the Parliamentary Budget Office.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by agency and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV as these can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required. If a corrigendum to an agencies PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary. \r\n\r\nBelow is the CSV structure of the line item CSV. The data transformation is expected to be complete by midday 14 May, so we have put up the incomplete CSV which will be updated as additional PBSs are transformed into data form. Please keep refreshing for now.\r\n\r\nPortfolio, Department/Agency, Outcome, Program, Expense type, Appropriation type, Description, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, Source document, Source table, URL\r\n\r\nBudget Paper Tables\r\n--------------------------\r\nWe have made a number of data tables from Budget Papers 1 and 4 available in their original format as Excel or XML files.

    "description": "This dataset contains a false color aerial image mosaic of the City of Melbourne municipal area. False color images render the scene in other colors not seen by the human eye. It is used for the interpretation of natural resources. \n\nThe red tone of the aerial image is associated with live vegetation. Intense reds indicate vegetation which is growing vigorously and quite dense. This image is contains embedded georeferenced information.\n\nCapture Information:\n- Capture Date: 2nd/3rd February 2019\n- Capture Pixel Size: 5cm\n- Map Projection: MGA Zone 55 (MGA55)\n\nAdditional technical information:\nArborCarbon collected high resolution multispectral imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. ArborCarbon have used this multispectral image to create this seamless 20cm false-colour composite showing variation in vegetation condition.\n\nThe multispectral imagery was acquired at 8,000ft above ground level over the City of Melbourne under cloudless conditions between 09:45 and 12:45 on 2nd and 3rd February 2019. \n\nImagery was acquired with the ArborCam system with a ground sample distance ranging from 6 cm/pixel to 25 cm/pixel dependent on the band. Imagery was comprised of 3 broad bands in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and an additional 7 narrow-bands strategically positioned in the visible and near infra-red regions to detect subtle variations and changes in vegetation condition.\nPreview Image:\nSee an example image showing the data quality of the aerial.\n\nDownload TIF: \nDownload file (2GB)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of employed ophthalmologists and full-time equivalent (FTE) per 100,000 population. The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWD). The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), in conjunction with the national health professional registration boards, is responsible for the national registration process for 14 health professions. The data from the annual registration process, together with data from a workforce survey that is voluntarily completed at the time of registration, form the Department of Health’s National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWDS). Data in the NHWDS includes demographic and employment information (for example, labour force status, location of main job, area of practice, work setting) for registered health professionals. In this report, the data on optometrists and ophthalmologists comes from the NHWDS as reported by AIHW.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nFTE is a measure calculated by dividing an estimate of the total hours worked by employees in an occupation in a week by an estimate of the standard hours worked for optometrists (38 hours per week). The number of FTE is then compared with the size of relevant population to get the FTE 100,000 population.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n",

    "title": "TRIAP Franklin 2008 Waterbirds",
    "description": "1) As part of the Tropical Rivers Inventory and Assessment Project (TRIAP), a database of 94,148 waterbird records was assembled, comprising 82,596 records from the TRIAP area and 11,552 records from a surrounding 10 km buffer. These records were sourced from databases for Atlas1 and Atlas2 provided by Birds Australia, 99.1% of which are from the Historical Atlas (pre-1977), the first Field Atlas (1977-1981) or the second Field Atlas (1997-2002).\r\n2) Waterbirds were defined to include species of freshwater and coastal wetlands including in-shore but not off-shore marine species. The TRIAP waterbird fauna comprises 145 species from twenty families, of which 112 species are represented in the database by more than ten records.\r\n3) One TRIAP waterbird species – the Australian Painted Snipe – is listed as threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). Eighty-seven species are listed as \"migratory\" under the EPBCA, 44 species are listed under the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement and 53 species under the China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement. The geographical characteristics of all listed species are summarised for the TRIAP area.\r\n4) In the TRIAP area, the Australian Painted Snipe is an infrequent visitor or perhaps rare resident found more frequently in the more arid south. Its preferred habitat of ephemeral wetlands with a mix of mud-flats and dense low vegetation does not closely match habitats recorded for the species in the TRIAP area, which may reflect the marginal nature of its occurrence in this area. Breeding records in the TRIAP area have been in flooded grasslands.\r\n5) A foraging guild classification based on a classification of foraging substrate, foraging methods and food types is presented in this dataset. Twelve foraging guilds are recognised as occurring in the TRIAP area.\r\n6) No waterbirds are endemic to the TRIAP area. However, the TRIAP area represents a major proportion of the range of the Chestnut Rail, and a major proportion of the Australian range of the Great-billed Heron.\r\n7) A biogeographic classification of TRIAP waterbirds is developed based on breeding distributions. Four classes are recognised: a. species for whom TRIAP is a core breeding area; b. Australasian species for whom TRIAP is marginal to their main distribution; c. Palaearctic / Nearctic migrants – these do not breed in Australia; and d. Non-migratory species with a distribution centre in Asia, or Malaysia including New Guinea. Few species other than vagrants have restricted ranges within the TRIAP area, but there is a weak declining gradient in species richness from east to west.\r\n8) The distribution of waterbird families, foraging guilds and threatened species were compared qualitatively with a 1:250 000 classification of waterbodies into seven units. Although the results are \"noisy\", groups associated with deep water and saline habitats were clearly identifiable. A geomorphic classification of rivers provides only linear data and poor spatial correspondence with waterbird records. Neither classification provides a direct measure of the wetland features most relevant to most species, and whilst quantitative analysis could be pursued, it appears unlikely to identify many definitive habitat relationships.\r\nSee Table 6, section 3.3 of (Franklin 2008) for an explanation of foraging guilds. Note that \"herbivore\" includes the possibility of also being extensively insectivorous, whereas \"insectivore\" implies that herbivory is not a major component of the diet.\r\nSee lineage for more details or refer to: \r\nFranklin DC. 2008.
