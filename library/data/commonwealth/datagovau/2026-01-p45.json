    "description": "The Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions dataset is maintained for the purpose of authoritative reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries. \n\nThe 2016 version 2 updates the marine portion of the NRM regions to be consistent with the current (2015) Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System (AMBIS) coastal water limit boundary. It also includes a new unique ID field for sorting purposes (this is explained in detail below). Three NRM names have also been updated as a result of new information from relevant state/territory agencies and/or NRM regional bodies, as follows: \n\n1. “Avon” changed to “Wheatbelt”\n2. “North West” changed to “Cradle Coast”\n\nThe 2016 version 2 maintains definitions established in the 2015 version, including for the Peel-Harvey NRM region and for the OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation (not spatially defined). It also maintains changes made in earlier versions including: the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas; and the 2012 update/formalisation of the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset. \n\nWhilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\n\nIn total, this dataset now represents 61 NRM regions, two of which have large and remote islands which are distinguished in the spatial data, resulting in 63 map objects. The 61 NRM regions comprise 56 mainland regions administered by 55 NRM regional bodies (the Cooperative Management Area in QLD is jointly administered by the two adjacent regional bodies: the Cape York and Northern Gulf NRM bodies) and seven islands (five administered by the Australian Government as external territories, and two administered by nearby mainland NRM regional bodies, which are shown as separate map objects).\n\nThe 2016 version 2 includes a new unique ID field in the table structure to allow for sorting based on state, region name and region object (where there is more than one part). The following list of regions includes the new NRM_ID field as a reference:\n\nNew South Wales\t\n1010\tCentral Tablelands\n1020\tCentral West\n1030\tGreater Sydney\n1040\tHunter\n1050\tMurray\n1060\tNorth Coast (excluding Lord Howe Island)\n1061\tNorth Coast - Lord Howe Island\n1070\tNorth West NSW\n1080\tNorthern Tablelands\n1090\tRiverina\n1100\tSouth East NSW\n1110\tWestern\n\nVictoria\t\n2010\tCorangamite\n2020\tEast Gippsland\n2030\tGlenelg Hopkins\n2040\tGoulburn Broken\n2050\tMallee\n2060\tNorth Central\n2070\tNorth East\n2080\tPort Phillip and Western Port\n2090\tWest Gippsland \n2100\tWimmera\n\nQueensland\t\n3010\tBurnett Mary\n3020\tCape York\n3030\tCondamine\n3040\tCooperative Management Area (administered jointly by Cape York and Northern Gulf)\n3050\tDesert Channels\n3060\tFitzroy \n3070\tBurdekin\n3080\tNorthern Gulf\n3090\tBorder Rivers Maranoa-Balonne\n3100\tMackay Whitsunday\n3110\tSouth East Queensland\n3120\tSouth West Queensland\n3130\tSouthern Gulf\n3140\tWet Tropics\n3150\tTorres Strait\n\nSouth Australia\t\n4010\tAdelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges\n4020\tAlinytjara Wilurara\n4030\tEyre Peninsula\n4040\tKangaroo Island\n4050\tNorthern and Yorke\n4060\tSouth Australian Arid Lands\n4070\tSouth Australian Murray Darling Basin\n4080\tSouth East\n\nWestern Australia\t\n5010\tNorthern Agricultural\n5020\tPeel-Harvey\n5030\tPerth\n5040\tRangelands\n5050\tSouth Coast\n5060\tSouth West\n5070\tWheatbelt\n\nTasmania\t\n6010\tCradle Coast\n6020\tNorth\n6030\tSouth (excluding Macquarie Islands)\n6031\tSouth - Macquarie Islands\n\nNorthern Territory\t\n7010\tNorthern Territory\n\nAustralian Capital Territory\t\n8010\tACT\n\nExternal Territories \t\n9010\tAshmore and Cartier Islands\n9020\tChristmas Island\n9030\tCocos Keeling Islands\n9040\tHeard and McDonald Islands\n9050\tNorfolk IslandData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment) 2015",

    "description": "Long-term annual monitoring of Ruppia tuberosa in the Southern Coorong in South Australia is undertaken by the University of Adelaide. The monitoring commenced in 1998 focusing on winter sampling, and it was extended in 2013 to include summer sampling.\r\nR. tuberosa is a native submerged aquatic plant, commonly known as tuberous sea tassel. It provides habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates, fish and herbivorous waterbirds in the Coorong. The LLCMM region, which includes the Coorong, is a Ramsar-listed wetland of international importance. It is also one of the icon sites under The Living Murray program. The condition of the LLCMM region, and aquatic native vegetation recruitment and populations, have been identified as targets against which to assess progress towards achieving the objectives of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The Ruppia monitoring data and findings form part of the ecological information used for this assessment.\r\nThe 2016-17 monitoring program was funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA). Prior to 2016-17, the program was funded by the MDBA, South Australia’s Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR), Earthwatch Australia and the University of Adelaide in different years\r\nThe MDBA has made the R. tuberosa database and related resources publicly available on data.gov.au as part of its commitment to the Australian Government policy on public data and information. The terms and conditions for using the data and related resources from this website can be found at https://www.data.gov.au/about.\r\n  \r\n",

The data is available on data.gov.au.\nThe dataset was further analysed and masked to exclude non-forest areas and create a forest extent layer with a 20 percent canopy cover for the NSW UTM Zones 55 &amp; 56. The mask layer includes various datasets such as NSW Land use 2017, State Vegetation Type map (SVTM), Land Zoning, Water body, etc. The DPIRD Plantation unit's Authorised plantation layer (current as Aug 2024) was used to characterise forest types, i.e. Native forest and Plantation.

The overall goal of this project will be to assess larval dispersal patterns, demographic connectivity and levels of recruitment subsidies from green zones at a regional scale. Tasks include:\n\n1. Collect tissue samples from adult and juvenile coral trout, develop a new set of hyper-variable microsatellite markers, conduct DNA genotyping analyses of all samples, carry out genetic parentage analysis to examine parent-offspring relationships.\n\n2. Refine the existing biophysical model and assess likely origins of larvae at key recruitment hot spots in the region.\n\n3. Undertake demographic metapopulation analyses using dispersal distances and trajectories derived from this study and available demographic data (growth, natural mortality, fishing mortality) to evaluate long-term persistence of green zone and blue zone populations under different levels of fishing pressure and habitat condition.",

    "description": "A water allocation is the percentage of a licensed water user’s entitlement that is credited to their water account for use. We announce allocations each year on 1 July and regularly thereafter until all licence categories in a water source are fully allocated.\n\nWe allocate water using water sharing plans to ensure long-term water security and prioritised access to water across NSW. Allocations vary based on the water available in dams, river flows, and the prevailing catchment and weather conditions. In formal terms, allocations are sometimes known as Available Water Determinations.\n\nA detailed description of the AWD process is provided on the DPE-Water website and can be accessed <a href=\"https://water.dpie.nsw.gov.au/our-work/allocations-availability/allocations/how-water-is-allocated\">here.</a>\n\nThe AWD for Supplementary licence accounts is a separate process and is not dependent on the water available. It is made once at the start of the year and unless there is a management change because of the growth in use strategy, it is maintained at the maximum value prescribed in the plan, which is generally 1 megalitre per share (equivalent to 100% of entitlement). \n\n\n\n<strong>Notes</strong>\n<em>1. This dataset is included in the General Purpose Water Accounting Reports: https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-general-purpose-water-accounting-reports</em>\n\n<em>2. If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.</em>",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2012, in waters off South Australia. \n\n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "The Stream Metabolism and Water Quality Basin Matter seeks to evaluate the influence of Commonwealth environmental water on two key ecological processes—primary production and decomposition—which have a profound effect on ecosystem character and condition. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project examined the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and assisted the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nStream metabolism data was collected over the duration of the LTIM Project from 2014-15 to 2018-19 in six Selected Areas* (Edward/Kolety-Wakool, Lachlan, Goulburn, Murrumbidgee, Warrego-Darling and Lower Murray).\r\n\r\n*Stream metabolism is not a Category 1 indicator in the Gwydir Selected Area.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Stream Metabolism and Water Quality Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We thank them for their knowledge and science and respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n",

The assessment uses the adopted hydrologic and hydraulic models for the catchment from  ‘Wianamatta South Creek Catchment Flood Study – Existing Conditions’ (Revision I, Advisian 2022) to define contemporary flood characteristics and to test a range of development and floodplain modification scenarios.\n\nThe assessment:\n- highlights the critical importance of maintaining areas of flow conveyance and flood storage. \n- developed mapping of the areas critical to the conveyance of floods that should not be disturbed or too heavily vegetated \n- provides a list of recommendations that are considered essential for mitigating the cumulative impacts of potential future development in the Wianamatta South Creek Catchment",

The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

This data has been superseded by NSW Positioning Theme Survey Mark GDA2020 multiCRS or NSW Positioning Theme - Survey Mark GDA2020.\nPlease Note:WGS 84 service aligned to GDA94This dataset has spatial reference [WGS 84 ≈ GDA94] which may result in misalignments when viewed in GDA2020 environments. A similar service with a ‘multiCRS’ suffix is available which can support GDA2020, GDA94 and WGS 84 ≈ GDA2020 environments.In due course, and allowing time for user feedback and testing, it is intended that the original service name will adopt the new multiCRS functionally.\n\n\nPlease note that SCIMS Online is the official option for obtaining state control survey data for cadastral surveys as it offers legal traceability. SCIMS online is accessible via the Spatial portal.\n\n\nMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleNSW Positioning Theme - Survey Mark GDA94Content TypeHosted Feature LayerDescriptionThe NSW Survey Marks web service is a dynamic map of permanent survey marks that constitute the state control survey. The positioning data under the NSW Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF) is fed to the web service by the Survey Control Information Management System (SCIMS), the database that contains the single source of truth for all marks within the state control survey network.This service provides GDA94 coordinates, heights and related information for NSW survey marks that form the official State control survey network (as reported in SCIMS). This service controls the precision of numerical output in a manner that mirrors SCIMS Online available through the Spatial Services Portal.The web service provides a wealth of data on each mark, including:Mark type (Permanent Mark, State Survey Mark, etc.) Mark number Horizontal coordinates and their accuracy (class and order) Heights and their accuracy (class and order) Status of the mark (destroyed, restricted access, etc.) The Mark type is represented using various shapes and the accuracy of the mark (both vertical and horizontal) is communicated by the colour. This web service allows users to easily integrate survey control mark data from SCIMS into Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant spatial platforms and applications. Data provided by the NSW Survey Mark web service can be used in a variety of engineering and surveying applications, including but not limited to: Cadastral survey planning Flood studies and hydrographic modelling Infrastructure developmentSite calibration at construction sites Elevation modelling Preservation of survey infrastructureThe NSW Survey Mark web service gives users an alternative method to access state control survey data that can be incorporated into their GIS package without needing to log into SCIMS Online.Please note that SCIMS Online is the official option for obtaining state control survey data for cadastral surveys as it offers legal traceability.

The survey also provides City of Ballarat with a means to fulfil some of its statutory reporting requirements as well as acting as a feedback mechanism to LGV.\r\n\r\nResults from the annual Ballarat Community Satisfaction / Perceptions Survey. \r\n\r\nAlthough all due care has been taken to ensure that these data are correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by the City of Ballarat in their use.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a04.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "The Flow-MER research project identification and characterisation of refuge habitat research project applied systematic conservation planning using MARXAN to identify wetlands in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB ) that may act as climate refugia.  Refuge habitats were identified as wetlands with the least deviation in water levels, that were the most feasible to manage and could supported target species, ecosystems and functions.  MARXAN uses a simulated annealing algorithm to identify a set of planning units that maximises the representation of ecological asset, while aiming to capture a defined target for each asset and minimise ‘cost’. The ‘cost’ of a planning unit was weighted by its capacity to act as a refuge (dryness anomaly), catchment condition and connectivity (River Disturbance Index) and management feasibility (previous environmental water delivery).\r\n\r\nThe two data tables join to the Australian National Aquatic Ecosystems (ANAE) v3.0 Classification of the Murray-Darling Basin (2021)  using the mapped wetland polygon UID attribute.\r\n1.\tmarxan_cost_managable_floodplain.csv contains MARXAN cost values and final solution set for all lakes and palustrine wetland within scope for water management (on the managed floodplain) in the MDB.\r\n2.\tmarxan_cost_wetlands_water_mgmnt_2014-2020.csv contains the MARXAN attributes and solution for the subset of wetlands that have previously received Commonwealth environmental water during the 6 year period 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings.\r\n\r\nWetlands and lakes are refuges for plants and animals during droughts and other hard times. Maintaining refugia in the Murray–Darling Basin is a key objective of Commonwealth environmental water management.\r\n\r\n### Project Report\r\nBennett J M, Brooks S, Bush A, Hitchcock J, Linke S (2023) Identifying and characterising refugia habitat for target organisms across the Murray–Darling Basin.

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Darwin for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "__Note: This dataset has been superseded by the__ _Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities - Update December 2023_ available at https://doi.org/10.25814/zfjz-jt75.\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2020 dataset shows the location and extent of select agricultural, mining and forest product commodities, where mapped. This dataset replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2018 version 2 released on 26 November 2019. This dataset is the third national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at December 2020. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). The commodities data complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020 dataset (ABARES 2021).\r\n\r\n##What’s new?##\r\nThe following areas have updated mapping since the December 2018 version 2: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nMore detail has been added in the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory (2016).\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUMC datasets in their databases.\r\n\r\n##Citation##\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "This dataset presents projected household size for 5-year periods between the years of 2011 and 2036 for the state of New South Wales (NSW). The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nHousehold projections show the number of households that would form if demographic trends continue and if assumptions about living arrangements are realised over the projection period. A household is two or more people who share a dwelling (house, apartment, townhouse, caravan, etc.) and share food and cooking facilities, and other essentials. Household projections show the future number and type of households living in private dwellings. Private dwellings are self-contained accommodation such as houses, apartments, mobile homes or other substantial structures. It does not include accommodation such as boarding houses, nursing homes or prisons.\nThe household projections also include the implied dwelling demand for those households.  This is the likely number of private dwellings needed to accommodate future population-driven demand.\nFor more information please read the Household Projections User Guide.Please note: \n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "    \n\nData provided are the scale of polygonal datasources used to generate the\npolygon derived surfaces for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.\nData modelled from area based observations made by State soil agencies.The\nfinal ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic of all of the data\nobtained from various state and federal agencies. The surfaces have been\nconstructed with the best available soil survey information available at the\ntime. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One being that an\narea weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for that polygon\nor mapunit. Another assumption made is that the lookup tables provided by\nMcKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict the soil\nattribute values for each soil type.The accuracy of the maps is most dependent\non the scale of the original polygon data sets and the level of soil survey\nthat has taken place in each state. The scale of the various soil maps used in\nderiving this map is available by accessing darasource grid, the scale is used\nas an assessment of the likely accuracy of the modelling.The Atlas of\nAustralian Soils is considered to be the least accurate dataset and has\ntherefore only been used where there is no state based data.Of the state\ndatasets Western Australian sub-systems, South Australian land systems and NSW\nsoil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping would be the most reliable based on\nscale. NSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping however, may be less\naccurate than South Australia and Western Australia as only one dominant soil\ntype per polygon was used in the estimation of attributes, compared to several\nsoil types per polygon or mapunit in South Australia and Western Australia.\nNSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping as the name suggests is\nreconnaissance level only with no laboratory data. The digital map data is\nprovided in geographical coordinates based on the World Geodetic System 1984\n(WGS84) datum.\n\nSee [further metadat](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dams_r9cl_\n_04011a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe site is classified as box woodland, dominated by two main eucalypt species: <em>Eucalyptus microcarpa</em> (grey box) and <em>Eucalyptus leucoxylon</em> (yellow gum). The site has an elevation of 165&nbsp;m. Mean annual precipitation measured by the nearby Bureau of Meteorology site is 558&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 12.6&nbsp;°C (in July) to 29.8&nbsp;°C (in January), while minimum temperatures range from 3.2&nbsp;°C (in July) to 14.2&nbsp;°C (in February). Maximum temperatures vary on a seasonal basis by approximately 17.2&nbsp;°C and minimum temperatures by 11.0&nbsp;°C.\n\nThe instrument mast is 36&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.",

A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n The report presents results and analysis from a national survey of Australian sheep and cattle landholders in late 2014, in areas affected by wild dogs. The results are combined with data from a similar 2010 survey to assess longitudinal changes in wild dog impacts and management activities. \r\n\r\n Topics cover landholders' perspectives on wild dog problem severity and distribution, personal and economic impacts and collective management actions. The study also quantifies factors that influence the effectiveness of wild dog management groups and their achievement of outcomes. Around 1010 landholders participated in the 2014 survey. \r\n\r\n This study is the final phase in an ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n",

    "description": "The Joseph Bonaparte Gulf survey (SOL5117, GA survey #0325) was conducted on the R.V. Solander between 30 July and 30 September 2010 in collaboration with staff from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Museum and Art Gallery of Territory (MAGNT). This was a follow up survey from a survey in 2009 (SOL4934, GA survey #0322). The SOL5117 survey was undertaken under a Collaborative Agreement between GA and the AIMS. SOL5117 survey collected acoustic multibeam data (bathymetry and backscatter), sub-bottom profile data, as well as detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical) and biological (towed-video, benthic sled, Smith McIntyre grabs) data for seabed environments (banks, channels and plains) from 4 offshore grids along a N-S transect.  In addition, shipboard photographs were taken of barcoded biological specimens. The aims of the survey were to map, identify and investigate potential geohazards and unique, sensitive environments that relate to infrastructure; and to use exisitng data to evaluate the capacity to predict geohazards and sensitive environments.\n\nUnderwater video footage and still photographc images (12 megapixel resolution) from towed-video were collected from 46 (Leg 1) and 33 (Leg 2) stations, although quality varies among transects and some still images were not of suitable quality for analysis. Video and image files or associated parent folders are named by station number, gear code (CAM = underwater camera system) and then the deployment number. For example, 'stn48CAM35' would represent a video transect from Station 48 that was the 35th video transect on the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2012 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

Diversity percentages are based on total ACTPS headcount which assumes that all respondents do not identify as one or more of the diversity groups, which is likely to result in under-reporting of the actual proportion of diversity groups in the ACTPS.\nDiversity statistics are also provided in Annual Reports and monitored through the ACTPS Respect, Equity and Diversity Framework.  Workforce data in this section has been presented in a way that protects the identity of individual employees. \n\nNote on Averages: Salary averages here are inclusive of part-time and casual employees. \n\nPlease see the attached document for additional notes.\n\n[State of the Service 2012]",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) R.V. Aurora Australis collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 30 minutes. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC09) was collected from a depth of 166m within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. This assembly of information suggests that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~60cm depth, with one indicator being the increase in fine grain material (<100µm). The results also indicate fine grain dominance at a depth of 90cm.",

    "description": "The 2023-24 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2023-24 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2023-24 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers (No.1) and (No.4) in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2023-24 Budget Measures\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2023-24 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1. Intra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements\r\n2. Entity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements and\r\n3. Additional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2022-23\r\n* 2023-24\r\n* 2024-25\r\n* 2025-26\r\n* 2026-27\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry\r\n* Attorney-General's\r\n* Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education\r\n* Employment and Workplace Relations\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health and Aged Care\r\n* Home Affairs\r\n* Industry, Science and Resources\r\n* Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook and Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing are included for reference as well.",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

These plans are also a component of Water Resources Plans prepared as a requirement of the Basin Plan 2012, covering water sources in the Murray-Darling Basin.WSP's are reviewed and replaced periodically (usually every ten years) to ensure the long-term health of ecosystems and communities in specific WSP areas. The review of a WSP includes a formal evaluation to assess appropriateness, efficiency of implementation, effectiveness in meeting plan objectives, and alignment with the Act's requirements.The evaluation follows a step-by-step process which includes a model scenario to represent the effects of Planned Environmental Water (PEW) rules in the WSP.This high-level (\"No PEW\") scenario enables a comparison of modelled flows at key locations within the river system between scenarios WITH and WITHOUT plan environmental rules to inform an assessment of the effectiveness of the PEW rules in the WSP.For information about this feature class please see WATER MODELLING-ModelledData-NoPEW page in SEED website.\nPrevious SEED service moved from 10.7 to 11. 1 Portal.

These patterns can be relevant to deforestation, habitat loss and environment-wildlife-human interactions at a range of landscape scales. Users define their landscape using polygons or points as either shapefile or csv, and select relevant metrics at patch, class or landscape level.  Results calculated by the tool can be viewed interactively using both the table and map in the application or downloaded as a text file for further analysis.   The application uses the 10m Indonesian Hybrid Landcover 2020 - GeoTIFF and Hosted Tile Layer, derived from open source data products (i) ESRI 2020 Landcover, (ii) Global industrial and smallholder oil palm, (iii) Global Human Settlement  and (iv) Open Street Map.

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:3857WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "title": "Water current readings from the North East mooring in Jervis Bay (off Green Point): 11/07/90 - 29/08/90",
    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0305S, 150.756E) between 11/07/90 and 29/08/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\n**Users should be aware that there appears to be some data corruption in the later stages of the datasets collected from 11.5m. In addition to this corruption, the decimated hourly dataset relating to the meter at 5.5m is unfortunately missing**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

In excess of 100,000 cuttlefish aggregate in this area each year to spawn.  The AUV spent one week following the Sir Joseph Banks trip being deployed at night in the shallow waters around these spawning grounds.  In all, 35 dives were completed over a 6 day/night period.  These short dives allowed the AUV to operate in very shallow waters where the cuttlefish are known to aggregate.\n\nThe dive reports from this campaign summarise AUV activity during each dive. Data for this campaign will soon be available.",

    "description": "Turtles that are collected in traps and fyke nets are identified to species and individually measured (shell size) and weighed. Turtle sampling in Flow-MER is not comprehensive and these data provide a record of presence rather than abundance. Some records will be turtles caught as by-catch in fyke nets set that were set in habitats to catch fish and not from sampling for turtles specifically.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWO (2024) Turtle measurements.

    "description": "Utilities data were supplied to Geoscience Australia by Gutteridge Haskins &amp; Davey Pty Ltd (GHD) on 25th May 2001. Utilities data supplied included fuel related infrastructure. GHD compiled the utilities data from original CAD drawings collected over many years through management of island infrastructure by the Commonwealth Department of Administrative Services. The CAD drawings were converted into ESRI shapefiles by GHD.\nIn 2006 GHD updated several of the 2001 utilities shapefiles.\nUtilities for the airport, which previously only contained data in the water supply layer, were received from the Indian Ocean Territories Administration (Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities) in January 2013. The new data was provided as dng cad file and included fuel, which was added to the relevant layers.  However the data did not include fuel tanks.\nData indicative only and not to be relied on.  Data may not include most recent changes.\nDisclaimer",

The data is based on 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp. Other Territories (LGA code 99399) were split across two records in the original data, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2011 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The resource provides information on the rates of growth, competitive ability and life spans of species in the epifaunal community at Portsea.\n \nEstimates of rates of growth for all species were collected from panels immersed on 16/11/1977 except for the common barnacle (Elminius modestus) and ascidian (Didemnum augusti) which were collected from panels immersed on 24/10/1975. Length and average width of colonies or individuals and maximum height of arborescent bryozoans were made at regular intervals during the time of immersion. Colonial ascidians were the most rapid occupiers of space. In general, colonial ascidians and sponges attained a larger size and occupied space more rapidly than encrusting bryozoans. \n\nCompetitive interactions between species were examined using the same panels as described in the record 'Patterns of development in the epifaunal community at Portsea, Victoria' (File identifier: a88f2d70-ebf6-11dc-a93a-00188b4c0af8). These panels had been immersed for 2 to 42 months and fixed in formalin-sea water solution. Approximately 5500 interactions were recorded between 52 species. An interaction was defined as the overgrowth or smothering of an organism by another organism of the same or different species. For each interaction the species involved were identified, the sizes of the interacting organisms were measured and the percentage of overgrowth, if any, was estimated visually in increments of 5% overgrowth of the colony or individual. There was no single competitively dominant species in the marine epifaunal community at Portsea. The competitive ability of a species depended on the rate of growth of the species and the maximum size they could attain. The relative size of interacting colonies was often important in determining the outcome of an interaction with larger colony generally winning. \n\nThe maximum life span for each species was estimated from observations of communities on panels and on pier pilings over the 4 year period of the study (October 1975 to November 1979). The life spans of the major groups of epifauna on panesl at Portsea followed the order sponges (>24 months) > ascidians (~ 12 - 20 months) > bryozoans (~ 8 - 20 months) > barnacles, polychaetes, tubicolous amphipods and hydroids (4 - 12 months).",

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital polygon/point coverage of lakes and ponds identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface lake features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each lake/pond is represented as a polygon with a central point label which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles  within the Windmill Islands.",

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\nJP – 2090 RCP 8.5 - Juvenile period as years until 50% of individuals in the population have \nflowered under future conditions (30-year period centred on 2090) with the RCP 8.5 emissions \nscenario based on a model featuring annual precipitation.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Kingfish model in the Marine Fisheries node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.\nMaps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the five global climate models (GCMs) used for the Marine Fisheries node, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the sheep (June joining) model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP for urgent medical care in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nShort description: A network of natural and semi-natural areas which support critical ecosystem services, including connected native species habitats, and which provide for implementation of living infrastructure, active travel, climate adaptation and community wellbeing outcomes. An output of the Connecting Nature, Connecting People program, developed to guide land use and management decisions.\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\nMETHODS\nData collection / creation: The ecological network was initially derived from potential habitat and connectivity model outputs for grassland, woodland and aquatic-riparian ecosystems. These model outputs indicate potential habitat areas, fragmentation and whether a patch is big enough to provide core or corridor habitat functions for specific taxa groups. The network was created by identifying key patches of core habitat and corridors, as well as missing links that could reconnect fragmented patches. These were reviewed by several ecologists until the proposed network was agreed upon.\nThese agreed areas were converted to spatial data. Polygons were drawn around the relevant potential habitat and connectivity model outputs to simplify the data and visualise connections between habitat patches. The output was overlaid over other environmental data, including sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways and many more. Boundaries were adjusted to reflect these values as needed.\nThe ecological network was reviewed by subject matter experts and tested in a draft policy document released for public comment. Further revisions to boundaries were made following feedback. The final layer was dissolved and checked for geometry issues. \nNOTES ON USE\nQuality: The network considers an abundance and variety of datasets, including protected areas, potential habitat and connectivity maps, distribution of sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways, restoration projects, urban open spaces and community sites. Data was sourced from authoritative sources where possible. The network was verified and refined through wide distribution and review of the draft dataset, including by ACT Government ecologists and community members. Where possible, polygon boundaries were drawn around existing features (such as lakes or mapped habitat). Polygons were checked against the most recent aerial imagery to verify values and boundaries. This broad review of existing data and consultation on the output provides confidence the output represents the extent of our collective knowledge and provides a holistic illustration of known values.\nLimitations: The urban ACT Ecological network is a concept only. Polygon boundaries are hand drawn and imprecise. The data has not been ground-truthed. Boundaries should be considered approximate and verified with additional data and ground surveys. Further, the network does not assess feasibility or priorities. It does not consider species presence or absence, habitat condition, management regimes or tenure. This information should be gathered for decision making by referring to other environmental datasets, undertaking ground surveys and consulting with subject matter experts. \nData refinement: The dataset could be further improved by testing corridors against a feasibility ruleset (e.g. distance between core patches, width). Additionally, future research may support a wider range of uses by adopting a more technical approach to establish polygon boundaries or areas of interest. This would support higher spatial accuracy and enable greater certainty on what areas are within the network. A quantitative approach could support spatial statistics to aid decision making, e.g. through the ability to prioritise corridors. The Least-Cost Pathway Method is recommended for further study.\nSHARING\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

A state electoral district is an area legally prescribed for the purpose of returning one or more members to the State or Territory Lower Houses of Parliament, or the relevant equivalent. Boundaries are based on the most up to date state electoral districts available prior to publication. State Electoral Divisions may change as State or Territory authorities revise their boundaries. Where this occurs, State Electoral Divisions will be updated on an annual basis in conjunction with updates of other Non ABS Structures. Please note that ABS approximated boundaries do not match official legal or administrative boundaries and should only be used for statistical purposes. Further information about these regions can be found in the following publication: Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0623S, 150.7672E) between 13/9/90 and 30/10/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nUsers should be aware that there appears to be some distortion of data within these files. For example, the depth data recorded by the meter maintained around 11.5m produced negative values and also readings of 132m! Salinity readings from the 5.5m current meter are also missing for the start of the record.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 5.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Modelling of landscape capacity for 75 landscape-managed NSW threatened species. \n\nLandscape capacity is a measure of how usable habitat is for supporting populations based on the quality of habitat and how easily species can move across the landscape to access sufficient resources to support a population. This project maps climate-informed landscape capacity. This mapping shows how well NSW landscapes can support fauna populations into future climate. The location of climate refugia are identified. These are areas that support species populations through time, from pre-industrial times and into the future.\n\nThe methods and descriptions of outputs are provided in the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/persistence-landscapes-project\">project report</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/d44cb0df-0242-4db3-9126-8c26aba7f80a/resource/27c36e75-690e-4fcd-88b4-b89bbdfafeba/download/plp_reportcards_final2025.pdf\">Two page species forecasts</a> summarise results for each species. \n\nEach species model is projected into NARCliM (v1.0) climate futures. The dataset comprises: individual models for 1750, 2000, 2030 and 2070 epochs; 'consensus' maps across 12 climate models for 2070; and multi-species refugia and landscape capacity across time maps (<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/edf6e375-57c5-4f55-93f0-422a0af1900c\">for the 75 threatened species</a>, and also including site-managed species <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/c76d5cd9-b3d1-4622-a4d5-55aed553e38b\">here</a>). \n\nThe individual species geotiff files are grouped into zip files which are large and may take considerable time to download.\n\nThese resources are outputs of the Persistence in the Landscape Project (PLP). \n\nThis item contains landscape capacity rasters for the following species, for pre-industrial (1750), 2000, 2030 and 2070, based on NARCliM 1.0 projections:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Artamus cyanopterus cyanopterus</em>,    <strong>Dusky Woodswallow</strong></li>\n<li><em>Atrichornis rufescens</em>,  <strong>Rufous Scrub-bird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Botaurus poiciloptilus</em>, <strong>Australasian Bittern</strong></li>\n<li><em>Burhinus grallarius</em>,    <strong>Bush Stone-curlew</strong></li>\n<li><em>Callocephalon fimbriatum</em>, <strong>Gang-gang Cockatoo</strong></li>\n<li><em>Calyptorhynchus banksii samueli</em>, <strong>Red-tailed Black-Cockatoo</strong> (inland subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Calyptorhynchus lathami</em>, <strong>South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo</strong>- updated to <em>Calyptorhynchus lathami lathami</em> in the report</li>\n<li><em>Certhionyx variegatus</em>, <strong>Pied Honeyeater</strong></li>\n<li><em>Chthonicola sagittata</em>, <strong>Speckled Warbler</strong> - updated to <em>Pyrrholaemus sagittatus</em> in the report</li>\n<li><em>Cinclosoma castanotum</em>, <strong>Chestnut Quail-thrush</strong></li>\n<li><em>Circus assimilis</em>, <strong>Spotted Harrier</strong></li>\n<li><em>Climacteris picumnus victoriae</em>, <strong>Brown Treecreeper</strong> (eastern subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Coracina lineata</em>, <strong>Barred Cuckoo-shrike</strong></li>\n<li><em>Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni</em>, <strong>Coxen's Fig-Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Daphoenositta chrysoptera</em>, <strong>Varied Sittella</strong></li>\n<li><em>Dasyornis brachypterus</em>, <strong>Eastern Bristlebird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Glossopsitta pusilla</em>, <strong>Little Lorikeet</strong> - updated to <em>Parvipsitta pusilla</em> in the report </li>\n<li><em>Grantiella picta</em>, <strong>Painted Honeyeater</strong></li>\n<li><em>Hieraaetus morphnoides</em>, <strong>Little Eagle</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ixobrychus flavicollis</em>, <strong>Black Bittern</strong></li>\n<li><em>Lathamus discolor</em>, <strong>Swift Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Lophochroa leadbeateri</em>, <strong>Pink Cockatoo</strong></li>\n<li><em>Melanodryas cucullata cucullata</em>, <strong>Hooded Robin</strong> (south-eastern form)</li>\n<li><em>Melithreptus gularis gularis</em>, <strong>Black-chinned Honeyeater</strong> (eastern subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Menura alberti</em>, <strong>Albert's Lyrebird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Neophema pulchella</em>, <strong>Turquoise Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ninox connivens</em>, <strong>Barking Owl</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ninox strenua</em>, <strong>Powerful Owl</strong></li>\n<li><em>Oxyura australis</em>, <strong>Blue-billed Duck</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pachycephala inornata</em>, <strong>Gilbert's Whistler</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pachycephala olivacea</em>, <strong>Olive Whistler</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pandion cristatus</em>, <strong>Eastern Osprey</strong></li>\n<li><em>Petroica boodang</em>, <strong>Scarlet Robin</strong></li>\n<li><em>Petroica phoenicea</em>, <strong>Flame Robin</strong></li>\n<li><em>Podargus ocellatus</em>, <strong>Marbled Frogmouth</strong></li>\n<li><em>Polytelis swainsonii</em>, <strong>Superb Parrot</strong> (breeding)</li>\n<li><em>Ptilinopus magnificus</em>, <strong>Wompoo Fruit-Dove</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ptilinopus regina</em>, <strong>Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove</strong></li>\n<li><em>Stagonopleura guttata</em>, <strong>Diamond Firetail</strong></li>\n<li><em>Stictonetta naevosa</em>, <strong>Freckled Duck</strong></li>\n<li><em>Tyto tenebricosa</em>, <strong>Sooty Owl</strong></li>\n</ul>",
