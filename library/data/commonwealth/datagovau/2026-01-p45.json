    "description": "Original maps and plans created by real estate firms from 1850s to mid 1900s from State Library of Queensland collection collections. \nThe first version of this dataset includes descriptive information and links for 165 digitised maps. The February 2018 version includes descriptions, geographic coordinates and links for 798 digitised maps. The September 2024 version includes descriptions, geographic coordinates and links for 1259 digitised maps. \nEstate maps can give information about land subdivisions, including how the land was subdivided, when it was first auctioned, who the surveyors were and who sold the land. They are useful for investigating the history of urban land areas. \nThe maps are predominantly from Brisbane but also cover some regional areas of Queensland such as the Gold and Sunshine Coasts. \nAdditional information about this collection is available at: https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blog/real-estate-map-collection-treasure-collection-john-oxley-library \nAlso available in State Library’s library catalogue http://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au \nExplore State Library’s events, programs and services at https://slq.qld.gov.au ",

It shows floor space (in square meters) per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. \n\nThe City of Melbourne creates unique codes to account for floor space allocated to residential space, vacant space, open space and common area. These unique codes are not included within ANZSIC 1 classification and therefore these floor areas are not included in this data set.\n\nThis data set has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The row and column totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.\n\nNon-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement.

We aim to explore the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through the application of the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained across a wide bandwidth spanning 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. Emission heights will be measured using both the delay-radius and geometrical\n  methods to examine their frequency dependence and test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of different profile components will be conducted to constrain pulsar emission properties, while pulse intensity modulations will be analyzed to identify potential phase-lock phenomena. Our study will provide more information on the understanding of the properties of pulsars with IP emissions.",

    "title": "Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 18 September 2015",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThe Gippsland database V2.1 supersedes the previous version (Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 10 September 2015, GUID: 45261e4b-fbd9-4853-bb16-2bf8c47bf018) which was found to contain errors. \n\nThis database (v2.1) should be considered as the update to v1.5 Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 16 June 2015, GUID: 178b98b7-3107-4cbf-b7ea-fc648c6f5870). \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v2.1  of the Asset database (GIP_asset_database_20150918.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (GIP_asset_database_20150918_GISOnly.gdb), an updated Water Dependent Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-GIP-ALL-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150918.xlsx), a data dictionary (GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Gippsland are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Gippsland bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database both M1 and M3 have been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset.The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \" GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc\" located in the zip file.Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted. \n\n\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe Asset List Database was developed to identify water dependent assets located within the Gippsland Basin bioregion.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t9/12/2014\tInitial database.\n\n1.2\t30/01/2015\t\n\nDatabase updated with elements and assets derived from additional source datasets: Economic_SW; VICADV_VulnFauna and Flora; Plantation Forests; Irrigation Districts; Inundation    100 year flood extent; Landscape Priority Areas (West); Farm Dam boundaries.\n\n\n\n1.3\t12/02/2015\tAIDs updated for new assets (existing AID + 20000) to avoid duplication of AIDs used in databases for other subregions.\n\n\n\n1.4\t9/06/2015\t\n\n(1) Previous groundwater, surface water, GMA and WSPA assets (sources: VIC_DEPI_ECON_GW, Vic_Surfacewater Licences Economic Asset Data, ECON_GW_VIC_GMA and ECON_GW_VIC_WSPA respectively) were turned off (i.e. the field of InRegister in table AssetList   has a value No). Theirs AIDs are from 16696 to 16706, 12006 to 12015 and 46598 to 46759.\n\n(2) New groundwater, surface water, GMA and WSPA assets (sources: VIC_DEPI_ECON_GW_May2015, VIC_DEPI_ECON_SW_May2015, VIC_ECON_GW_GMA and VIC_ECON_WSPA) were added in\n\n(3) New surface water polygon SDL data, which was also used to group surface water elements to assets, was added in. The new AIDs for (2) and (3) are from 46894 to 479081 inclusive\n\n(4)One previous asset (AID: 12729) is duplicated to one asset in MBC (AID: 11636) . its AID, Asset Name, Group, SubGroup, Depth, Source, ListDate and Geometry is using values from that MBC asset.\n\n(5) The name of one asset (AID: 15546) was changed because its previous name may be not for publication\n\n(6) The databases, especially spatial   database, were changed such as duplicated attributes fields in spatial data were removed and only ID field is kept.\"\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n(1) Change title to Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 16 June 2015 from subregion to bioregion\n\n(2) Update new AIDs (from 46894 to 47081 inclusive) on09/06/2015 to new AIDs (66894 to 67081inclusive): new \\[AID\\]=Previous \\[AID\\]+20000\"\n\n\n\nv2   10/9/2015   ERRORS IDENTIFIED\n\n(1) The explanations for M2 decisions have been updated based on advice from the project team. Detailed explanations were updated into the DecisionReason field of the AssetDecisions table, and the brief reason into the assetList and assetDecisions tables.\n\n(3) The draft BA-GIP-ALL-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150910.xlsx has been created as an output of this database.\n\n(4) Four standard queries have been included in the database to ensure consistency in obtaining asset and element counts and groupings for reporting. \n\n(5) Areas and lengths updated for assetList and ElementList tables polygons and polylines, where values were found to be null.\n\n\n\nv2.1 18/09/2015: Corrected M2 decisions incorporated into database and water-dependent asset register and asset list, as resupplied 15/9/2015.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 18 September 2015.

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The e-atlas data we have provided is site means… i.e.. the mean of those 25 values. \r\n- LCC - Live coral cover (percent cover), live hard and soft coral pooled.\r\n- LHC - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n- MAC - Macro Algae Cover % (fleshy algas only, does not include turf algae)\r\n- Fish Line_SUM - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. = total number of lines/1500m2.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.\tWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans, R.D., Jones, G.P., Russ, G.R.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with imaging costs, and out-of-pocket cost per diagnostic imaging service attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nDiagnostic imaging services are Medicare-subsidised diagnostic imaging procedures such as x-rays, computerised tomography scans, ultrasound scans, magnetic resonance imaging scans and nuclear medicine scans.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

The data values are representative of a yearly average based on the four years of: 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nTourism Research Australia (TRA) first developed Local Government Area tourism profiles in 2007 to assist industry and Government decision making and to identify and support investment opportunities, particularly in regional Australia.

Data are drawn from TRA's International Visitor Survey (IVS) and National Visitor Survey (NVS), along with demographic and business data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Profiles were only prepared for Local Government Areas with adequate IVS and NVS sample to present robust results. Further, data are averaged over four years, which minimises the impact of variability in estimates from year to year, and provides for more robust volume estimates.\nFor more information please visit TRA.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were, \"np\", not published or \"-\", not available, in the original data, they have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This proposal aims to constrain burst rates and spin down properties of a sample of new Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) discovered with the ASKAP CRAFT Coherent upgrade (CRACO) system. Over the past 12-months of commissioning, CRACO discovered and precisely localised 15 new RRATs, characterised by their sporadic pulses with dispersion measures (DM) consistent with Galactic sources. We request 22.5h of Parkes time split into three 30min observations spanning 6-months for each target. This can help constrain periods and potentially phase-coherent timing solutions given that we already have arcsec-precision interferometric localisations. Our main science goals are: 1) to measure their burst rates, periods, and spin-down properties; 2) to assess their nulling fraction and intermittency; 3) to measure their polarimetric properties and constrain their emission mechanism; 4) to determine if the CRACO RRATs are fundamentally different from the known RRAT population. Some of these goals can be answered even with the detection of a limited number of pulses.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

Trained community volunteers collect quantitative data on the Great Barrier Reef and in the Southeast Queensland coral habitats. Data include substrate percent cover, abundance of key invertebrate species and target fish species. Data on natural and anthropogenic impacts on coral community health are also recorded. The Reef Check method is used which is used in 90 countries world-wide, making these results directly comparable globally.\r\n\r\nData units:\r\nQuantitative, integer, discrete (e.g number of fish, invertebrates etc).\r\nPercentage (e.g. percent coral cover)\r\nCategorical (e.g. siltation level: low, medium, high)",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

There are 76 climate products that describe temperature and rainfall parameters tailored to crop growing requirements as part of the Enterprise Suitability Mapping Program (link: https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/agriculture/investing-in-irrigation/enterprise-suitability-toolkit/enterprise-suitability-maps).\n\nThe products include climate risk indicators such as frost risk, heat risk, and extreme rainfall risk, as well as crop related indices including growing degree days and chill hours. In addition, mean monthly climate surfaces are provided for maximum and minimum air temperature and rainfall.\n\nThese grids represent modelled climate observations for the baseline period 1998-2017 and are designed to complement CMIP6.0 climate projection outputs available through The LIST (link: https://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/app/content/data/geo-meta-data-search?profileType=&amp;groupName=&amp;bboxNorth=&amp;bboxWest=&amp;bboxSouth=&amp;bboxEast=&amp;titleSearch=true&amp;query=digital+climate&amp;_keywordCategory=-1&amp;isTasmania=true&amp;custodian=&amp;sortBy=Title%3AASC&amp;matches=10). A detailed inventory and description of each dataset are provided in the Inventory of Digital Climate Mapping for Tasmania (link: https://nrmdatalibrary.dpipwe.tas.gov.au/FactSheets/WfW/ListMapUserNotes/Inventory_DCM_Tas.pdf).\n\nAll climate products are accessible via the Natural Assets Web Map Service (WMS) at https://spatial.dpipwe.tas.gov.au/naturalassets/Climate/wms.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2006.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Unlike most other countries in the OECD, the social security payment system is funded through government revenue; it is not based on past contributions and is not capped or time limited.  In addition, Australia has Medicare, a publicly funded universal health system, which includes subsidised medication under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  The Government also provides significant investment in education, supporting government and non-government schools, as well as higher education and vocational education and training (Budget 2018-19, Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment). \r\nAnalysis by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW, 2015-16 data) shows expenditure by Australian and state and territory governments on welfare was $157.2 billion, up from $116.8 billion in 2006-07 constant prices.  Overall, for the period from 2006-07 to 2015-16 welfare expenditure grew more quickly than the overall economy over the same period.  This figure includes $105.1 billion) in cash payments for specific populations (not including unemployment benefits), $42.2 billion in welfare services and 9.9 billion in unemployment benefits (AIHW, Australia’s Welfare 2017, p.27).\r\n",

    "description": "The Ombai deepwater mooring was first deployed on 2011-06-19 at (8.53 S, 125.09 E) in the Indonesian Throughflow.\n\nInstrumentation includes 150 kHz and 75kHz ADCPs, Seabird SBE39s, discrete current meters and Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES).\n\nThe mooring provides profile velocity data above 500m and point source velocity between 500m and 1200m (depth of controlling sill). Temperature and salinity data are collected for the entire water column.\n\nThe aim of IMOS Indonsian Throughflow moorings (Indoflow) is to sustainably and directly measure the leakage of Pacific thermocline and intermediate waters from the western equatorial Pacific into the South Indian Ocean. The Indonesian Passages represent an important 'choke point' of the global ocean overturning circulation and the climate system. The interannual to decadal variability of the size and depth distribution of the flow through this choke point remains a troublesome unknown. In particular, changes in this flow will reflect long term changes in the Pacific and Indian Ocean wind fields, particularly any change in the Walker Circulation, as predicted by coupled climate models forced by increasing Greenhouse Gas scenarios. Changes in the associated heat flux are also anticipated at the global oceans warm. The Indoflow array design is based on the more comprehensive INSTANT process study and is deemed the minimal required mooring array to monitor the Indonesian Throughflow. The Ombai Strait and Timor Passage Throughflow components comprise about 11Sv of the 14 Sv total interbasin exchange. The Indoflow array integrates with the AIMS NAOS shelf line, allowing estimates of the interbasin exchange to include the transport of very warm waters across the Australian North West Shelf. All moorings in the Timor Passage are located along a high precision swath line of the TOPEX/Jason satellite altimeter missions. These data will shed light on how best to exploit altimetric data over our shallow northern shelves, especially in data assimilating models.",

    "description": "\nThis point dataset shows the locations of streetlight columns in the Australian Capital Territory. \n\nThese assets are either owned or managed by City Services, Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate (TCCS). Assets managed and / or owned privately, by other ACT Government Directorates or by the Federal Government may not be included.\n\nThe dataset includes streetlight luminaires and/or streetlight columns (as some streetlights are mounted to electricity poles or other structures). Streetlights are external lights that illuminate the road network and/or open spaces at night time. There are a range of different styles, heights, lamp types and brightness of lights depending on the amount of light required. The asset numbers are physically mounted to each streetlight and they are determined by the suburb code and a sequential number. It is common practice for asset numbers to be reused when street lights are removed, replaced or relocated.\n\nAttributes include location description, suburb, ownership, maintained by, asset sub type (Streetlight Column And Luminaire, Streetlight Luminaire Only), column height and material, the number of lamps and outreach arms, luminaires and power type, the associated cable type and conduit, the status of the streetlight, when it was installed and the reference information for the source of the data. \n\nThese assets are captured and maintained in the TCCS asset database through the works as executed (WAE) handover process or field audits. The information available in this dataset may be incomplete and should not be solely relied upon as a search. No warranty is given in relation to the data (including accuracy, reliability, completeness or suitability) and no liability accepted (including without limitation, liability in negligence) for any loss damage or costs (including consequential damage) relating to any use of the data. Minor to substantial delays may occur in updating the source data to reflect as-constructed information. This data is generally used for the Dial Before You Dig (DBYD) service and should be used as a guide only.\n\nFor additional information, please see the relevant municipal infrastructure standard (https://www.cityservices.act.gov.au/plan-and-build/standards-codes-and-guidelines/municipal-infrastructure-design-standards-mis).",

This comparison is in contrast to the previous 5 years, where the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population has consistently had higher notification rates than the Australian-born non-Indigenous population. \r\n\r\n*Trends in HIV notification rates in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population are based on small numbers and may reflect localised occurrences rather than national patterns.",

It has been selected as the basis of the equity loading for socio-economic background in the department’s Resource Allocation Model.\n\n\nIncludes all hospital schools, Stewart House School and Royal Far West School.\n\n\nExcludes Aurora College, Palm Avenue School, NSW School of Languages and all Environmental Education Centres.\n\n\nAs of 2022, Norfolk Island (previously included in North West NSW SA4 Grouping from 2016) is no longer under the jurisdiction of NSW, and therefore not included in the figures.\n\n\nSA4 groupings are a geographical structure based on the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \n\n\nMore information on the FOEI methodology and SA4 groupings is available in the Statistical Bulletin explanatory notes. \n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

The mapping shows areas where a wind erosion hazard might exist if sufficient groundcover is not maintained, which could lead to soil resource degradation through soil, organic matter and nutrient loss after significant wind events.  Assigned classes are; Nil, Low, Moderate and High as classified ratings of a wind erosion index.  The index was generated by combining Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) inputs of the soil properties Coarse Fragments, Sand %, Clay %, Organic Carbon %, Soil Structure, with ratings developed by the DPIPWE Land Degradation and Salinity Risk assessments.

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway.

    "description": "This report details the flood gauging operation undertaken on 30th April, 1988 and\npresents the data collected for the Georges River catchment, Sydney.\n\nThe Georges River catchment area is approximately 960 square kilometres and is\nshown in Figure 1.1. The main arm of the river begins its course near the Cataract\nDam, and exits into Botany Bay. The main channel is joined throughout its course\nby minor streams and creeks. The Woronora River catchment also drains into the\nGeorges River.\n\nThe catchment area comprises a large part of the south western urban area of the\ncity of Sydney, and the floods that have occurred in the catchment have at times\ncaused significant damage to property.\n\nTo rationalise future development of the area in the face of potential flood threats,\nvarious numerical and physical models have been developed by both the University\nof N.S.W. Water Research Laboratory, and the Public Works Department's Manly\nHydraulics Laboratory. The success of the models in predicting the flooding\ncharacteristics of various flood events depend upon collecting specific flood data\nover a series of floods for model calibration and verification. To this end, all known\ninformation regarding previous floods has been documented (Ref. 1 and 4), but\nthere is a need for more comprehensive flood data, especially for major floods.\n\nManly Hydraulics Laboratory (M.H.L.) was requested by the Department's Coast\nand Rivers (C&amp;R) Branch to co-ordinate and undertake flood monitoring at various\nsites over the area which is being modelled. These monitoring sites appear in Figure\n1.2. Previous reports (Ref. 1 and 4) detail the results of gauging of earlier floods\nundertaken in 1978, 1983 and 1986.\n\nFlood gauging on the 30th April, 1988 was carried out by personnel from the\nDepartment's M.H.L. and C&amp;R.\n\nThe general extent of the flooding 12 hours after the peak can be seen in Plates 1 4.\n\nThe current metering lines, flood gauge locations and automatic recorder locations\nfrom which data was collected are as follows:\ni) Current metering/gauge observations at:\n<ol>\n<li>East Hills Footbridge</li>\n<li>Mountbatten Bridge</li>\n<li>Lansdowne Bridge</li>\n</ol>\n\nii) Automatic recorders located at:\n<ol>\n<li>Milperra Bridge</li>\n<li>Cutler Road, Lansvale</li>\n<li>Scrivener Street, Warwick Farm (* This recorder malfunctioned during the flood event.)</li>\n<li>Liverpool Weir</li>\n<li>Prospect Creek, Lansdowne</li>\n</ol>",

    "description": "The Portland Passive Acoustic Observatory consists of two to four moorings fitted with hydrophones set on the seabed at ~170 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of:\n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and\n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian).\n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with GP costs, and out-of-pocket cost per GP attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare-subsidised patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances exclude services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Petrel Sub-basin Marine Survey GA-0335 (SOL5463) was acquired by the RV Solander during May 2012 as part of the Commonwealth Government's National Low Emission Coal Initiative (NLECI). The survey was undertaken as a collaboration between the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and GA. The purpose was to acquire geophysical and biophysical data on shallow (less then 100m water depth) seabed environments within two targeted areas in the Petrel Sub-basin to support investigation for CO2 storage potential in these areas.\n\nThe survey mapped two targeted areas of the Petrel-Sub-basin located within the Ptrl-01 2009 Greenhouse Gas acreage release area (now closed). Data acquired onboard the AIMS research vessel, Solander included multibeam sonar bathymetry (471.2 km2 in Area 1 and 181.1 km2 in Area 2) to enable geomorphic mapping, and multi-channel sub-bottom profiles (558 line-kilometres in Area 1 and 97 line-kilometres in Area 2) to investigate possible fluid pathways in the shallow subsurface geology. Sampling sites covering a range of seabed features were identified from the preliminary analysis of multibeam bathymetry and shallow seismic reflection data. Sampling equipment deployed during the survey included surface sediment grabs, vibrocores, towed underwater video, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profilers and ocean moorings. A total of 14 stations were examined in Area 1 (the priority study area) and one station in Area 2.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the survey activities and preliminary results from survey SOL5463. Detailed analyses and interpretation of the data acquired during the survey will be integrated with new and existing seismic data. This new information will support the regional assessment of CO2 storage prospectivity in the Petrel Sub-basin and contribute to the nation's knowledge of its marine environmental assets.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "title": "WAMSI 2 - Kimberley Node - 1.2.4 - Relative abundance, population genetic structure and acoustic monitoring of Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins in regions within the Kimberley",
    "description": "This WAMSI 2 project complements wider research programs which aim to increase our understanding of the distribution, abundance and population connectivity of Australian snubfin (Orcaella heinsohni) and humpback (Sousa sahulenis) dolphins, including the development of new research and monitoring methods. \nIn this project, we: \n(i) collected genetic samples from snubfin and humpback dolphins at selected locations in the Kimberley and assessed the connectivity between these and previously sampled populations elsewhere in north-western Australian waters; \n(ii) collected boat-based sightings and photo-identification data to assess the relative abundance of snubfin and humpback dolphins at selected locations in the Kimberley region; and, \n(iii) investigated the application of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as an effective technique for monitoring these species, including: characterisation of the underwater soundscape of two Kimberley locations; and, the collection of data on the acoustic repertoire and vocalisation rates of snubfin and humpback dolphins. \nOur results provide managers and policy-makers with valuable data on the relative importance of several sites within the Kimberley region to snubfin and humpback dolphins, along with an improved understanding of the connectivity of populations and the appropriate geographic scales at which to manage them. We have shown that PAM provides a method of effectively detecting snubfin and humpback dolphins in high-use areas, and have increased the information base from which to further develop PAM towards more quantitative and species-specific monitoring of these dolphins.\nOur collaborative approach included training and participation by Yawuru, Bardi-Jawi, Dambimangari and Balanggarra Traditional Owners, and a Marine Park Joint Management team. This has resulted in an improved understanding and capacity of relevant local land and sea managers to collect data on these poorly-understood species within remote areas, and laid the foundation for ongoing research in the Kimberley region.",

    "description": "We propose to carry out the most ambitious and comprehensive all-sky survey for pulsars and transient sources to date. Using the 20cm multibeam and a new digital filterbank array this survey will create a petabyte digital record of the sky that can be data mined in the future and used to search for relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars, RRATs, and extragalactic radio bursts. The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

    "description": "A historic dataset derived from the original Stress Rivers Approach (SRA) developed during the 1990s, prior to the introduction of the Water Management Act 2000. This early method classified rivers according to stress indicators such as water extraction pressure and ecological condition. It represents one of the first systematic attempts to quantify river stress across NSW and serves as an important baseline for later risk assessments. \n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

    "title": "Primary and Secondary Coastal Sediment Compartment Maps",
    "description": "The National Classification of Coastal Sediment Compartments captures information on the spatial extent of all sediment compartments on the Australian coast. The classification implements a conceptual framework that supports regional and site-specific coastal management and can guide the selection of approaches to modelling shoreline response. The classification is based on the sediment systems and the geomorphologic processes that operate therein. This information is fundamental for predicting how the shoreline responds to the processes that act on it, both in the current and future climate. These include changes in waves and currents associated with sea-level rise and the placement of coastal infrastructure, e.g. sea walls and ports.\n\nThe classification is provided as two maps depicting primary and secondary sediment compartments, defined by polygons intersecting the coastline. The classification is hierarchical, such that secondary compartments fall within the extent of the primary compartments. Compartment extents, as identified by a panel of independent coastal science experts, were based on geology, geomorphology, topography and shoreline aspect. Primary compartment borders occur where these features were identified at scales between 1:250 000 and 1:100 000. Secondary compartment borders occur where these features were identified at scales less than 1:100 000\n\nThe seaward and landward boundaries of the compartments were defined by the offshore bathymetric depth and the onshore topographic elevation, respectively as follows:\n\t-130 m and +50 m elevation values for primary compartments, and  \n\t-50 m and +25 m elevation values for secondary compartments.\n\nThis product is the result of a collaboration between Geoscience Australia and the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Climate Change, Technology and Tertiary Education. The spatial data shown in the maps, along with a detailed report and spatial data for the remaining broader scale compartments, will be available via web delivery in late 2013 through the Geoscience Australia website (www.ga.gov.au).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "The Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update 2020 dataset is the national compilation of catchment scale land use data available for Australia (CLUM), as at December 2020. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2018. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. The CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management Classification version 8. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program. Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2008 to 2019) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. Date and scale of mapping are provided in a supporting dataset.\r\n\r\n#What’s new?#\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the December 2018 version: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nThe following areas include some reclassification; the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory, rural residential areas in New South Wales.\t\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. \r\n\r\n#Citation#\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

The regions are based on boundaries set by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Each regional profile presents an overview of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors in the region and the recent financial performance of the broadacre and, where relevant, dairy industries. \r\n\r\n About My Region  consists of the 56 profiles and a web site providing access. The web site contains: • a map allowing users to navigate to an area of interest and select to open the associated regional profile, and \r\n• a list of regions, organised by state that also link to the profiles. \r\n",

NSW Health now reports daily COVID-19 cases as a total of local and overseas cases. With quarantine-free international travel, overseas origin of cases can no longer be determined immediately, but will be included in the COVID-19 weekly surveillance reports. The NSW COVID-19 cases by location dataset will continue to be published.\nThe data is for confirmed COVID-19 cases only based on location of usual residence, not necessarily where the virus was contracted. The case definition of a confirmed case is a person who tests positive to a validated specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test or has the virus identified by electron microscopy or viral culture, at a reference laboratory. Data reported at 8pm daily.\nCase counts reported by NSW Health for a particular notification date may vary over time due to ongoing investigations and the outcome of cases under review thus this dataset and any historical data contained within is subject to change on a daily basis.\nThe underlying dataset was assessed to measure the risk of identifying an individual and the level of sensitivity of the information gained if it was known that an individual was in the dataset. The dataset was then treated to mitigate these risks, including suppressing and aggregating data. ",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The 2021-22 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2021-22 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2021-22 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2021-22 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2021-22 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2020-21\r\n* 2021-22\r\n* 2022-23\r\n* 2023-24\r\n* 2024-25\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture, Water and the Environment\r\n* Attorney-General's\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education, Skills and Employment\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health\r\n* Home Affairs\r\n* Industry, Science, Energy and Resources\r\n* Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook and Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing are included for reference as well.",

    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are reported in this statistical table.\r\n\r\nData are shown for a range of countries and regions. Similar data for a selected group of countries are also available in statistical table B13.1.\r\n\r\nCountry and regional groupings are based on the classification used in the IBS.\r\n\r\nData presented in this statistical table are immediate risk claims (expressed by the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis), which cover exposures on an immediate counterparty location basis. Ultimate risk claims are presented in a complementary statistical table B13.2.1, which cover immediate exposures adjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the location of the ultimate counterparty/risk.\r\n\r\nForeign claims represent international claims plus local currency claims. International claims represent cross-border claims in all currencies and foreign offices’ local claims in non-local currencies (which would include, for example, USD claims on New Zealand residents by the New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian-owned bank). Local currency claims on local residents by the foreign offices of reporting entities (for example, the New Zealand (NZD) claims on New Zealand residents by the New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian-owned bank). \r\n\r\nThis statistical table contains seven data worksheets. Six present data for countries within each specified region, while the 'Summary' worksheet shows total foreign claims of the globally consolidated operations of Australian-owned banks for each region, international organisations and unallocated. In each of these worksheets, the data in the last column measures total foreign claims for the region. Total foreign claims for each country add to total foreign claims for the region. However, in some quarters, this cannot be directly verified because data for individual countries and regions have blank entries in order to avoid disclosing confidential bank exposures.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Summary' worksheet, the positions by region and international organisation, and unallocated are summed to produce a ‘Total’ figure that represents reporting entities’ total international exposures.\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay): \nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Sydney (South) - Haymarket in NSW with SA2 code 117031645, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "The aim of the research is to use microsatellite markers to elucidate the stock structures of Pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) and Baldchin groper (Choerodon rubescens) in Western Australian waters.  \nThe research focused on analysing spatial patterns of genetic variation based on single samples from   locations along the south-western Australian coast.\nThe research was done in order to provide information to managers about the spatial scales that are relevant to the biology of these species and the appropriateness of the spatial units currently used for the management of these species, focussing on the West Coast Bioregion.  \nThis research is part of a PhD study being conducted by Michelle Gardner at Murdoch University.\nThe actual data collected are patterns of variation at 12 microsatellite loci stored as Excel spreadsheets",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 5 top cancer groupings (breast - female only, colorectal, lung, melanoma of the skin and prostate) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA3. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA3 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents the number of households by household types for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for Local Government Areas (LGA) and VIFSAs for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset in the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nsmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them\n\n\nlarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level\n\n\nas far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "description": "Survey FK200308 on the R/V Falkor undertook detailed mapping within two significant and biologically unexplored submarine canyons (Cape Range and Cloates Canyon) in the Gascoyne Marine Park. The Gascoyne Marine Park covers 81, 766 km2 adjacent to the Ningaloo Marine Park. The canyons form part of the habitat protection and multiple use zones of the marine park and are identified as Key Ecological Features. The canyons provide an important connection between the abyssal plain environments and the Commonwealth waters adjacent to Ningaloo Reef on the continental shelf. High productivity aided by upwelling through the canyons has been related to aggregations of whale sharks, manta rays, humpback whales, sea snakes, sharks, large predatory fish and seabirds. In addition, the hard canyon walls provide habitat for a range of sessile invertebrates, while the soft sediments on the canyon floor support a range of mobile invertebrates. The data from this survey will provide a comprehensive taxonomic survey to characterise the marine biodiversity of the canyons or to understand the distribution of canyon habitats in relation to the seabed morphology.\n\nThe SuBastian ROV was used to acquire high-resolution video and collect samples. SuBastian is a custom-built work class ROV that conducts scientific work down to 4500m. It is equipped with a Sulis Subsea Z70 deep sea science camera with 4K UHD 2160p optics and sensors for temperature, depth, conductivity and oxygen. \n\nTwenty ROV dives were completed across 16 stations, and these included 12 quantitative imagery transects within the Cape Range Canyon. No quantitative transects were conducted in the Cloates Canyon. The quantitative transects were run for 500 m upslope, ideally at a speed of 0.3 knots and an altitude of 2 m above the seafloor or rock walls.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2.

    "title": "Helium in the Australian liquefied natural gas economy",
    "description": "Australia is about to become the premier global exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), bringing increased opportunities for helium extraction. Processing of natural gas to LNG necessitates the exclusion and disposal of nonhydrocarbon components, principally carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Minor to trace hydrogen, helium and higher noble gases in the LNG feed-in gas become concentrated with nitrogen in the non-condensable LNG tail gas. Helium is commercially extracted worldwide from this LNG tail gas. Australia has one helium plant in Darwin where gas (containing 0.1% He) from the Bayu-Undan accumulation in the Bonaparte Basin is processed for LNG and the tail gas, enriched in helium (3%), is the feedstock for helium extraction. With current and proposed LNG facilities across Australia, it is timely to determine whether the development of other accumulations offers similar potential. Geoscience Australia has obtained helium contents in ~800 Australian natural gases covering all hydrocarbon-producing sedimentary basins. Additionally, the origin of helium has been investigated using the integration of helium, neon and argon isotopes, as well as the stable carbon 13C/12C) isotopes of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon gases and isotopes (15N/14N) of nitrogen. With no apparent loss of helium and nitrogen throughout the LNG industrial process, together with the estimated remaining resources of gas accumulations, a helium volumetric seriatim results in the Greater Sunrise (Bonaparte Basin) &gt; Ichthys (Browse Basin) &gt; Goodwyn–North Rankin (Northern Carnarvon Basin) accumulations having considerably more untapped economic value in helium extraction than the commercial Bayu-Undan LNG development.\n\nPresented at Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association (APPEA) Exhibition &amp; Conference 2018\n\n<b>Citation:</b>  Boreham CJ, Edwards DS, Poreda RJ, Darrah TH, Zhu R, Grosjean E, Main P, Waltenberg K, Henson PA.

    "description": "The data contained in this dataset is based on the Cause Of Death Unit Record File (CODURF) provided by the Australian Coordinating Registry (ACR), the data has been aggregated based on either a single or grouped ICD-10* classification.\n\nMortality statistics are based on the Cause Of Death Unit Record File (CODURF) provided by the Australian Coordinating Registry (ACR) and are reported by year of occurrence. There can be lags in the registration of deaths with the state or territory registries. Consequently, not all deaths are registered in the year that they occur. In addition, a coroner may investigate a death if the death is unexpected or violent (such as a homicide and suicide), when the identity is unknown, cause of death is not known or if the person is in care or custody. The coronial process can take several years, particularly where an inquest is held, or complex investigations are being undertaken. Therefore, there is a delay in reporting deaths through this process.\n\nDeaths for 2022 and 2023 are preliminary and are subject to change.\n\nThe ACT deaths data is collected and maintained by the ACT registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages (ACT RBDM), which records all medical conditions that directly caused or contributed to the death and were applicable, ie the circumstances surrounding a death (eg. motor vehicle accident).\n\nThe National Coronial Information System (NCIS) records and stores information relating to coroner certified deaths for the purposes of retrieval, analysis, interpretation and dissemination to allow for informed death and injury prevention activities.\n\nThe Australian Coordinating Registry (ACR) is an agency appointed by state and territory RBDMs and coroners to coordinate and manage approval of coded deaths data.\n\n*The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision\n\nThe data is presented by the ACT Government for the purpose of disseminating information for the benefit of the public.

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.
