    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months from May to December for 2001 and includes the total over the months. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data is based on modified 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

    "description": "National Flying-Fox Monitoring Program (NFFMP) camp register.\nThe national flying-fox monitoring program commenced in 2013 and is a collaborative project between the Australian, NSW, Queensland, Victorian, South Australian and ACT Governments and CSIRO Land and Water. It involves quarterly counts at all known daytime roost sites of grey-headed and spectacled flying-foxes across both species' national ranges, and at black and little-red flying-fox camps where those camps occur within the range of the previous two species or outside these ranges, where monitoring is possible. The aim of the program is to establish a reliable benchmark for flying-fox populations in 2013 and monitor trends in abundance and distribution in subsequent years. Counts are carried out using a robust scientific methodology developed by the CSIRO Land and Water (this method is described at http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/391f5fed-e287-4dd3-85ac-640037926ef5/files/310112-monitoring-methodology.pdf,  http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/status-and-trends-australias-epbc-listed-flying-foxes). The first full NFFMP census of grey-headed flying-foxes took place on 14-16 February 2013 and was the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken for this species. \n\nThe NFFMP is coordinated by CSIRO Land and Water and Department of Environment in collaboration with the participating state governments.\n\nThis dataset contains all the flying-fox census data collected under the NFFMP (up to and including survey results reflected in the data revision date).\nRestricted\nThe long term ambition of the NFFMP is to make the data publicly available. However, at present the camps and counts data are not available for public release via direct data download. Aggregated data are displayed by an external facing WebGIS viewer. Data could be released for research purposes under standard licence by negotiation with NFFMP.\nDiscuss any use of the data with NFFMP body",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw three or more health professionals for the same condition in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset contains hourly pedestrian counts since 2009 from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated on a monthly basis and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.\nThe sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-sensor-locations/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations</a> dataset which details the location, status and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting pedestrian counts over time.\nImportants notes about this dataset:• Where no pedestrians have passed underneath a sensor during an hour, a count of zero will be shown for the sensor for that hour.• Directional readings are not included, though we hope to make this available later in the year. Directional readings are provided in the <a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-past-hour-counts-per-minute/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)</a> dataset.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/city-population/Pages/pedestrian-counting-system.aspx\">Pedestrian Counting System</a> helps to understand how people use different city locations at different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future.

    "description": "A 6m steel pole has been installed within Central Bommie within the main lagoon of One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the main lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the main lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity.

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Oriental Fruit Fly",
    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Oriental fruit fly model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "On the Australian margin, submarine canyons have formed along all sides of the continent and are exposed to the potential influence of large-scale ocean currents, including the Leeuwin Current and the East Australian Current. Recognised in marine bioregional plans as potential biodiversity hotspots, many of these canyons sit within the new national network of Commonwealth Marine Reserves. This GIS polygon layer contains 753 submarine canyons along the Australian continental margin and external territories. The locations and extents of these canyons were derived from a range of bathymetry datasets. The layer has attributes describing the canyon's shape, morphometric and geographic characteristics. The definitions are as follows. SHAPE_Leng: Perimeter SHAPE_Area: Planar area centreli_L: Centreline length; total length of canyon/sub-canyons centreline(s) MBG_Width: Minimum bounding rectangle width MBG_Length: Minimum bounding rectangle length MBG_Orient: Minimum bounding rectangle orientation len_wid_ra: Length to width ratio; a measure of elongation; larger the value the more elongate the canyon border_ind: Border index; a measure of geometric complexity; larger he value the more fractal the canyon compactnes: a measure of compactness; larger the value the more compact the canyon (or the smaller its border) no_branch: Number of sub-canyons head_incis: Head incision; incision deph of canyon head head_depth: Head depth; water depth of canyon head foot_depth: Foot depth; water depth of canyon foot depth_rang: Depth range; depth range between canyon head and foot slope_mean: Slope mean; average slope gradients within canyon polygon slope_std: Slope standard deviation; standard deviation of the slope gradients within canyon polygon slope_rang: Slope range; range between maximum and minimum slope gradients within canyon polygon surArea1: Surface area; 3-D surface area of canyon rugosity: Rugosity; roughness of canyon surface volume: Volume; 3-D volume enclosed by the canyon bottom and walls head_x: X coordinate of canyon head; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection head_y: Y coordinate of canyon head; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection foot_x: X coordinate of canyon foot; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection foot_y: Y coordinate of canyon foot; in Asia south Equidistant Conic projection h_f_dist: Head to foot distance; euclidian distance between canyon head and foot h_f_slope: head to foot slope; slope gradient between canyon head and foot dist_shelf: Distance to shelf; euclidian distance of canyon to shelf break; a distance of zero indicates that canyon touchs or intersects the shelf break or within the continental shelf near_canyo: Nearest canyon; euclidian distance to the nearest canyon dist_coast: Distance to coast; euclidian distance of canyon to Australian coast focal_var: Focal variety; number of neighbouring canyons within a nominated proximity inci_depth: Incision depth; averged depth of canyon area that incises into shelf break; slope-confined canyons have values of zero inci_area: Incision area; area of canyon area that incises into shelf break; slope-confined canyons have values of zero slope15: Percentage of slope gradient greater than 15 degree; percentage of canyon area with slope gradients greater than 15 degree sinuosity: a measure of the quality of being sinuous; larger the value the more sinuous the canyon shelf_inci: Shelf incision; shlef-incising canyons have value of 1; slope-confined canyons have value of zero dist_river: Distance to revier; euclidian distance to the mouth of the nearest permanent river uncertain: Uncertainty; mapping uncertainty assigned to canyon; larger the value the more uncertain the mapping is marine_reg: Marine region; the location of the canyon in one of the marine regions canyon_nam: The name of canyon if known map_region: Map region; the location of canyon in one of the map regions Please refer to Marine Geology 357, 362-383 for details of mapping methods.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset contains status, location and directional information for each pedestrian sensor device installed throughout the city.  The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with related datasets. \n\nSince the inauguration of the <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/city-population/Pages/pedestrian-counting-system.aspx\">Pedestrian Counting System</a> in 2009, some sensor devices have been removed or relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works. Others may be inactive due to a temporary issue. This is detailed in the notes column.  Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.\n\nSensors are typically installed under an awning or on a street pole to form a counting zone on the footpath below. They record bi-directional pedestrian movements through the zone, 24 hours, every day. Locations are selected based on three criteria – retail and event activity, regular pedestrian use and the egress and entry flow to these areas. The system records movements, not images, so no individual information is collected.  New sensor devices have been recently installed, with more to come in the near future as part of the city’s commitment to expanding the system. \n\nStatus field:\nThis field indicates if the sensor is expected to be active and is manually maintained as needed. A pedestrian sensor with an active value ('A') may be unavailable in some situations. \n\nA representation of pedestrian volume which compares each location on any given day and time can be found in our <a href=\"http://www.pedestrian.melbourne.vic.gov.au/?_ga=2.44607906.760678413.1541972518-340051665.1506055261\">Online Visualisation</a>.\nRelated datasets: <b><a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-monthly-counts-per-hour/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System – 2009 to Present (counts per hour)</a></b><b><a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/pedestrian-counting-system-past-hour-counts-per-minute/information/\">Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)</a></b>",

    "description": "The Timor North deepwater mooring was first deployed on 2011-06-14 at (8.86 S, 127.20 E) in the Indonesian Throughflow.\n\nInstrumentation includes 150 kHz and 75kHz ADCPs, Seabird SBE39s, discrete current meters and Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES).\n\nThe mooring provides profile velocity data above 500m and point source velocity between 500m and 1200m (depth of controlling sill). Temperature and salinity data are collected for the entire water column.\n\nThe aim of IMOS Indonsian Throughflow moorings (Indoflow) is to sustainably and directly measure the leakage of Pacific thermocline and intermediate waters from the western equatorial Pacific into the South Indian Ocean. The Indonesian Passages represent an important 'choke point' of the global ocean overturning circulation and the climate system. The interannual to decadal variability of the size and depth distribution of the flow through this choke point remains a troublesome unknown. In particular, changes in this flow will reflect long term changes in the Pacific and Indian Ocean wind fields, particularly any change in the Walker Circulation, as predicted by coupled climate models forced by increasing Greenhouse Gas scenarios. Changes in the associated heat flux are also anticipated at the global oceans warm. The Indoflow array design is based on the more comprehensive INSTANT process study and is deemed the minimal required mooring array to monitor the Indonesian Throughflow. The Ombai Strait and Timor Passage Throughflow components comprise about 11Sv of the 14 Sv total interbasin exchange. The Indoflow array integrates with the AIMS NAOS shelf line, allowing estimates of the interbasin exchange to include the transport of very warm waters across the Australian North West Shelf. All moorings in the Timor Passage are located along a high precision swath line of the TOPEX/Jason satellite altimeter missions. These data will shed light on how best to exploit altimetric data over our shallow northern shelves, especially in data assimilating models.",

    "description": "The Vegetation Trend product is a multiband image file that contains summaries of change in reflectance of vegetation over time using the Land Monitor Landsat based vegetation index related to vegetation density (red band + short wave infrared band 1) calculated for each annual date of imagery. Two time periods are provided in the south west agricultural zone only where the Land Monitor index can be more confidently applied, these time periods are 1990-current year and the last 10 years. The summaries are statistical measures of mean, linear trend over time, quadratic trend over time, standard deviation about mean, residual standard deviation after fitting linear trend and residual standard deviation after fitting linear and quadratic trends. The statistical summaries can be displayed separately or together to summarise trends and stability of vegetation over time as measured by the Land Monitor vegetation index, and in particular to highlight areas with different patterns of change.\n\nClick <a href=\"https://data.wa.gov.au/land-monitor\">here</a> for more information.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The commissioning of new dedicated FRB detection systems has led to an exponential increase in the detected FRBs over the last decade. Despite &gt;700 FRBs published to date, there is still a lack of understanding about the physical mechanisms through which FRB emission is produced. Due to the possibility of detecting multiple bursts from the same source in a repeating FRB, it forms an ideal sample set to uncover the physics of the source (e.g., emission mechanism, progenitor surrounding media), and test possible progenitor models. The coherent upgrade to the FRB detection system to ASKAP is expected to detect ~1-2 FRB/week. However, due to the limited fractional bandwidth available with ASKAP and survey nature of the telescope, probing the spectro-polarimetric characteristics of repeating sources is non-optimal. Hence, the large bandwidth offered by the ultra wideband-low (UWL) on Parkes/Murriyang is an ideal instrument to follow-up repeating FRB sources discovered through CRACO. Over the next ~6 months, we expect to double the number of repeaters that have been studied through the UWL. This will provide unprecedented insight into the progenitor environment and the surrounding media of repeating FRBs. We propose using the UWL to follow up repeater-like sources to study their wideband spectro-polarimetric characteristics.",

    "description": "This Bio Acoustic data was collected in May 2012 under the IMOS Ship of Opportunity (SOOP) Bio Acoustic (BA) program on Australian Wild Tuna's Santo Rocca (IMOS platform code: LFB13191P).\n\nDeparted:  Australia, May 16, 2012\nArrived:  \t Australia, May 19, 2012\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

These moorings comprise the Indonesian Throughflow array, which was deployed in June 2011. This is an important first step in the enhanced monitoring of northern Australian waters.  These shelf moorings complement the three deep-water moorings deployed in the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait to monitor inter-basin Indian-Pacific Ocean exchange.\n\nProcessed data from the first two deployments (Jun 2010 and Jan 2011) are now available.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "The compilation of Australia’s emissions data — called the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory — is undertaken centrally by the Department of the Environment.  Although not legislatively required to report on our emissions, ACC have generated a GHG Inventory report on it's energy usage on a yearly basis since 2010.  \nAustralia’s National Greenhouse Accounts conform to the international guidelines adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The National Greenhouse Gas Inventory is reviewed annually by a team of international experts.\nAustralia’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory is supported by a set of institutional arrangements which is designed to facilitate close coordination of the compilation of the inventory, efficient emissions data management, broadly based quality assurance processes and secure and reliable data collections.\nMore information including metadata can be found at:  http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/national-greenhouse-accounts-factors-dec-2014 ",

This vessel circumnavigated Australia every 28 days with an additional stop in the Port of Singapore. Underway T, S and F were measured continuously throughout the period of the project. At times an observer was on board and collected samples from the outflow of the underway system for the determination of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, the absorption co-efficient for the dissolved component (aCDOM) of the water and salinity. In all 277 samples were collected during the 10 month period of the project. Retrieved chlorophyll a estimates from the SeaWifs ocean colour sensor were also collected and compared with the in situ data.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2012 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 1,139,275 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/vbe9-m4tk.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.51GB, 52.5 million rows)",

    "description": "This dataset captures the diversity of students with a language background other than English (LBOTE) who are enrolled in NSW government schools. \nData Notes:\n\n\nLBOTE students are those in whose home a language other than English is spoken by the student, parents, or other primary caregivers.\n\n\nLBOTE and total (headcount) enrolment figures are collected in March of each year. Most other collections use enrolment data that are collected as part of the Mid Year Census in August. \n\n\nThe table is ordered by the largest language groups for language groups with 1000 or more students in the most recent year presented. Language groups with fewer than 1000 students are included in 'other language groups'.\n\n\nIndian and Chinese Languages are included as a combined total, and also as separate distinct languages. Therefore Indian and Chinese data appears twice in the table. \n\n\nDue to rounding issues, the total percentage for Indian and Chinese Language groups may be slightly different to the sum of the distinct languages.\n\n\nThere can be minor changes in the categorization of less common languages and dialects over time. For example, these definitional variations account for the difference in the 2018 total as reported in the ‘Enrolments of LBOTE government school students by largest language groups’ table in the 2018 and 2019 LBOTE bulletins. \n\n\nData Source:\n\nCentre for Education Statistics and Evaluation, NSW Department of Education.\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "This layer describes the stormwater priority areas for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Stormwater priority areas were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates. The stormwater priority area polygons were created by merging sub-catchments from University of Melbourne’s subc layer, i.e. the network of sub-catchments used for assessing attenuated imperviousness and for habitat suitability modelling. Primary purpose for this data is identifying stormwater priority areas of Melbourne Water's Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This dataset covers the Greater Melbourne region with the stormwater priority areas presented in this dataset aligning with the priorities of the Melbourne Water Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. However, it is important to note that stormwater management activities require additional judgement to consider whether areas beyond (e.g. upstream) of the priority areas identified will also require treatment to achieve the desired waterway health outcomes.The harvesting and infiltration targets presented in this dataset provide an estimate of what is required to achieve stormwater disconnection and recreation of the natural hydrology. However, is should be noted that these values are approximate only and do not replace site-specific investigations. The values have been calculated in reference to Walsh et al. 2012 , who presented target ranges for infiltration and harvesting required to achieve urban stormwater disconnection (i.e. re-creation of forested/vegetated hydrology). The values presented are the average of the ranges estimated by Walsh et al. 2012. These values do not replace a detailed site investigation. Site-specific factors (soil type, topography, geology and other hydrological features of the catchment) will influence the appropriate targets for a site.For further reading on the prioritisation process see:Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice PartnershipMelbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document. Each priority area contains targets for harvesting and infiltration. Achievement of these targets is required to achieve stormwater disconnection. These targets are presented in two ways: per impervious hectare, and total volume to full urban development (i.e. complete urban development to the urban growth boundary). It should be noted that these targets are approximate values only and do not replace site-specific studies. See notes above about how target values were selected.For further reading, see: Walsh, C.

    "title": "Outer Darwin Harbour Marine Survey 2015: Total sediment metabolism, mineral specific surface area, carbonate and element concentrations and C and N isotopes  in seabed sediments.",
    "description": "This resource contains surface sediment data for Outer Darwin Harbour collected by Geoscience Australia during the period from 28 May and 23 June 2015 on the RV Solander (survey SOL6187/GA0351). Partners involved in the survey included the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Department of Land Resource Management (Northern Territory Government). The survey was funded through the INPEX Offset Habitat Mapping Program for the Darwin Harbour region. The intent of this four year (2014-2018) program is to improve knowledge of the marine environments in the Darwin and Bynoe Harbour regions by collating and collecting baseline data that enable the creation of thematic habitat maps that underpin marine resource management decisions. The specific objectives of the survey were to:\n \n1.\tObtain high resolution geophysical (bathymetry) data for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay;\n2.\tCharacterise substrates (acoustic backscatter properties, grainsize, sediment chemistry) for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay; and \n3.\tCollect tidal data for the survey area.\n\nData acquired during the survey included: multibeam sonar bathymetry and acoustic backscatter; physical samples of seabed sediments, underwater photography and video of grab sample locations and oceanographic information including tidal data and sound velocity profiles. These datasets comprise total sediment metabolism, mineral specific surface area and carbonate and element concetrations, and C and N isotopes of seabed sediments.\n\nA detailed account of the survey is provided in: Siwabessy, P.J.W., Smit, N., Atkinson, I., Dando, N., Harries, S., Howard, F.J.F., Li, J., Nicholas, W.A., Potter, A., Radke, L.C., Tran, M., Williams, D. and Whiteway, T., 2015.

    "description": "Fire severity is a metric of the loss of biomass caused by fire. In collaboration with the NSW Rural Fire Service, DCCEEW Remote Sensing &amp; Regulatory Mapping team has developed a semi-automated approach to mapping fire extent and severity through a machine learning framework based on sentinel 2 satellite imagery. The statewide severity map has standardised classes to allow comparison of different fires across the landscape. The FESM severity classes include: unburnt, extent only (grass fires), low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy), moderate severity (partial canopy scorch), high severity (complete canopy scorch, partial canopy consumption), extreme (full canopy consumption).\n\nThis dataset represents the 2024/25 fire year including all wildfires and hazard reductions &gt;10ha with a fire start date between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.",

Data are stored in .ENV and .DAT data files at CSIRO. There are 24 files totalling 154 MB of raw data in this dataset. A wharf tie was undertaken at Hobart location on 2025/3/7 (prior to IN2025_V01) using a Scintrex Autograv CG-5. Wharf tie data can be found in GravityTie_in2025v01_Hobart_250307.TXT, which is stored with the IN2025_V01 raw data.\nDuring this voyage, calibration lines were run for the Air-Sea II to re-establish calibration values after the system was repaired and reinstalled on the vessel (re-installed 30 Sep 2024). Data from the calibration lines were sent to Micro-G Lacoste for processing. New calibration values were applied within the ASII_HW.ini at the end of the voyage on 1st March 2025. \nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

    "title": "Assessment of River-Flat Eucalypt forest on Coastal floodplains TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate",
    "description": "The operational map for River-flat Eucalypt Forest (RFEF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast. \nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for RFEF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that RFEF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of RFEF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas.\nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess the floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover found on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain RFEF.  We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of eucalypt, casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of RFEF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the RFEF determination.\nFollowing this, we developed a predictive statistical model of the probability of occurrence of RFEF using plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables. For the north coast, we used a Random Forest model, while for the south coast we used a Boosted Regression Tree model.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to RFEF if appropriate based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and modelled probabilities underlying each API polygon. \nWe mapped 3819 hectares of RFEF on the south coast and 198 hectares of RFEF on the north coast.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the _Public Sector Management Act 1994_, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sector reports is the employee perception survey (EPS).\r\n\r\nThe EPS captures employee views about factors affecting their workplace, such as leadership, communication, work/life balance and performance development. This information helps to understand organisational culture across the public sector and is essential in identifying areas for further consideration and acknowledging good practice.\r\n\r\nThe EPS is typically conducted in each public sector body with more than 70 employees once every five years. To improve the representativeness of the sample, entities are selected across a range of sizes and portfolios. However, some care should be taken in interpreting the EPS results because the sample may not be entirely representative of the broader public sector.\r\n\r\nIn May and June of 2016, all employees in 11 public sector entities were asked to complete the survey. The average response rate to the survey was 53%, with 3883 valid responses received.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2016.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant employees to access online\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2016 data.xls – individual responses to the EPS, with a question key and response key. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents.\r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2016 data.sav – individual responses to the EPS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the EPS sample and summary results for 2016 are available in the State of the sectors statistical bulletin 2016.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a09.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>dryland maize</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "The scientific objectives for the survey were split across two voyages (SS07/2005 for leg 1 and SS10/2005 for leg 2). The first leg was to map and visually survey (video) the upper continental slope (and at selected sites transects from the outer shelf to the mid-slope) at regular intervals of 1deg latitude; the second leg was to targeted sample the surveyed locations to document the benthic biodiversity. Epibenthic megafauna was sampled in 123 stations using the epibenthic sled Sherman and a beamtrawl at roughly 1 degree intervals from Bald Island in southern WA to Barrow Island (northern WA), at 100 and 400m depth; additional depths (200m, 700m 1000m) were sampled at targeted 'transect sites'. Invertebrate specimens were photographed and lodged with Australian Museums for identification, focused on sponges, corals, echinoderms, crustaceans, molluscs and ascidians. To date (Sept. 2014) we are aware of 27 taxonomic revisions or descriptions have been published from this collection. Fishes were only collected by chance, they are lodged with the CSIRO Fish Collection. The data of the biological samples is described here.",

Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\nNote: On 1 October 2020, PSMA Australia Limited began trading as Geoscape Australia. \r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

    "description": "The 2013 land use captures how the landscape in NSW is being used for food production, forestry, nature conservation, infrastructure and urban development. It can also be used to monitor changes in the landscape and identify resulting impacts on biodiversity values and individual ecosystems.\n\nThe state wide land use data is a compilation of the best available land use information for NSW that was available in August 2017.  \n\nLand use and tenure datasets from a variety of projects have been compiled, these include;\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nLanduse mapping 2017 – 1:10,000 scale mapping using 2013 SPOT 5 satellite imagery and ADS digital aerial imagery. Covering rural zoned, agricultural areas. These areas are applicable to Local Land Services Act 2016.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nNSW Horticulture mapping project – Fine scale mapping (1:5,000) mapping of horticulture production to the commodity level (where applicable), on the mid-north and north coast of NSW. This was in response to the outbreak of Panama disease, Tropical Race 4, found in a banana plantation in Northern Queensland. It is part of a collaborative mapping project to improve Biosecurity information between state jurisdictions and the commonwealth. It also covers plantation forestry for the project area.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHunter 2013 mapping – 1:10,000 scale mapping covering most of the Hunter catchment based on 2013 SPOT5 imagery. It was part of a pilot land use update trial for intended use in Department of Planning Regional Growth Plans. This is an update of the 2005 Land use Hunter catchment and 2008 Upper Hunter catchment land use mapping projects, also available on SDE and P drive.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nNational Parks and State Forest Tenure mapping 2017\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSydney Map sheet 2012 – Detailed urban mapping (1:10,000 scale) trial using high resolution Digital aerial imagery\n</li>\n<li>\n\nExisting Land use information (circa 2003) has been used for non-rural zoned areas and not covered by the other projects mentioned above. This component of the 2013 land use has a reliability scale of 1:25,000. The areas where the circa 2003 land use product used include; urban, industrial, commercial and environmental local government LEP (Local Environment Planning) zones. It also includes areas of metropolitan Sydney that are excluded from the LLS Act 2016.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nLand use information has been captured in accordance with standards set by the Australian Collaborative Land Use Mapping Program (ACLUMP) and using the Australian Land Use and Management ALUM Classification. The ALUM classification is based upon the modified Baxter &amp; Russell classification and presented according to the specifications contained in http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification.\n\nThe 2013 land use, that was mapped for the purposes of the Local Land Services Act, was commenced in July 2016 and completed by August 2017. It covers all rural zoned (agricultural) areas, and was based on most appropriate SPOT5 imagery to represent land use at June 2013. It includes values in the attribute fields of source, source date, source scale, reliability and land use mapping (currency) date.\n\nThe reliability scale of areas mapped form 2012 onward is 1:10,000. For areas where circa 2003 land use information has been used the reliability scale is 1:25,000. This is identified in the source scale attribute for each feature in the dataset.\n\nThe date of the data set is set as the land use occurring at the time the imagery (satellite or aerial) was acquired, which can range from 2003 to 2013. This dataset was updated in August 2017 to include values in the attribute fields of Source, Source Date, Source Scale, Reliability and LU Mapping (Currency) Date.\n\nA national catchment scale land use product is also available as a 50m raster - Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/data-download.",

    "title": "AIHW - Patients Spending on Medicare - Total Out-of-pocket Cost per Patient for Non-hospital Medicare Services (SA3) 2016-2017",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with costs, the total out-of-pocket cost per patient at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile and various statistics for all patients. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nNon-hospital Medicare services are Medicare-subsidised medical services that were provided to patients who were not admitted into a hospital at the time of receiving the service. These include GP and practice nurse attendances, specialist attendances, obstetric attendances, pathology tests and collection items, diagnostic imaging, operations, assistance at operations, optometry, allied health attendances, radiotherapy and therapeutic nuclear medicine that were provided to patients not admitted into a hospital. This includes eligible telehealth services.\n\n\nTotal out-of-pocket cost per patient is the net cost to the patient for all non-hospital Medicare-subsidised health services they claim in a year, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nCosts associated with bulk-billing incentives or other top-up items are included in the analysis.\n\n\nTotal out-of-pocket cost per patient is for patients with out-of-pocket costs greater than zero.\n\n\nAll patients include all patients with out-of-pocket costs equal to, or greater than, zero.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "NSW Tenancy laws say how residential tenancy agreements can be ended. Tenancies are usually terminated by the tenant, landlord, the landlord's agent, or by a Tribunal order. Fair Trading conducted an end-of tenancy survey to collect data about how and why tenancies end. This survey was designed to help Fair Trading to better understand the renting experience to help inform future tenancy reforms.\nThe survey process:  Every principal tenant and landlord or nominated agent is asked to complete a survey when a bond claim is finalised through an online bonds system.  Survey invitations are sent by email and participation is voluntary. Individual responses are kept anonymous.\nFair Trading conducted a pilot end of tenancy survey which ran from 2 December 2019 to 30 March 2020 and from 27 April to 11 May 2020. \nTo mitigate re-identification risks, postcode information has been removed and response dates grouped into months.\nIt should be noted that the representativeness of the survey data is limited, including because:\n•   participation is voluntary\n•   the survey only includes respondents who used Rental Bonds Online to lodge and claim their rental bond, so the sample does not extend to all terminated tenancies\n•   no demographic information is collected\n•   some tenancies had duplicate responses\n•   domestic violence victims may also self-select out of completing such a survey, given their vulnerability and the difficult circumstances they may experience after ending a tenancy.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>chickpea</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "title": "Bushfire Operational Plans Access Management",
    "description": "Land and emergency management agencies in Australia and overseas recognise the importance of an access network to support bushfire management activities. Ground and aerial access provides a platform for fire reduction and readiness activities and provides opportunities to contain fires before they escalate into major fires that could otherwise incur significant costs and potentially significant losses to community, cultural and environmental values.\n\nFire access within the ACT consists of a network of roads, tracks and trails that support fire prevention, readiness and response activities. The identification and maintenance of fire access is an integral element of fire management across the ACT.\n\nAccess management is divided into four areas:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nmaintenance\n</li>\n<li>\n\nupgrade\n</li>\n<li>\n\nconstruction\n</li>\n<li>\n\nvegetation removal.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nACT PCS Fire Management Unit currently manage and maintain approximately 3,218 kilometres of roads and fire trails within the ACT. The classification of fire roads, tracks and trails is performance based to provide clear guidance to response agencies during incidents.\n\nGround access is defined in four classes:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nFloat road – an access road or trail accessible to a low loader float carrying a large bulldozer or other heavy equipment.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nTanker road – a fire trail of strategic importance accessible to a heavy tanker and a tipper carrying a small bulldozer.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLight unit trail – a fire trail accessible at minimum standard for a light unit.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDormant fire trail – a trail that has been deliberately closed or not maintained and can be quickly re-opened with minimal works.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe objective of ground access works are to upgrade and maintain road pavements within the parks and reserves of the ACT to the above four classes standard under the current Bushfire Operational Plan.  Many areas require ongoing general maintenance or upgrading to an appropriate standard. This is done principally to provide reliable access for operational requirements and for fire suppression activities in the event of a wildfire that may threaten the ACT.\n\nVegetation removal work is conducted by mechanical mulchers that reduce vegetation on roads and trails that impede access for operational and fire suppression requirements identified under the current Bushfire Operational Plan. The Parks and Conservation Service Fire Management Unit also commit a number of other contracted resources (graders, trucks, rollers, excavators and backhoes etc) to conduct daily scheduled maintenance as well as upgrade and construction services on a yearly basis within the ACT.\n\nThe Bushfire Operational Plans map shows the Territory and Municipal Services Directorate (TAMS) Bushfire Operations Plan (BOP) for the current financial year.\n\nThe TAMS BOP is derived from the 5 year Regional Fire Management Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The TAMS BOP details the specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and infrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current financial; year, in accordance with Version 3 of the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan (SBMP).\n\nCreative Commons License Creative Common By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory),\nPlease read Data Terms and Conditions statement before use of the data.",

    "description": "This dataset presents locations of regional surface hydrological features in Australia as points at a higher resolution than that of the national dataset. \nThe following features are included in this dataset:\n\n\nBore - A small diameter hole in the ground for the purpose of obtaining subterranean water by natural flow or mechanical pumping.\n\n\nDam - An open body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier consisting of earth, rock, concrete and/or masonry. Generally designed to capture run-off from the surrounding landscape or rainfall. The storage of water may occur on or below ground level.\n\n\nLock - An enclosure in a water body with gates at both ends to raise or lower the water level to enable vessels to pass from one level to another.\n\n\nGnamma Hole - Small holes of varying shape, diameter and depth, found in hard granite outcrops and in the decomposed granite of a breakaway, which can and usually does hold water.\n\n\nNative Well - An isolated natural depression which holds water, not within Watercourses. The natural phenomena is sometimes improved by indigenous persons for their own water collection purposes.\n\n\nPool - A small body of still or standing water, permanent or temporary in an isolated natural depression, not within Watercourses.\n\n\nRockhole - A hole excavated in solid rock by water action. \n\n\nSoak - A depression holding moisture after rain, especially the damp or swamp spots around the base of granite rocks.\n\n\nSpring - A place where water issues from the ground naturally.\n\n\nWaterfall Point - A sudden descent of water over a step or ledge in the bed of a watercourse.\n\n\nWaterhole - A natural depression which holds perennial water, within a non-perennial watercourse or a non-perennial lake.\n\n\nWater Tank - Water Tanks are storage containers for water, usually used for human consumption and other purposes such as irrigation, agriculture, fire suppression, agricultural farming and livestock, chemical manufacturing and food preparation. Water Tanks are constructed of various materials including plastic (polyethylene or polypropylene), fiberglass, reinforced concrete, steel (welded or bolted, carbon or stainless). Those used for human consumption are generally fully enclosed.\n\n\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-03-12\n",

    "description": "Taxation revenue is revenue received from the State’s taxpayers and includes payroll tax, land tax, duties levied principally on conveyances and land transfers, gambling taxes, insurance duty, fire services property levy, motor vehicle taxes and other taxes including congestion levy, metropolitan improvement levy and so on.\nThe State’s taxation revenue is forecast by a process that involves application of DTF’s economic forecasts, where there is a relationship between taxation revenue and economic variables; and use of forward indicators, unpublished revenue data and qualitative information from liaison with relevant stakeholders.\nThis enables an assessment of economic and other factors influencing the tax bases from which taxes are sourced e.g. for payroll tax, an assessment of the outlook for employment.\nWhere necessary, adjustment factors are used to account for other trends or events not captured by the model, such as impact of economic shocks or policy stimulus.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure (measured high blood pressure) is defined as including any of the following; measured systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more, or; diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more, and; irrespective of the use of blood pressure medication. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "The \"Clearing Control Catchments - CAWSA\" dataset relates to Country Areas Water Supply Act 1947 (CAWSA) Part IIA Control of Catchment Areas legislation for controlling the clearing of native vegetation to prevent salinisation of water resources in some existing or potential water source catchments. The dataset is used by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation in administering clearing licence applications, policy decision making and for providing advice.\n\nThe catchments depicted were proclaimed 1976-1978 and became subject to clearing\ncontrols where land owners and occupiers could not clear native vegetation on their property unless authorised under a CAWSA Licence to Clear. The \"Clearing Control Catchments - CAWSA\" dataset also shows Zones of salinity risk in the controlled catchments where Zone A is the highest salinity risk and Zone D the lowest. These zones were used to determine where, in the administration of clearing controls, some limited clearing may be granted in areas of lower salinity risk.\n\nSince the advent of Environmental Protection Act 1986 (EP Act) clearing regulations in 2004, native vegetation clearing proponents state-wide must obtain an EP Act Permit before undertaking any clearing. Landowners and occupiers of CAWSA compensated land and those exempt from the need for an EP Act clearing Permit are however still required to obtain a CAWSA Licence to Clear.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as CAWSA Part 2A Clearing Control Catchments (DOW-028)",

    "description": "Despite the important role Symbiodinium might play we currently have limited knowledge of the distribution ranges of Symbiodinium on the Great Barrier Reef. In order to increase our knowledge a database of Symbiodinium diversity on the GBR compiled from published papers (see database references) was established as part of a large research program 1.1 entitled ¿Risk, Resilience and Response Atlas for the Great Barrier Reef: Vulnerability to Coral Bleaching Project Objective.¿ The goal of project 1.1 is to define the vulnerability of GBR corals to climate change and extend this knowledge along the geographical extent of the GBR. The database presents an overview of the Symbiodinium types that have thus far been found across the GBR and can be accessed through the e-Atlas.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Symbiodinium diversity and the geographical and environmental ranges of the different host/symbiont combinations will help us provide a better estimate of how vulnerable corals on the GBR are to bleaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Units:\r\n\r\nClade: a group of biological taxa or species that share features inherited from a common ancestor. In this case the genus Symbiodinium is divided in 9 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.\r\n\r\nSubclade: a term that is used in genetics to describe a subgroup. Often the different types or strain within a subclade differ only by 1 or 2 nucleotides. The clades (A, B, C, D or G) are accompanied by a number (for example C1) or a number and a letter (for example D1a) to distinguish between the different Symbiodinium types or strains within a subclade.\r\n\r\nDNA region: the DNA regions analyzed in order to differentiate betweenSymbiodinium clades and subclades differ in their resolution or in other words their ability to distinguish between different Symbiodinium types.\r\n- ITS1 = Internal Transcribed Spacer 1\r\n- ITS2 = Internal Transcribed Spacer 2\r\n- 18S rRNA = 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA\r\n\r\n\r\nData was extracted from the following papers:\r\n\r\nLoh et al., 2001; Van Oppen et al., 2001; LaJeunesse et al., 2003; Rodriguez-Lanetty et al., 2003; Ulstrup & Van Oppen, 2003; LaJeunesse et al., 2004a; Fabricius et al., 2004; Van Oppen et al., 2004, 2005a, 2005b; Ulstrup et al., 2006; Sampayo et al., 2007, 2008; Stat et al., 2008; Goulet et al., 2008a, 2008b; Jones et al., 2008; Ulstrup et al., 2008\r\n\r\n\r\nData Location:\r\n\r\nThis dataset is filed in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\custodian\\funding\\MTSRF\\GBR_MTSRF-2-5i-2_UQ_Symbiodinium-clade_1998-2006",

    "description": "A data set of land use between June 2000 and June 2007 for New South Wales.  Land use is classified to three separate classification schemes.  These classification schemes are:3\n<ul>\n<li>NSW Land Use Mapping Program (LUMAP).</li>\n<li>NSW SCALD  (Standard Classification for Attributes of Land) Classification</li>\n<li>ALUM (Australian Land Use and Management) Classification.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe LUMAP Classification is DECC's most recent classification for mapping of land use classes for NSW.  It is a simple numeric classification, open-ended to enable additional classes to be added.\n\nPrior to LUMAP, the SCALD classification was the standard for mapping of land use in NSW.  It is a combined alpha-numeric classification system.\n\nThe ALUM classification is based upon the modified Baxter &amp; Russell classification and presented according to the specifications contained in http://adl.brs.gov.au/mapserv/landuse/index.cfm?fa=app.ALUMClassification.\n\nVersion 6 of the classification describes the land use classes.  Earlier copies of the data set may have used Versions 4 or 5.\n\nThe mapping was commenced in April 2001 and completed by June 2007.  The date of the data set is set as the land use occurring at the time the satellite imagery was acquired, which can range from 1999 to 2006. This dataset was updated in May 2011 to include values in the vacant attribute fields of Source, Source Date, Source Scale, Reliability and LU Mapping Date.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Leadbeater's possum  Gymnobelideus leadbeateri  is a listed threatened species found mainly in montane ash and snowgum forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, with a small occurrence in swamp forests in Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Threats to the species include wildfire, loss of hollow-bearing trees, and the harvesting of native forests. As a consequence, the species is a focus of sustainable forest management. \r\n\r\n The species was nominated for re-listing as Critically Endangered under the  Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  (EPBC Act) in 2013, from its previous category of endangered, with comments on the nomination requested by January 2014. Its listing category was raised from Endangered to Critically Endangered in May 2015, based on the recommendation of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. An updated Draft Recovery Plan for the species was then prepared with input from stakeholders. \r\n\r\n Over the period from 2013 to 2017, ABARES prepared briefing notes regarding the listing, conservation, recovery and management of Leadbeater's possum and the related issue of fire and forest harvesting. This publication brings together a series of these briefing notes. \r\n\r\n The briefing notes are presented as written at the dates indicated, except that occasional minor or typographical errors have been corrected, URLs updated, intra- and inter-departmental references removed, and footnotes now include clarifying amendments. The briefing notes are individually paginated. ",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "The Integrated Forestry Operations Approvals (IFOA) dataset contains the boundaries of the 7 IFOA regions which apply across NSW. The regions include the Upper North East, Lower North East, Southern, Eden, Brigalow – Nandewar, South Western Cypress and Riverina Red Gum. \nIFOAs integrate the regulatory regimes for environmental planning and assessment, protection of the environment and threatened species conservation. IFOAs incorporate licence conditions that protect soil, water and threatened species and their habitats. They also play a key role in the day-to-day planning and activities of the Forestry Corporation of NSW (FCNSW). \nThe terms and conditions under which all forestry operations (including logging) may occur in each region are set out in IFOAs and apply to anyone carrying out forestry operations on state forest and other Crown-timber land.\nThe Environment Protection Authority regulates FCNSW compliance with the non-licence terms, the environment protection licence and the threatened species licence components of the IFOAs, and the Department of Primary Industries – Fisheries regulates FCNSW compliance with the fisheries licence. Further information on IFOAs is available on the EPA website at \nhttp://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/forestagreements/IFOAs.htm",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016</b> \n(Overlay Dataset 3 of 4, needs to be used in conjunction with points, lines and North Lakes Locality datasets). \nThe Infrastructure Buffers Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

The zones extend 20 kilometres either side of the state border and extend from the southern coastline up to the River Murray. This layer contains only the South Australian zones. This layer will mainly be used for administration purposes for water licensing. While this dataset was created in June 1998, the age of the zones is unknown and probably date back to early period of development of the South Australian/Victorian border agreement on groundwater.",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2026 projection, relative to a 2011 baseline, based on a scenario of buildings being retrofitted. It does not include the industrial sector.",

The data is based on 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp. Other Territories (LGA code 99399) were split across two records in the original data, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

Identify and map the principal foraging locations for shearwaters and boobies breeding at the most important colonies of the GBR, both within and between breeding seasons, using a combination of different Geolocation, GPS and Satellite PTT data loggers; \n2. Obtain detailed information on the biophysical oceanographic characteristics of these foraging habitats in both the GBR and Coral Sea regions using a range of biophysical parameters derived from satellite and in situ data; \n3. Quantify how prey availability at these sites varies with climate driven changes in biophysical oceanography; \n4. quantifying the level of prey availability and associated oceanographic conditions required to maintain viable reproduction at significant breeding colonies and 5) establish potential linkages and interactions between these areas/processes and other anthropogenic activities.",

Studies began in 1995 (Y95 cohort), 1998 (Y98 cohort), 2003 (Y03 cohort), 2006 (Y06 cohort) and more recently in 2009 (Y09 cohort). Plans are underway to develop a 2016 cohort.\r\n\r\nCohorts are interviewed annually, however reports and publications based upon the data are released regularly on the website.",

    "description": "This dataset describes habitat suitability for feral pig breeding and persistence in northern Australia during the wet season. It is the result of a spatially-explicit, resource-based and regional-scale habitat model that integrated expert knowledge on feral pig breeding requirements and home range movements as well as seasonal variability in environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe modelled habitat suitability index (HSI) can theoretically range between 0 and 100, with higher values indicating better habitat quality for feral pig breeding. Due to modelling methods and assumptions, HSI values in this dataset effectively range between 11 and 81. They can be broadly classified as follows: HSI ≥ 60 = highly suitable habitat; HSI ≥ 40 = moderately suitable habitat; HSI < 40 = unsuitable habitat.\r\n\r\nPredicted habitat suitability should not be confused with actual feral pig occurrence. Individuals may be sighted at any time in unsuitable breeding habitat. Conversely, suitable breeding habitat may remain unoccupied. While there is a link between habitat suitability and population density, this may not always be straightforward (i.e. comparable habitat may carry vastly different actual or potential densities depending on the nature and quality of available resources).\r\n\r\nFeral pig habitat suitability in northern Australia was modelled for two seasonal scenarios. The wet season scenario captured favourable conditions during the late wet season, when resources required by feral pigs are generally abundant and widely distributed across the region. It was developed using spatial proxies averaged across two months (March/April) over five years (2010 to 2014). Seasonal model results were validated against four independent distributional data sets.\r\n\r\nUnderlying model parameters were elicited from experts. This dataset represents results from an expert-averaged model run. The model contained a variable \"Disturbance stress\" for which no spatial proxies were available. In this dataset, we assumed a uniformly “high” intensity and frequency of control activities, which likely overestimated disturbance and may undervalue habitat suitability in situations where there is actually little management.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of modelling methods and assumptions is provided in Froese et al. 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177018).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAn antenatal visit is a planned visit between a pregnant woman and a midwife or doctor to assess and improve the wellbeing of the mother and baby throughout pregnancy. An antenatal visit does not include a visit where the sole purpose of contact is to confirm the pregnancy, or those contacts that occurred during the pregnancy that related to other non-pregnancy related issues. An antenatal visit in the first trimester is defined as occurring before 14 weeks' gestational age.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid\n\n\nIn WA and ACT, first antenatal visits that occur outside of the hospital may not be included, so these data should be interpreted with caution\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit for the area is less than 100\n\n",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from a derived dataset (38f3a272-66cc-4fe2-bef9-ff4aedf6fc24). The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is a shapefile for 16 catchments in the Gloucester area selected to calibrate the surface water model. Out of the 16, four contribute to the Gloucester or Karuah river basins, including the Barrington River at Forbesdale (calibration gauge 208006), Gloucester River at Gloucester (208020), Mammy Johnsons River at Pikes Crossing (209002) and Karuah River at Dam site (209018). Of the remaining catchments, five are in the Manning river basin, six are in the Hunter river basin and one is in the Wallis Lake river basin..\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe catchment boundaries were delineated using 1 sect SRTM DEM dataset with 16 selected gauge locations as pour points (see lineage dataset). The new boundaries are better (for modelling purposes) than those delineated using the BOM's Geofabric for all catchments, except for the catchment 209003 where a flaw in the SRTM derived flowpath excluded a valley when compared with the Geofabric. This catchment was manually edited to conform with the Geofabric representation of 209003. Individual contributing area catchments for the 16 selected gauges were then merged into this single shapefile.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) GLO SW Model Calibration Catchments v01.

    "description": "The Biodiversity component of the LTIM Project evaluated the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to achieving diversity-related objectives of the Basin Plan by undertaking a qualitative evaluation of expected outcomes of watering actions undertaken by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO). \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project focused on examining the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan), while assisting the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas:were the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nThe main data output of the Biodiversity evaluation is an aggregated list of species and communities that potentially benefitted from Commonwealth environmental water from 2014-15 to 2018-19. This is derived from other Basin Matter reports (Vegetation, Fish, Ecosystem Diversity), Selected Area monitoring, the Atlas of Living Australia and monitoring programs external to LTIM (e.g. the Living Murray, Bird Life Australia). \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Biodiversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.

    "description": "This research paper and data was released on 1 December 2015, it continues the Commission's investigation of issues relating to the ageing of Australia's population, this time focusing on the housing choices made by older Australians. It considers available statistical evidence on the financial and accommodation aspects of housing decisions and draws out some of the policy issues affecting the wellbeing of older Australians and the broader community.\r\nThe report examines the policies affecting the supply and cost of residential aged care and other age-specific housing, the influence of the tax and transfer system on housing decisions, and the issues in using home equity release to support living standards in retirement.\r\nIn reaching its conclusions, the Commission drew on evidence from a survey of older Australians conducted on its behalf. The Commission engaged RFi Group to conduct a national survey of older Australians on the reasons for housing decisions relevant to this study.\r\nThe survey was conducted online in September 2015, and involved 1500 Australians aged over 60 years. Key results from the survey are presented throughout the report. A more detailed description of survey methodology is given in appendix C.\r\n",

    "title": "Results of benthic organisms, reef fishes and manta tow surveys of Capricorn Bunker reefs in October 2015 (NESP TWQ 3.7, AIMS)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of summaries of benthic, fish and manta tow surveys conducted in the Capricorn-Bunker Region of the Great Barrier Reef in October 2015. It consists of three tables:\n\n1. A table summarising percent cover of benthic organisms grouped into broad categories from photo transects collected during the monitoring surveys.\n2. A table of average abundance for each reef fish species on the 5 transects in each of the three sites on each reef is presented for the eight reefs surveyed.\n3. A table of the average reef wide coral cover, the mean reef-wide density of crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS), Acanthaster planci and the mean reef-wide density of coral trout for each reef based on manta tow surveys.\n\nThis dataset is an extract from part of the AIMS Long Term Monitoring database.\n\nThe rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in 2004 increased the number and extent of ¿no-take¿ areas within the Park. This project surveys pairs of reefs, one in a ¿no-take¿ or green zone and the other a similar reef where fishing is allowed (blue zone), in five regions of the GBRMP. Green and blue zones will be surveyed for the abundance and size of fishery species, particularly coral trout, as well as wider effects on coral reef communities. Surveys of coral communities are undertaken in the same location as surveys of fishes. Biennial surveys commenced in 2006.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nBenthic surveys:\nCoral communities were surveyed on eight reefs (Boult Reef, Broomfield Reef, Erskine Reef, Fairfax Islands Reef, Hoskyn Islands Reef, Lady Musgrave Reef, Mast Head Reef, North Reef (North)) in the Capricorn-Bunkers region using digital still images taken along five permanent 50 m transects in each of three sites per reef (n = 15 transects). Forty images were selected randomly from the fifty taken per transect for analyses. The benthic organisms under five points per image arranged in a quincunx pattern were identified (n = 200 points per transect). Benthic organisms were identified to the highest taxonomic resolution possible and each organism is assigned a lifeform based on its shape. Data were converted to percent cover and the site averages is presented for each reef surveyed. AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10.  The data summaries the latest survey from a time-series of biennial surveys that commenced in 2006. Temporal trends at each reefs are available on http://data.aims.gov.au/reefpage2/allreefs.jsp\n\nReef fish surveys:\nThe abundance of ten families of conspicuous, diurnally active reef fishes was enumerated using standard underwater visual census techniques. Sites are located in a standard reef slope habitat on the north-eastern flank of each reef between 6 to 12m, and consist of five permanently marked 50 m transect (n=15 per reef). Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were surveyed on one metre wide belt transects while the remaining nine families of large mobile fishes (Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Serranidae and Zanclidae) were counted on five metre wide belts. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 3.\n\nManta tow surveys:\nBroadscale surveys of reef-wide coral cover, densities of crown-of-thorns starfish and of coral trout using manta tows involve a snorkel diver being towed around the perimeter of the reef.  The boat stops every 2 min to allow data to be recorded. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 9.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.csv, CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.shp:\nAverage percent cover of groups of benthic organisms on each of 3 sites on survey reefs in the Capricorn-Bunkers, GBR\nDescription of lifeforms are published in the Standard Operation Procedures, Appendix III\nSee: AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10\n\nThe following are the classifications in the dataset:\n- Turf algae\n- Tabulate Acropora\n- Coralline algae\n- Branching Acropora\n- Encrusting non-Acropora\n- Sand\n- Massive non-Acropora\n- Macroalgae\n- Submassive non-Acropora\n- Soft coral\n- Digitate Acropora\n- Arb & Enc Soft Coral\n- Arborescent Soft Coral\n- Capitate Soft Coral\n- Foliose non-Acropora\n- Encrusting Acropora\n- Millepora\n- Branching non-Acropora\n- Submassive Acropora\n- Sponge\n- Other organisms\n- Encrusting Soft Coral\n- Zoanthid\n- Bottlebrush Acropora\n- Dead coral (recent)\n- Rubble\n- Lobate Soft Coral\n- Massive Soft Coral\n- Mushroom coral\n- Abiotic\n- Solitary coral\n- Unknown\nThe shapefile was created from the CSV. This process involved truncating the attribute names to comply with 10 character limit of the shapefile format. The CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.aliases.csv file contains a lookup table that maps the shortened attribute names in the shapefile to the original longer names in CSV file.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Fish_2015-10.csv:\nConsists of a summary of the raw counts of reef fishes. The average abundance for each reef fish species per 1,000 m2  is presented for each of the 3 sites on the eight reefs surveyed in October 2015. Note: this table also includes rows for species that were searched for, but none were observed. These correspond to rows where the abundance is 0.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Manta-tow_2015-10.csv:\nSummary of the manta tow results for the surveyed reefs, including the mean hard coral cover (average over all tows on reef), CoTS (count per tow) and trout (count per tow). \n\n\nData Location:\n\nThis dataset is saved in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\NESP1\\3.7_GBR_Zoning\\",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "title": "Assessment of Swamp Sclerophyll Forest on Coastal Floodplains TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate  (South Coast Region)",
    "description": "The operational map for Swamp Sclerophyll Forest (SSF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast.\nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for SSF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that SSF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of SSF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas. \nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess the floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain SSF. We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of eucalypt, casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of SSF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the SSF determination.\nFollowing this, we developed a predictive statistical model of the probability of occurrence of SSF using plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables. For the north coast, we used a Random Forest model, while for the south coast we used a Boosted Regression Tree model.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to SSF if appropriate based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and modelled probabilities underlying each API polygon. In total, we mapped approximately 1131 hectares of SSF across out study area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "Since the 1980s the managers of alpine resorts have collected information on visitation numbers.  Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

    "description": "<strong><em>This dataset is available on Brisbane City Council’s open data website – <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au\">data.brisbane.qld.gov.au</a>. The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis information provides a graphical representation of the locations of the existing (as constructed) stormwater quality improvement devices (SQID) in the Brisbane City Council local government area.\n\nIt can be combined with other Stormwater data to provide the entire Stormwater Network. Not all assets within the network are owned, and maintained by Brisbane City Council.\n\nA Stormwater Quality Improvement Device or SQID is a device used to prevent polluting materials being transported in stormwater. There are four main types of SQID: Filter, Gross Pollution Trap (GPT), Trash Rack and Wetland. A filter is used to block finer particles and sediments. A GPT is used to block debris typically larger than 3mm. A Trash Rack is a series of metal vertical and/or horizontal metal bars positioned across a drainage channel and designed to intercept litter and debris. A wetland is a naturally occurring area inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater and capable of sustaining vegetation typically adapted for life in such conditions.",

    "description": "The Rental Report time series dataset provides detailed time-series statistics for some key Rental Report data from the June quarter of 1999 to the December quarter of 2017. This specific dataset presents the median rental costs of 1 bedroom flats by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nThe rent figures included in the Rental Report are weekly median rents. Median rents represent the midpoint in the distribution of all rents. Fifty per cent of rents are higher than the median and fifty per cent are below the median.\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "description": "Under the Urban Forest Strategy, there are ten Precinct Plans that provide detailed information about how planting will occur in local streets to meet the objectives of the strategy. A planting schedule for streets in each precinct has been developed in consultation with the community and is based on:\n\n-  Community priorities\n\n-  Location and density of vulnerable residents\n\n-  Opportunities for new planting\n\n-  Hot and very hot streets, as shown in thermal imaging \n\n-  Useful Life Expectancy of existing trees\n\n-  Existing canopy cover\n\n\n\nThis dataset shows the anticipated timeframe for tree planting in each street across the City of Melbourne. This timing is provisional and subject to change. The schedule for some streets may be moved forward or delayed by capital works, developments or renewal projects that impact on tree planting or survival. \n\n\n\nTo learn more about the Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans, visit http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sustainability/urbanforest/pages/urbanforest.aspx",
