    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP after hours in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

KFH was defined to include all marine and estuarine habitats up to highest astronomical tide level (that reached by 'king' tides) and most permanent and semipermanent freshwater habitats including rivers, creeks, lakes, lagoons, billabongs, weir pools and impoundments up to the top of the bank.\nSmall headwater creeks and gullies (known as first and second order streams), that only flow for a short period after rain are generally excluded, as are farm dams constructed on such systems. Wholly artificial waterbodies such as irrigation channels, urban drains and ponds, salt and evaporation ponds are also excluded except where they are known to support populations of threatened fish or invertebrates.\nFeedback or questions relating to Key Fish Habitat Mapping data can be sent to:  fisheries.data@dpi.nsw.gov.au",

    "description": "This dataset provides daily average solar irradiance values for approximately 16,000 building footprints across Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia. It delivers rooftop-level estimates of solar radiation potential averaged by month, enabling rapid assessment of photovoltaic feasibility at the individual building scale.\n\nThe dataset was created to support distributed energy planning by combining Microsoft Bing building footprints (2D) with climate data from CSIRO and http://climate.onebuilding.org , processed through the LBNL Radiance lighting simulation suite. Each footprint includes monthly, daily and hourly averages (W/m²) calculated from hourly irradiance simulations based on TMYx climate files (2004-2018).\n\nThis resource is particularly valuable for building owners and property managers conducting preliminary PV feasibility studies, local governments developing renewable energy strategies, and researchers analysing urban solar potential at building resolution. The daily and monthly average formats provide accessible metrics for comparing seasonal variation and estimating annual energy generation potential without requiring processing of hourly data.\n\nCoverage includes 530 mesh blocks spanning Kalgoorlie, Boulder, and Trafalgar. Values represent rooftop-plane irradiance assuming flat surfaces and do not account for roof tilt, orientation variations, or shading from trees or adjacent structures. For detailed hourly analysis or specific panel configurations, users should reference the complementary hourly datasets in this collection.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for platypus. The data was developed by the University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate scores for platypus presented in the HWS for three scenarios:\n\n<ul><li>Current: habitat suitability for platypus under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.</li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for platypus from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. </li></ul>\n\n\n\nHabitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. \n\n\n\nFurther reading: Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "AusCPR: Phytoplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk. It is thus possible to see the phytoplankton cells directly on the mesh. In essence, the phytoplankton is already concentrated. Washing the phytoplankton off the silks to count in the standard manner may result in loss of or damage to cells before analysis.\nIt is advised that anyone using the data should first read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.  For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal.

Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "The introduced European polychaete Sabella spallanzani  has become a dominant feature of sub-tidal habitats in south-eastern Australia.  This study examines the physical effects of Sabella spallanzanii on macrofaunal assembleges of soft sediments. The effects of S. spallanzanii on:  i) existing macrofaunal assemblege; ii) distribution of larvae and iii) colonisation of macrofauna were tested in sub-tidal soft sediments at Clifton Springs, Bellarine Peninsula, Port Phillip Bay, Victoria.     This dataset gives the macrofauna assemblege of soft sediment cores collected from five replicate plots, in each of four experimental treatments:  i) Real Sabella, a clump of 15 S. spallanzanii individuals transplanted from the surrounding region; ii) Mimic Sabella, a clump of 15 S. spallanzanii mimics;  iii) Control, undisturbed sediment without S. spallanzanii and  iv) Disturbed Control, disturbed sediments without S. spallanzanii.  Plots containing real and mimic Sabella were used to test if changes in the assemblage of macrofauna in the presence of Sabella could be attributed to physical effects alone.  A comparison of control and disturbed sediments was used to test if the disturbance created when transplanting Sabella into experimental plots contributed to any observed changes in the macrofauna assemblage. \n\nComparisons between Real (RS) and Mimic Sabella (MS), and Control (C) and Disturbed Control (DC) treatments were found not to differ significantly for any of the individual taxa or combined groups. Consequently, data from RS and MS treatments were pooled and compared against pooled data from C and DC treatments.  This analysis found that the presence of Sabella reduced the abundance of harpacticoid copepods, cumaceans and ostracods by more than 50% compared with numbers found in sediment without Sabella.  Collectively these taxa made up 80% of the total numbers of individuals in soil cores; as such the total number of individuals was also significantly reduced by the presence of Sabella.",

    "description": "Volumetric estimates of organic carbon being created by photosynthesis or consumed by ecosystem respiration.  Flow-MER deploys data loggers to record changes in dissolved oxygen, light and temperature over the course of 24 hours with continuous recording every 5 minutes. The data is analysed using the statistical model ‘BASEv2’ (BAyesian Single-station Estimation). The model (Grace et al. 2015) was updated during 2016 in accordance with methodological recommendations contained within Song et al. (2016).  Flow-MER converts these BASE volumetric estimates (this data set) into reach-scale estimates with the appropriate hydraulic information (cross-sectional area) to estimate the amount of organic carbon being created by photosynthesis or consumed by ecosystem respiration in a nominal 1 kilometre (km) stream reach at the gauging site.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\nGrace MR, Giling DP, Hladyz S, Caron V, Thompson RM, Mac Nally R (2015) Fast processing of diel oxygen curves: estimating stream metabolism with BASE (BAyesian Single-station Estimation).

    "description": "A Capacity Management Plan (CMP) is one of the strategies that the Department for Education employs to support government schools that are experiencing increased enrolment demand.\nIncreased enrolment demand occurs due to several factors including changes to the demographic profile of the local community and increases in local housing development. The purpose of a CMP is to assist a school to return to, or maintain, a sustainable enrolment level and to assist children to be able to attend their local school.\nThe CMP outlines the enrolment criteria relevant to each school. The Department for Education has been implementing CMPs since 2009. Generally, the CMPs, over a period of time, have supported schools to manage enrolment demand within their school enrolment capacity. Further strategies include the provision of additional accommodation, implementation of a school zone or planning for new educational facilities.\nCMPs are approved by the Minister and published in the South Australian Government Gazette.\nRefer to the Capacity Management Plan webpage \nfor more information and links to the CMPs published in the South Australian Government Gazette.",

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include Reef, Cobble, Silt and Sand. The data was collected through intensive field sampling from January to June 2008 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The use of underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data and a Differential GPS unit allowed for the extensive area to be surveyed.

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in New South Wales (NSW), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of New South Wales connected by Sydney trains (T1-T9) and Metro services (Metro North West line) have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "Building societies became authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) under the Banking Act 1959 on 1 July 1999 when responsibility for their prudential regulation shifted from the States and Territories to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). Since 1 July 1999, building societies have submitted monthly returns to APRA; prior to that date, they submitted returns to the Reserve Bank under the Financial Corporations Act 1974.  In September 2001, APRA implemented new reporting forms for building societies. From October 2001, data are derived from ARF 323.0: Statement of Financial Position (Licensed ADI). Since December 1999, series have only included data for building societies with total assets greater than or equal to $50 million.\r\n\r\nSelected assets:\r\n\r\n‘Cash and liquid assets’ is composed of ‘Cash’, ‘Balances with ADIs’ and ‘Other’. None of these items include bills of exchange, bills receivable, remittances in transit or certificates of deposit.\r\n\r\n‘Cash’ includes Australian and foreign currency notes and coins, gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates held as investments. It excludes loans repayable in gold bullion.\r\n\r\n‘Balances with ADIs’ includes deposits at call with Australian resident banks and other ADIs and settlement account balances due from banks and other ADIs, incorporating receivables for unsettled sales of securities.\r\n\r\n‘Other’ includes deposits at call with Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) and other financial institutions, net claims on recognised clearing houses in Australia, securities purchased under agreements to resell, funds held with the Reserve Bank and other central banks, and settlement account balances due from the Reserve Bank, other central banks, RFCs and other financial institutions, incorporating receivables for unsettled sales of securities.\r\n\r\n‘Government securities’, ‘ADI securities’, ‘Corporate paper’ and ‘Other securities’ include both trading and investment securities. Trading securities are recorded at net fair value. Investment securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for the amortisation of any premiums and discounts on purchase over the period of maturity.\r\n\r\n‘Government securities’ include securities issued by the Australian, State, Territory and local governments and State and Territory central borrowing authority (CBA) securities.\r\n\r\n‘ADI securities’ includes securities issued by banks and other ADIs, but not equity investments in parent, controlled or associated entities.\r\n\r\n‘Other securities’ includes asset-backed securities, other debt securities and equity securities, other than those issued by ADIs, but not equity investments in parent, controlled or associated entities.\r\n\r\n‘Residential’ includes both owner-occupied and investment housing loans to Australian households, net of specific provisions for doubtful debts.\r\n\r\n‘Personal’ includes revolving credit for a purpose other than housing, credit card liabilities, lease financing net of unearned revenue, and other personal term loans to Australian households net of specific provisions for doubtful debts.\r\n\r\n‘Commercial’ includes loans to public non-financial corporations, private trading corporations, private unincorporated businesses, community service organisations, Australian, State, Territory and local governments, ADIs and other financial institutions, net of specific provisions for doubtful debts. Loans to ADIs and other financial institutions includes loans to the Reserve Bank and other central banks, banks, other ADIs, RFCs, central borrowing authorities, fund managers, stockbrokers, insurance brokers, securitisers, mortgage, fixed interest and equity unit trusts and other financial intermediaries.\r\n\r\nSelected Liabilities:\r\n\r\n‘Borrowings from ADIs’ includes settlement account balances due to ADIs and both variable and fixed interest rate short-term loans from ADIs. A loan is reported as short-term if its residual term to maturity is one year or less.\r\n\r\n‘Deposits’ includes retail transaction call deposit accounts held by households, all other transaction call deposit accounts held by entities other than households, deposits from resident banks, resident non-bank financial institutions and intermediaries such as merchant banks, vostro balances from banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), the Australian-dollar equivalent of foreign currency deposits, deposits from controlled and associated entities, retail non-transaction call deposit accounts held by households, all other non-transaction deposit call accounts held by entities other than households, term deposits, certificates of deposit and other forms of deposits.\r\n\r\n‘Other’ liabilities includes settlement account balances due to RFCs and other financial institutions, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, promissory notes or commercial paper with a residual term to maturity of one year or less, other debt securities with a residual term of one year or less, variable interest rate short-term loans from counterparties other than ADIs, fixed interest rate short-term loans from counterparties other than ADIs, debt securities with a residual term to maturity of more than one year, variable and fixed interest rate loans and borrowings from Australian residents with a residual term to maturity of more than one year, interest accrued but not yet paid, interest received but not yet earned, unrealised losses on trading derivatives, items in suspense and other liabilities not separately identified above.

    "description": "    \n\nCalculated annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) potential evaporation (mm) for the\nperiod 1980-1999. Calculated by the Priestley-Taylor method. Interpretation:\nPotential evaporation is an expression of the amount of water that it should\nbe possible to evaporate from an open water surface given the prevailing solar\nradiation, air temperature, and air dryness conditions. Potential evaporation\nis generally high over the Australian continent, significantly exceeding\nrainfall in all but the wettest areas. It is extreme (approaching 10mm/day) in\nthe northern inland in summer. It decreases with decreasing solar radiation,\nthat is with increasing southern latitude and in winter. Potential evaporation\nalso decreases with proximity to coasts, because of increasing cloudiness.\nActual evaporation is controlled by the various resistances to moisture loss\noffered by plants and soil. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation.EvapPT.00, EvapPT.01 a| EvapPT.12 a Mean\nannual and monthly potential evaporation (mm)Data is in albers equal area, and\nunprojected using GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ampe_r9cl\n__01512a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "As part of Phase Two of the National Landcare Program (NLP) the Australian Government’s natural resource management (NRM) investments will be delivered within NLP Management Units. The NLP Management Units dataset is maintained for the purpose of authoritative reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. It is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM investments might be delivered. This dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries (notwithstanding that some boundaries are defined by legislation in some states and territories). It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. Alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future, for example to accord with changes to NRM delivery arrangements or to reflect revisions of state/territory regional boundaries.Current VersionThe 2018 version NLP Management Units dataset contains 58 separate mapping objects. These comprise:56 mainland Management Units. A separate object for Lord Howe Island (part of North Coast, NSW Management Unit) A “Marine NRM” Management Unit which combines Australia's Territorial Sea (from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles) and Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (to 200 nautical miles). It excludes coastal waters (to 3 nautical miles) which are part of the terrestrial NLP Management Units. It also excludes Ashmore & Cartier Islands, Australian Antarctic Territory, Christmas Island, Cocos & Keeling Islands, Macquarie Island, Herd & MacDonald Islands and Norfolk Island, and those parts of Australia's Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone that surround these locations.The 2018 version was derived from the former NRM regions series (latest version was 2017), originally established in 2006 as the “Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries” dataset. No changes to the spatial alignment of terrestrial region boundaries was made in transitioning from NRM regions to NRM Management Units. The principle data fields in the 2018 version dataset are:NLP_MU (note this replaces the former NRM_Region field) State (state, territory or ‘external’for the Marine NRM unit)Area_Description (eg land area only, state and coastal waters, )NRM_ID (as described below)NRM_ID and NLP_MU names, grouped by state/territory, are as follows:New South Wales (11 Management Units + 1 extra map object for Lord Howe Island)1010 Central Tablelands1020 Central West1030 Greater Sydney1040 Hunter1050 Murray1060 North Coast (excludes Lord Howe Island)1061 North Coast - Lord Howe Island1070 North West NSW1080 Northern Tablelands1090 Riverina1100 South East NSW1110 WesternVictoria (10 Management Units)2010 Corangamite2020 East Gippsland2030 Glenelg Hopkins2040 Goulburn Broken2050 Mallee2060 North Central2070 North East2080 Port Phillip and Western Port2090 West Gippsland 2100 WimmeraQueensland (15 Management Units) 3010 Burnett Mary3020 Cape York3030 Condamine3040 Co-operative Management Area (between Cape York and Northern Gulf)3050 Desert Channels3060 Fitzroy3070 Burdekin 3080 Northern Gulf3090 Maranoa Balonne and Border Rivers 3100 Mackay Whitsunday3110 South East Queensland3120 South West Queensland3130 Southern Gulf3140 Wet Tropics3150 Torres StraitSouth Australia (8 Management Units) 4010 Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges4020 Alinytjara Wilurara4030 Eyre Peninsula4040 Kangaroo Island4050 Northern and Yorke4060 South Australian Arid Lands4070 South Australian Murray Darling Basin4080 South EastWestern Australia (7 Management Units)5010 Northern Agricultural Region5020 Peel-Harvey Region5030 Swan Region 5040 Rangelands Region5050 South Coast Region5060 South West Region5070 Avon River BasinTasmania (3 Management Units)6010 North West NRM Region6020 North NRM Region6030 South NRM RegionNorthern Territory (1 Management Unit)7010 Northern TerritoryAustralian Capital Territory (1 Management Unit)8010 ACTExternal (1 Management Unit) 9060 Marine NRMPrevious VersionsThe 2017 version updated the previous version (2016 version 2) with changes to region boundaries in Western Australia and NRM names in Qld, Tas and WA. The 2017 version also removed the NRM_BODY data (added for 2016 version 2) and the non-spatial OceanWatch map label previously included. The 2016 version 2 updated the marine portion of the NRM regions to be consistent with the current (2015) Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System (AMBIS) coastal water limit boundary. It also included a new four digit unique NRM_ID field for sorting purposes. The 2016 version 2 maintained definitions established in the 2015 version, including for the Peel-Harvey NRM region and for the OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation (not spatially defined). It also maintained changes made in earlier versions including: the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas; and the 2012 update/formalisation of the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset.Data to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018",

Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay.

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council has partnered with a number of community gardens around Brisbane to help residents turn food scraps into nutrients for soil.Food waste is a big part of avoidable waste that goes into Brisbane’s general household bins. Composting helps to reduce the amount of food waste we send to landfill, while also reducing the harmful greenhouse gases that are released. It’s also an easy way to experience where our food comes from and shows how valuable our food scraps can be in the cultivation and harvesting cycle.Brisbane’s Community composting hub program encourages residents living near a hub to regularly contribute their food scraps. With support from Council and community volunteer caretakers, residents can learn about the benefits of composting and other ways to reduce the amount of food waste they create.More information on compost and food waste recycling can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/clean-and-green/green-home-and-community/sustainable-gardening/compost-and-food-waste-recycling\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.",

    "description": "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal:- https://portal.aodn.org.au. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. \r\n\r\n A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\n The dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 presents the new NFI classification with three national forest categories, as reported by the NFI in  Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013  (SOFR 2013), and replaces the spatial dataset titled Forests of Australia (2013). The three national forest categories are: Native forest, Industrial plantations and Other forests. The 'Native forest' category has previously been reported by the NFI, however, 'Industrial plantations' and 'Other forests' are new categories for planted forests: 'Industrial plantations', for plantations managed commercially and reported through the National Plantation Inventory (NPI), and 'Other forest' for planted forest not managed commercially or otherwise not reported through the NPI. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's  National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS)  and the  Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) Act 2002.  The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

    "description": "This dataset contains survey data for bird species across various river and wetland locations in the City of Melbourne. Bird transect surveys were conducted by Ecology Australia at the following locations: Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Wildlife Sanctuary (1), Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Tidal Drain (2), Moonee Ponds Creek lower catchment near Racecourse Road, Kensington and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (3), Maribyrnong River near Newells Paddock and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (4), Royal Park Oak Street Wetland (5), and Stony Creek Backwash, Footscray (6). Surveys were undertaken during daylight hours and were repeated on various dates throughout February and March 2018. Bird surveys were conducted by completing transects along the waterbodies and identifying bird species and numbers. These surveys were undertaken to primarily track bird species richness at Site (1) with Site (3) existing as a reference site with comparable habitat characteristics.\n\nThis bird survey dataset includes the bird’s common name, scientific name, the corresponding Victorian Biodiversity Atlas Code, the date the survey was conducted, and the location of the survey (including the latitude and longitude). The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA) is managed by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and provides a list of species observations in Victoria. Each species has an identification ‘code’ number.\n\nPlease get in contact with the Urban Forest and Ecology Team (nature@melbourne.vic.gov.au) if you wish to view the full report by Ecology Australia or if you have any questions about the dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1990. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile of the core (revealing sedimentation rates), the relative abundance of planktonic foraminifera over time, and estimates of historical sea-surface temperatures.",

    "description": "This dataset provides understorey herbaceous biomass, ground cover and overstorey woody cover response to different fire regimes over a twenty year period at a grassland and open woodland in the tropical savannas of northern Australia. BOTANAL was used to assess understorey herbaceous biomass. Woody canopy cover was derived from digital analysis of oblique aerial imagery taken from a helicopter at the site in 1995 and again in 2013. Woody cover (tree basal area and canopy cover) was also assessed using a bitterlich gauge on BOTANAL ground based transects in 2009. The data could be used to calibrate models of herbaceous growth and woody cover change in response to long term fire. It may be useful for assessing climate change impacts on aboveground carbon sequestration. The fire regimes tested were of varying frequency (every 2, 4 and 6 years) and season (June vs. October) of fire compared to unburnt controls on woody cover and pasture composition. Sites were open to grazing by cattle.",

    "description": "Rodrigues is located at latitude 19°43' S and longitude 63°25' E in the Southwest Indian Ocean and features the best developed reefs in the Mascarenes. \n\nIn 2001 a field expedition to Rodrigues recovered six drill cores using a portable hydraulic drilling rig. In all, two cores were recovered from the windward margin (cores 10 and 17), with a maximum depth of penetration of 4 m. Four cores were recovered from the leeward margin (8, 14, 15, 18) where the maximum depth penetration attained was 4.2 m. Recovery ranged from 23 to 63 %.\n\nThin sections were made and examined petrographically. Radiocarbon dating was performed on selected corals from the base of each core interpreted to have grown in situ and to be free from intraskeletal contamination.\n\nRadiometric dating suggests that Rodrigues reefs approached sea level between 3.1 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP and 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. In fact, the windward margin apparently grew to within 2.5 m of present day sea level by approximately 2.7 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. The leeward margin approached modern day sea level more recently between 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP and 2.4 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion for the top 4 m of the cores range from 0.46 - 1.96 m / kyr.",

This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census ran from 15 May to 14 June 2013. Overall, 102,219 employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 66%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_ \r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2013 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2013 employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document. \r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2013 employee census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2013 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2013 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

The percentage of calcium carbonate in samples collected from different depths was analysed, along with other parameters, to determine changes in carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx. The lowest percentage of calcium carbonate was recorded at ~60cm depth corresponding to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

    "description": "This dataset contains all operating licences (OL) under section 74 of the Environment Protection Act 2017. \nAn OL is a type of licence is for a prescribed activity(https://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/in-force/statutory-rules/environment-protection-regulations-2021/) in Schedule 1 of the Environment Protection Regulations 2021. Licensed activities require the highest level of regulatory control within the EPA permissions scheme(https://www.epa.vic.gov.au/about-epa/publications/1799-2) (publication 1799 at EPA website). This is due to the potential high risk of harm to human health and the environment.  \n\nAn operating licence is a type of permission issued by EPA. It is a legal document held by a legal entity, whether a person, a company, a statutory corporation or a municipal council, and contains conditions that regulate the risk of harm to human health and environment from the activity at the OL activity site. These conditions address areas including: risk management, record keeping and reporting, waste acceptance and treatment or disposal, air and water discharges, and noise and odour. This dataset mirrors the operating licence data available on EPA's public register, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date data, go to EPA's public register for permissions(https://www.epa.vic.gov.au/about-epa/public-registers/permissions).",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the nominated Hinterland sand flat forests and woodlands of the Sydney Basin Bioregion found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n* Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n* The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n* Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n* While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

    "description": "MyHospitals provides performance information for public and private hospitals in Australia. You can also compare the performance of these hospitals and find information about hospitals near you.\nThe annual average number of beds available to be used by an admitted patient was grouped into the following categories: fewer than 50, 50-100, 100-200, 200-500 and more than 500. These data are as reported by states and territories to the NPHED, and are referred to in statistical publications (including Australian hospital statistics) as 'average available beds'. The average number of available beds presented may differ from counts published elsewhere. For example, counts based on bed numbers at a specified date such as 30 June may differ from the average available beds over the reporting period. Comparability of bed numbers can be affected by the range and types of patients treated by a hospital. For example, hospitals may have different proportions of beds available for general versus special purposes (such as beds or cots used exclusively for intensive care). Bed counts also include chairs for same-day admissions.\nData is current as of December 2015. Data sourced from: http://www.myhospitals.gov.au/about-the-data/download-data",

    "description": "This data was collected in August 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T03.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS,   Aug 12, 2011\nArrived:   \tFremantle, WA,   Aug 22, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

This review is an update of a study undertaken in\n2010 for the then Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development\nby Access Economics and Gibson Quai-AAS, with an extension of the projection\nperiod out to 2016.\nThe model contains estimates of current (2011) service coverage, demand for\nservices, expenditure and subscriber numbers for 10 telecommunication service\ncategories, as well as forecasts to 2016. The spatial building block of the\nmodel and the lowest level of reporting is at the level of Local Government\nAreas (LGAs). The model also includes broader regional aggregates, and\ndistinguishes between household and business customers.\nThe timing of this modelling exercise, at the early stages of rollout of the\nFederal Government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) and during a period of\nrapid development of new applications for telecommunications technologies, is\ndesigned to capture and identify recent and forthcoming changes in Victoria’s\ntelecommunications markets. The model has been built with the intention that\nit can be updated in future years, to include updated data and to reflect\nemerging market trends.  ",

    "title": "Seabed Biodiversity on the Continental Shelf of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area 2003 - 2006 (CRC Reef, CSIRO)",
    "description": "This very large study is published in Pitcher et al. (2007). Its purpose was to quantify patterns in seabed biodiversity and inter-reefal environmental conditions throughout the GBR.\n\nThe study had three aims: (1) Assessment of seabed biodiversity on the continental shelf of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, and assessment of the use of biophysical data as environmental correlates of biodiversity and benthic communities; (2) Mapping bycatch and seabed benthos assemblages in the GBR Region for environmental risk assessment and sustainable management of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, and (3) Assessment of the performance of acoustic remote sensing for seabed mapping and as a surrogate for biodiversity on the continental shelf of the GBR.\n\nIt contains several large data sets, based on >600 km of towed video, ~100,000 photos, 1150 baited remote underwater videos, echograms, ~14,000 benthic samples, ~4,000 seabed fish samples, and ~1,200 sediment samples.\n\nThe eAtlas has processed the Towed video data into a shapefile [1 MB] for dataset visualisation. This processing was done by combining the start and end tow events from the VESSEL_TASKS_ALL table to create a shapefile (GBR_CSIRO-AIMS_Seabed-biodiversity-2003-2006_DropCam.shp) and CSV (GBR_CSIRO-AIMS_Seabed-biodiversity-2003-2006_DropCam.csv) with a line feature for each tow. The information from tables VESSEL_VIDEO_BIOHABITAT and VESSEL_VIDEO_SUBSTRATUM were added as attributes of the line features based on the matching SITE_ID. \n\n\nFormat:\n\nThe processed data from this study is stored in an Access Database (77 MB). The eAtlas summarised the tow video data into a shapefile [1MB] and CSV files (290 KB). Note the attribute names in the shapefile were truncated to 10 characters due to the limitation of shapfiles.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who needed to see a GP but did not in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

The present study, carried out between 2006 and 2008, updates the classification and mapping of the communities.\nThe survey area included all of the Hornsby LGA, from Eastwood to Brooklyn to Wisemans Ferry, excluding Marramarra NP, Muogamarra NR, Long Island NR, and Ku-ring-gai Chase NP east of the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway.\nIn the initial study, the classification of the plant communities was based on the floristic composition of the tallest vegetation layer (usually the tree species composition). The assessment was subjective but based on species data from a total of 404 sample sites. An additional 209 sites were examined for the updated study. The classification has been refined to include 8 EECs, two rainforest communities (instead of one in the original classification), and recognition of the distinctive vegetation of Dangar Island as a separate community.\nVIS_ID 4471\nPlease note the related datasets:\n1.

If this occurs, the area is put under a moratorium to halt any further development, while the area is further investigated.\nIf it is decided that the area requires water usage monitoring, then the area may be prescribed. When an area is prescribed, the linework is removed from this layer and placed in the Prescribed areas layer. This coverage contains the linework of those areas which are under moratorium. This linework is used as a base for policy and investigates projects to determine whether prescribing is appropriate.

    "description": "The SA Mid-Slope Mooring (IMOS platform code: SAM3MS) is one of five South Australian regional moorings designed to monitor particular oceanographic phenomena in coastal ocean waters. The mooring is located at Latitude:-36.15, Longitude:135.90. It was first deployed in February 2011.\n\nThis mooring in conjunction with SAM7DS are placed directly along the shelf gradient from NRSKAI to the shelf break.  The purpose of these moorings is to monitor the cross-shelf structure of any currents moving along the shelf break.  They are also used to monitor any uplifted ocean water that may be present during the summer upwelling conditions in the SAIMOS region.\n\nThe Mid-Slope Mooring is maintained for 6-8 months each year, during summer/autumn depending on logistics.",
