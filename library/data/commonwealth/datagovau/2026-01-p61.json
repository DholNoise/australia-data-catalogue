    "description": "A study of the response of phytoplankton to rainfall in Sydney Harbour, on the 22nd October 2004, is reported here. Sydney Harbour is an important port and recreational region for the city of Sydney. Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "From 20 October 2023, COVID-19 datasets will no longer be updated.\nDetailed information is available in the fortnightly NSW Respiratory Surveillance Report:  https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/reports.aspx.\nLatest national COVID-19 spread, vaccination and treatment metrics are available on the Australian Government Health website:  https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/reporting?language=und\nCOVID-19 cases by likely source of infection. Publication of some data in this dataset has been suppressed (before 9 March 2020) or is being delayed because the risk of gaining information about an individual in the dataset increases as the number of cases decreases.\nThis dataset has been discontinued from 19 November 2021. NSW Health now reports daily COVID-19 cases as a total of local and overseas cases. With quarantine-free international travel, overseas origin of cases can no longer be determined immediately, but will be included in the NSW Health COVID-19 weekly surveillance reports.\nThe data is for confirmed COVID-19 cases only based on location of usual residence, not necessarily where the virus was contracted. The case definition of a confirmed case is a person who tests positive to a validated specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test or has the virus identified by electron microscopy or viral culture, at a reference laboratory. Data reported at 8pm daily.\nCase counts reported by NSW Health for a particular notification date may vary over time due to ongoing investigations and the outcome of cases under review thus this dataset and any historical data contained within is subject to change on a daily basis.\nThe underlying dataset was assessed to measure the risk of identifying an individual and the level of sensitivity of the information gained if it was known that an individual was in the dataset. The dataset was then treated to mitigate these risks, including suppressing and aggregating data. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth and reported smoking tobacco in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and reported smoking in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, divided by the total number of females who gave birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nSmoking refers to the use of cigarettes or inhaled tobacco.\n\n\nData excludes mothers whose smoking status was not stated.\n\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is self-reported smoking of tobacco.\n\n\nBecause of differences in definitions and methods used for data collection, care must be taken when comparing across jursidictions.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in November 2010, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

Both sets of data were recorded at the same location, the Rib Reef beacon.\n \nThe earlier sequence was derived from data recorded on tape at the station, collected and then uploaded back at AIMS. The second sequence used telemetery to send binary data daily to a computer controlled base station. Data was verified by comparing three sets of the same data, received over three days. The base station passed data to the central computing facility at AIMS for processing. Lightning destroyed this system in 1985.\n\nData recorded: Wind direction (0-360°); Wind speed (km/hr); Air temperature (°C); Barometric pressure (mb); Solar radiation PAR (µE/sec/m²).\n\nOther variables:\nTime of day (e.g. 21:53:54); Day of year (e.g.118); Year (e.g. 86).",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This technical report estimates the responsiveness of demand for structural pine to changes in timber and steel prices. Measures of demand responsiveness can provide valuable insights into the potential implications of changes in policy or market settings on volumes and prices received by producers. The analysis focuses on estimating short-term price elasticities of demand--a formal measure of the sensitivity of demand--to changes in prices in the same quarter or recent past. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The estimates in this report suggest that the importance of timber and steel prices on the quantity of structural timber demanded in the short-run is limited. However, the volume of residential construction activity was found to have a substantial effect for demand of domestically produced structural pine products. In particular, new house commencements explain a great deal of the quarter-on-quarter changes in the quantity of domestic structural pine sales. This confirms the common assertion by industry that house commencements are the primary driver for structural timber demand within Australia. \r\n\r\n Looking forward, changes in consumer preferences, socio-demographic trends and building regulations will likely play a much greater role in the choice of building materials used in housing construction compared with timber and steel prices. Trends suggest consumers are placing more weight on the environmental benefits of structural materials. Changing architectural styles will change the material requirements for a standard home. A global trend towards higher-density living will likely promote a shift toward multi-unit buildings, with recent changes to the National Construction Code opening the way for increased timber use in the midrise construction market, leading to greater timber use in multi-level buildings. \r\n",

The consular mission's dataset was digitized in 2012 from the library of imagery held within Geoscience Australia (GA). Image resolution ranged from 0.15m to 2.5m. The first version of the database presented a combination of known consulates, embassies and high commission located within mainland Australia. It was released on the GA Website in December 2012. In March 2015, the consular mission’s dataset was reviewed by GA. Embassies and high commissions were to be removed from this dataset and were to be presented in a separate database. In May 2015, the consulates dataset was validated against the latest information available from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) website dated 4 May 2015.\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-02-15\n",

    "description": "Site G2 is sampled monthly by the Derwent Estuary Program as part of the  Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated rice</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

Area is not the principal basis for determining the predominant use. The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2016-17</em>.

PBCs (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) are established as an interim measure to represent native title owners and their interests until an RNTBC is formally registered. This dataset shows the boundaries associated with PBCs and RNTBCs where determinations of native title have found native title to exist.",

The synthetic indicators produced by the spatial micro-simulation model (SpatialMSM) are: median income, equivalised disposable median income, Gini coefficient and housing stress. The data has been provided by The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).\nNATSEM's spatial micro-simulation model uses a technique that takes a survey and re-weights it to small area Census data. SpatialMSM18F is the application of the NATSEM Spatial Micro-simulation model using the ABS Survey of Income and Housing 2015/2016 and the 2016 Census of Population and Housing at the SA2 level (Tanton et al. 2011). All the indicators from the SpatialMSM model are synthetic, so there is some model error as well as other error from the survey. Therefore, they are not as accurate as the Census data used.\nFor more information please view the NATSEM Technical Report.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data provided directly from NATSEM.\n\n\nWhere data values are NULL, the data is either unpublished or not applicable mathematically.\n\n\nThe treatment of Not Stated and Overseas Visitor data is to exclude them from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n\nMethodology between the 2016 NATSEM and 2011 OECD data release may have changed, please refer to the technical report for parity status and specific changes.\n\n",

    "description": "The New South Wales Mooring Sub-Facility is part of the Australian National Mooring Network. \n\nThis sub-facility is establishing a transect of moorings and measurements off Sydney, which includes the Port Hacking (Sydney) National Reference Station (NRS). Like the NRS sites at Maria and Rottnest Islands, data has been collected for over 70 years at Port Hacking. The transect consists of three moorings in 65, 100 and 140m of water off Bondi and a mooring in 100m at the Port Hacking NRS, where monthly biogeochemical water sampling is conducted. This region is typically downstream of where the East Australian Current (EAC) separates from the coast, and is often influenced by EAC eddies. Data collection supports research on the marine ecosystems associated with these eddies and, as the sub-facility is located in the most densely populated area of Australia, issues such as water quality, waste disposal, shipping hazards, harmful algal blooms and recreation are also of particular research interest.\n\nThe sub-facility has also deployed two moorings across the shelf at Coffs Harbour in the north of NSW, and a pair of moorings at the Bateman's Marine Park, off Narooma in the south. These moorings will enhance the ANMN coverage along the coast of south-eastern Australia and also provide long term monitoring of the continental shelf region both upstream and downstream of the EAC separation point.",

    "description": "An understanding of coral population dynamics (demography) is needed when designing and evaluating studies that aim to detect the effects of natural and anthropogenic mediated impacts on coral communities, and in particular when making predictions about the likelihood of and speed of recovery from such impacts. This study was undertaken to gather baseline data on demographic processes to improve our understanding of the fundamental population dynamics in relation to recruitment, growth and survival of reef building corals in the Pilbara. Measurements of key demographic processes were carried out annually over two years (April 2014 and March 2015) at Enderby and West Lewis Islands in the Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia. Locations sampled at Dampier Archipelago (where coral populations existed) were relatively unimpacted by bleaching mortality that occurred between 2011-2014. At each location permanent transects were established sufficient to provide up to several hundred tagged colonies in order to derive valid demographic rates (growth, mortality, shrinkage, fragmentation) for individuals of each size class, as well as to allow estimates of recruitment. Censuses were conducted using a combination of wide angle photographs of the permanent transects, detailed field censuses of recruits and adult corals, and direct measurements of tagged colonies. The corals investigated in this study were Acropora millepora, Turbinaria mesenterina and massive Porites spp. (mainly P. lobata and P. lutea). These species were chosen because they were among the most common coral taxa on reefs of the Pilbara, and on many reefs globally, making them fundamental to reef primary productivity and carbonate accretion, and because they have contrasting life histories and susceptibilities to disturbances.",

This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps\">riverine flooding</a> in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nSee some <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information\">frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding</a>.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1. Is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.\n 2. Has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses.\n 3. Is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which:\n   - May involve unstable and/or unpredictable variables and is therefore limited in its accuracy and applicability; and,\n   - Will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.\n\n 4. Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n 5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n 6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n\nAccordingly:\n\n 1. While the information presented on this website attempts to represent what may be experienced during a flood, actual flood events may differ substantially.\n\n 2. This website does not provide a forecast or prediction of future flood events or advice or warnings about floods that may occur in the future or their extent or impact.\n\n 3.

It identifies which areas may be flooded and the probable depth and relative hazard of the water, right down to individual blocks.\n\n\nThis feature service is derived from flood extent model by removing null cells which are less than 6 sqm in size for display purpose in the ACTmapi's Flood Map.\n\n\nImportant notice\n\nThe riverine flood map information on this website is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the sheep (September joining) model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Long Beach in the east, to Huskisson in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 7 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "The National Reef Monitoring Network brings together shallow reef surveys conducted around Australia into a centralised database. The IMOS National Reef Monitoring Network sub-Facility collates, cleans, stores and makes this data rapidly available from contributors including: Reef Life Survey, Parks Australia, Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia), Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (South Australia), Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales), Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service and Parks Victoria.\n\nThe data provided by the National Reef Monitoring Network contributes to establishing and supporting national marine baselines, and assisting with the management of Commonwealth and State marine reserves. \n\nReef Life Survey (RLS) and the Australian Temperate Reef Network (ATRC) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources by coordinating surveys of rocky and coral reefs using scientific methods, with the ultimate goal to improve coastal stewardship. Our activities depend on the skills of marine scientists, experienced and motivated recreational SCUBA divers, partnerships with management agencies and university researchers, and active input from the ATRC partners and RLS Advisory Committee.\n\nRLS and ATRC data are freely available to the public for non-profit purposes, so not only managers, but also groups such as local dive clubs or schools may use these data to look at changes over time in their own local reefs. By making data freely available and through public outputs, RLS and ATRC aims to raise broader community awareness of the status of Australia's marine biodiversity and associated conservation issues.\n\nThis dataset contains records of cryptobenthic fishes collected by RLS and ATRC divers and partners along 50m transects on shallow rocky and coral reefs using standard methods. Abundance information is available for all species recorded within quantitative survey limits (50 x 1 m swathes either side of the transect line, each distinguished as a 'Block'), with divers searching the reef surface (including cracks) carefully for hidden fishes. These observations are recorded concurrently with the macroinvertebrate observations and together make up the 'Method 2' component of the surveys. For this method, typically one 'Block' is completed per 50 m transect for the program ATRC and 2 blocks are completed for RLS - although exceptions to this rule exist.\n\nThis dataset supersedes the RLS specific \"Reef Life Survey (RLS): Cryptic Fish\" collection that was available at https://catalogue-rls.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?uuid=6a56db3f-d1b2-438d-98c6-bd7dd540a4d5 (provision of data was stopped in June 2021).",

    "description": "The 2014 15 Budget is officially available at [budget.gov.au](http://budget.gov.au \"budget.gov.au\") as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2014 15 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* Selected Tables from the Budget Papers – Available after Budget Papers published on budget.gov.au (~7.30pm Budget night).\r\n* Machine Readable Tables from Budget Papers – Available after Budget Papers published on budget.gov.au (~7.30pm Budget night).\r\n* The Portfolio Budget Statement Excel spreadsheets – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n* A Machine Readable CSV of all PBS Excel Spreadsheet Line Items – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate and translated (~8.30pm Budget night). First version published with 10 portfolios ~8:50pm Budget night. Work due to be competed by midday 14 May 2014.\r\n\r\nData from the 2014-15 Budget are provided to assist those who wish to analyse, visualise and programmatically access the 2014-15 Budget. It is the first time this has been done as per [our announcement blog post] (http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2014/04/24/budget-2014-in-data-form \"Budget 2014 in data form blog post\"). We intend to move further down the digital by default route to make the 2015-16 Budget more accessible and reusable in data form. We welcome your feedback and comments below.  Data users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury. \r\n\r\nInformation about the PBS Excel files and CSV\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes. Only the line item data (table 2.2) is available in CSV at this stage as we thought this would be the most useful PBS data to extract. Much of the other data is also available in the Budget Papers 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Agency Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Agency 2014-15 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.2: Programme Expenses and Programme Components.\r\n* Table 3.1.1: Movement of Administered Funds Between Years;\r\n* Table 3.1.2: Estimates of Special Account Flows and Balances;\r\n* Table 3.1.3: Australian Government Indigenous Expenditure (AGIE);\r\n* Tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.2.7 to 3.2.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the csv file ‘2014-15 PBS line items dataset’ was prepared from individual agency programme expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: estimates of general government expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).  Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.      Intra agency charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements; \r\n\r\n2.      Agency expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n\r\n3.       Additional  agencies’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only agencies that are directly government funded are required to prepare a PBS.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the following Portfolios have contributed their PBS Excel files and are included in the line item CSV: 1.1 Agriculture Portfolio; 1.2 Attorney-General’s Portfolio; 1.3 Communications Portfolio; 1.4A Defence Portfolio; 1.4B Defence Portfolio (Department of Veterans’ Affairs); 1.5 Education Portfolio; 1.6 Employment Portfolio; 1.7 Environment Portfolio; 1.8 Finance Portfolio; 1.9 Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio; 1.10 Health Portfolio; 1.11 Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio; 1.12 Industry Portfolio; 1.13 Infrastructure and Regional Development Portfolio; 1.14 Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio; 1.15A Social Services Portfolio; 1.15B Social Services Portfolio (Department of Human Services); 1.16 Treasury Portfolio; 1.17A Department of the House of Representatives; 1.17B Department of the Senate; 1.17C Department of Parliamentary Services; and 1.17D Department of the Parliamentary Budget Office.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by agency and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV as these can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required. If a corrigendum to an agencies PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary. \r\n\r\nBelow is the CSV structure of the line item CSV. The data transformation is expected to be complete by midday 14 May, so we have put up the incomplete CSV which will be updated as additional PBSs are transformed into data form. Please keep refreshing for now.\r\n\r\nPortfolio, Department/Agency, Outcome, Program, Expense type, Appropriation type, Description, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, Source document, Source table, URL\r\n\r\nBudget Paper Tables\r\n--------------------------\r\nWe have made a number of data tables from Budget Papers 1 and 4 available in their original format as Excel or XML files. We have transformed a number of these into machine readable format (as prioritised by several users of budget data) which will be published here as they are ready. Below is the list of the tables published and whether we’ve translated them into CSV form this year: \r\n\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Overview Appendix C Major Intiatives (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Overview Appendix D Major Savings (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 3 Table 5 Reconciliation of underlying cash balance estimates (XLSX, no CSV due to complexity)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 5 Table 1 Australian Government general government receipts (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 5 Table 8 Australian Government general government (cash) receipts (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 5 (online tables) Australian Government (accrual) revenue (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 5 Table 11 Reconciliation of 2015-15 general government (accrual) revenue (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 6 Appendix A Table A1 Estimates of expenses by function and sub-function (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 10 Table 1 Australian Government general government sector receipts payments net Future Fund earnings and underlying cash balance (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 10 Table 4 Australian Government general government sector taxation receipts non taxation receipts and total receipts (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 1 Statement 10 Table 5 Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments (XLSX, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.1 Agency Resourcing (xls, CSV coming)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.2 Special Appropriations (xlsx, CSV coming)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.3 Special Accounts (xlsx, CSV)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 2.2 Average Staffing Table  (xlsx, CSV coming)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.1 Departmental Expenses (xlsx, CSV coming)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.2 Net Capital Investment (xlsx, CSV coming)",

The purpose of this Decision Regulation Impact Statement (Decision RIS) is to recommend a preferred option for improving the NLIS for sheep and goats to meet the National Livestock Traceability Performance Standards. \r\n\r\n This Decision RIS identifies the nature of the problem to be solved and explains the rationale for the preferred option. It also assesses the costs and benefits of all the options under consideration. This Decision RIS follows the guidelines of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in the Best Practice Regulation Guide.

    "description": "The qualities of these data include: (i) sound experimental design to detect a change between confounding factors, (ii) large sample size, (iii) microchipped animals, (iv) validated heamatological processing on the wild Australian lizard Tiliqua rugosa involving a collaboration between wildlife ecologists and veterinary scientists. Its reuse potential may involve a comparative analysis of body size, haematological parameters with other long-lived, medium-sized lizards, ectoparasite studies (Aponomma hydrosauri, Amblyomma libatum) for different host populations, and background justification for ecotoxicological (pesticide) studies in farmland. Using a using a multivariate, one-way nested Type I PERMANCOVA (analysis of covariance) design, body size, blood samples and ectoparasite presence was collected on a total of 119 animals from two different populations in southern Australia. One population was from an intensively managed cropping environment and one was from an adjacent a less intensively managed grazing environment. This study took place in extensive rangelands and the fragmented landscapes of the South Australian Murray Mallee cereal cropland in southern Australia. Adult and juvenile T. rugosa were captured for sampling at one rangeland (baseline) site and three severely modified (severe) landscape-scaled sites (LS1, LS2, LS3) over a large area (68 km × 84 km or 571,200 ha) across the croplands. Two animal sampling designs were used to collect data on physiological health (Design 1: Baseline vs Severe and Design 2 - Severe only). Data collected: Record No., Animal No., Treatment, Habitat Type, Landscape No., Connectivity Class, Age Class, Linear Body Size Index (LBSI), Heterophil (H) Field of View, Heterophil per microlitre, Total White Blood Cell Count, Absolute Heterophil Count, % Heterophil Count, Absolute Lymphocyte (L) Count, % Lymphocytes, H:L Ratio (Absolute), H:L Ratio (%), Absolute Monocytes, % Monocytes , Absolute Other Granulocytes , % Other Granulocytes, % Polychromasia, Snout-Vent Length (mm), Total No. Ectoparasites per Animal.",

    "description": "This dataset contains a false color aerial image mosaic of the City of Melbourne municipal area. False color images render the scene in other colors not seen by the human eye. It is used for the interpretation of natural resources. \n\nThe red tone of the aerial image is associated with live vegetation. Intense reds indicate vegetation which is growing vigorously and quite dense. This image is contains embedded georeferenced information.\n\nCapture Information:\n- Capture Date: 2nd/3rd February 2019\n- Capture Pixel Size: 5cm\n- Map Projection: MGA Zone 55 (MGA55)\n\nAdditional technical information:\nArborCarbon collected high resolution multispectral imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. ArborCarbon have used this multispectral image to create this seamless 20cm false-colour composite showing variation in vegetation condition.\n\nThe multispectral imagery was acquired at 8,000ft above ground level over the City of Melbourne under cloudless conditions between 09:45 and 12:45 on 2nd and 3rd February 2019. \n\nImagery was acquired with the ArborCam system with a ground sample distance ranging from 6 cm/pixel to 25 cm/pixel dependent on the band. Imagery was comprised of 3 broad bands in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and an additional 7 narrow-bands strategically positioned in the visible and near infra-red regions to detect subtle variations and changes in vegetation condition.\nPreview Image:\nSee an example image showing the data quality of the aerial.\n\nDownload TIF: \nDownload file (2GB)",

    "description": "The aim of the Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) facility is to provide access to a range of satellite derived marine data products covering the Australian region.\n\nThe SRS has established a new X-Band reception facility at the Australian Institute of Marine Research near Townsville and upgraded the Tasmanian Earth Resource Satellite Station near Hobart.  \n\nThese stations and facilities in Perth, Melbourne, Alice Springs and Darwin form a network supplying the SRS with near real-time data.  These data are combined and processed to a number of products which are placed on disk storage systems in Melbourne, Canberra and Perth.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has developed a sea surface temperature (SST) product in GHRSST-PP (www.ghrsst-pp.org)  L3P format. The Bureau is developing some other SST products including daily and skin SSTs.\nThese new products and some ¿ocean colour¿ products from MODIS will  gradually become available.\n\nScientific users can access these data products are available through OPeNDAP and THREDDS supported technology and also through interfaces provided by eMII and the SRS (www.imos.org.au and www.imos.org.au/srs).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of employed ophthalmologists and full-time equivalent (FTE) per 100,000 population. The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWD). The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), in conjunction with the national health professional registration boards, is responsible for the national registration process for 14 health professions. The data from the annual registration process, together with data from a workforce survey that is voluntarily completed at the time of registration, form the Department of Health’s National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWDS). Data in the NHWDS includes demographic and employment information (for example, labour force status, location of main job, area of practice, work setting) for registered health professionals. In this report, the data on optometrists and ophthalmologists comes from the NHWDS as reported by AIHW.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nFTE is a measure calculated by dividing an estimate of the total hours worked by employees in an occupation in a week by an estimate of the standard hours worked for optometrists (38 hours per week). The number of FTE is then compared with the size of relevant population to get the FTE 100,000 population.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "title": "TRIAP Franklin 2008 Waterbirds",
    "description": "1) As part of the Tropical Rivers Inventory and Assessment Project (TRIAP), a database of 94,148 waterbird records was assembled, comprising 82,596 records from the TRIAP area and 11,552 records from a surrounding 10 km buffer. These records were sourced from databases for Atlas1 and Atlas2 provided by Birds Australia, 99.1% of which are from the Historical Atlas (pre-1977), the first Field Atlas (1977-1981) or the second Field Atlas (1997-2002).\r\n2) Waterbirds were defined to include species of freshwater and coastal wetlands including in-shore but not off-shore marine species. The TRIAP waterbird fauna comprises 145 species from twenty families, of which 112 species are represented in the database by more than ten records.\r\n3) One TRIAP waterbird species – the Australian Painted Snipe – is listed as threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). Eighty-seven species are listed as \"migratory\" under the EPBCA, 44 species are listed under the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement and 53 species under the China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement. The geographical characteristics of all listed species are summarised for the TRIAP area.\r\n4) In the TRIAP area, the Australian Painted Snipe is an infrequent visitor or perhaps rare resident found more frequently in the more arid south. Its preferred habitat of ephemeral wetlands with a mix of mud-flats and dense low vegetation does not closely match habitats recorded for the species in the TRIAP area, which may reflect the marginal nature of its occurrence in this area. Breeding records in the TRIAP area have been in flooded grasslands.\r\n5) A foraging guild classification based on a classification of foraging substrate, foraging methods and food types is presented in this dataset. Twelve foraging guilds are recognised as occurring in the TRIAP area.\r\n6) No waterbirds are endemic to the TRIAP area. However, the TRIAP area represents a major proportion of the range of the Chestnut Rail, and a major proportion of the Australian range of the Great-billed Heron.\r\n7) A biogeographic classification of TRIAP waterbirds is developed based on breeding distributions. Four classes are recognised: a. species for whom TRIAP is a core breeding area; b. Australasian species for whom TRIAP is marginal to their main distribution; c. Palaearctic / Nearctic migrants – these do not breed in Australia; and d. Non-migratory species with a distribution centre in Asia, or Malaysia including New Guinea. Few species other than vagrants have restricted ranges within the TRIAP area, but there is a weak declining gradient in species richness from east to west.\r\n8) The distribution of waterbird families, foraging guilds and threatened species were compared qualitatively with a 1:250 000 classification of waterbodies into seven units. Although the results are \"noisy\", groups associated with deep water and saline habitats were clearly identifiable. A geomorphic classification of rivers provides only linear data and poor spatial correspondence with waterbird records. Neither classification provides a direct measure of the wetland features most relevant to most species, and whilst quantitative analysis could be pursued, it appears unlikely to identify many definitive habitat relationships.\r\nSee Table 6, section 3.3 of (Franklin 2008) for an explanation of foraging guilds. Note that \"herbivore\" includes the possibility of also being extensively insectivorous, whereas \"insectivore\" implies that herbivory is not a major component of the diet.\r\nSee lineage for more details or refer to: \r\nFranklin DC. 2008.

    "description": "With this proposal we ask time to continue our timing follow-up campaign of pulsars discovered with the MeerKAT telescope. Fourtytwo sources have been discovered in targeted observations of Fermi unidentified point sources, two towards Supernova Remnants, 19 in the Magellanic Clouds, 105 in Globular Clusters and 81 in a survey of the Galactic plane. A large fraction of the new discoveries are recycled pulsars (including a few relativistic systems and several 'spider' binaries), or young pulsars. Timing observations have an essential role in exploiting the full potential of any pulsar discovery, allowing for the precise measurement of rotational, astrometric and orbital parameters which, in turn, give us powerful tools to improve our understanding of the physics in extreme environments as well as of the population of neutron stars as a whole. The UWL receiver of the Parkes telescope is a sensitive, versatile instrument that is allowing us to successfully time these new sources, in the bright-end of TRAPUM discoveries.",

Typically this means removing all water users such as irrigation and towns along with infrastructure such as dams and weirs.\n\nA without development scenario is useful in understanding the extent to which human uses of the river have altered flows.\n\nThis type of model scenario is sometimes known and a “natural case” but this terminology has fallen out of favour over time as a true natural condition scenario would attempt to reflect catchment conditions such as land use, vegetation cover and so on that existed prior to human interventions.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1.

Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n 5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n 6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nAccordingly,\n\n 1.

The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

The Fund is expended in line with provisions within the Act and is administered by the Office for Design and Architecture SA within the Department for Trade and Investment.\nThe Fund enables the South Australian Government to adopt a state-wide approach to strategically implement open space and public realm projects. While supporting the Minister for Planning to acquire, manage and develop land for open space, the Fund provides grant funding opportunities for local government through the Open Space Grant Program.\nOpen Space Grant Program\nAccess to quality public open space continues to be increasingly important to ensure South Australia remains liveable, healthy and sustainable, particularly in the context of increasing residential infill in existing neighbourhoods. During the Grant Program opening period, councils are encouraged to apply for grants, to assist with the purchase and enhancement of public open space, accessible to the community.\nThe purpose of this data is to show the location of Planning and Development Fund investment.

    "description": "The Marine invertebrates collection is currently represented by 23 phyla and holds more than one million specimen lots including 1,700 holotypes, 11,300 secondary types, 33,000 registered lots and 1,400 microscope slide preparations.  Specimens include molluscs, crustaceans, worms, sponges, jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, sea stars and sea urchins.\nOf these specimens about 5,500 have been databased and are accessible through the Atlas of Living Australia, more than 1500 of them with digital images of the specimen and label.\nThe SA Museum manages this dataset using the KE EMu collection management system. It is interpreted into the Darwin Core metadata schema (DwC) and semi-regularly exported to the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (OZCAM). \nData sourced from Australian museums on both the ALA and OZCAM should be identical, but on ALA they are combined with observational data from citizen science initiatives and other sources. Both of those sites make it possible to combine, interrogate and analyse data through web services such as the Spatial Analysis Portal. In the Spatial Portal ALA data can be combined with meteorological and other environmental data sourced from and made accessible by relevant government agencies.\nThe ALA also has a fully documented API\nThe Museum has also been using the ALA's Online Volunteer Digitisation Portal, DIGIVOL to digitise the data for Marine Invertebrate specimens. To facilitate this a large quantity of specimens have been imaged.\nData about endangered species are either withheld from online publication, or coordinates or other data are obscured on the ALA and OZCAM. In those circumstances more specific information is available directly from SA Museum collection managers if it is genuinely required for research purposes.\nSA Museum data can be downloaded in full from the Atlas of Living Australia, or broken down into discipline specific parts (e.g. Herpetology, Mammalogy etc). On download the ALA will request an email address (not mandatory) and a reason for download (mandatory) – this is required to track usage of the ALA data to help data providers determine priorities for upload and improvement.

    "description": "    \n\nFactor Most Limiting Yield (acidity/sodicity/salinity) dataset is one of 11\nnational surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic\nopportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in\n1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a06.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

Funded through Australian Governement Initiatives (Energy Security Program). The Faust Capel Basins survey GA-2436/ TAN0713 was acquired by Geoscience Australia onboard the RV Tangaroa (operated by NIWA) from the 6th of October to the 22nd of November 2007. The geographic range stretched from Wellington to the Faust Capel Basins to Lord Howe Island and back to Wellington. Approximately 8,945 sailing km of multibeam bathymetry was acquired. The high resolution bathymetry data imaged seafloor features in unprecedented detail, revealing the effects of recent magmatic activity and fluid migration on the seafloor. It also produced a new image of a flat topped unexplored seamount. A member of the Lord Howe Rise seamount chain.\n\nThis dataset is not to be used for navigational purposes.",

    "description": "The overall aim of this project was to determine the geomorphological and sedimentary characteristics (biological and physical) of the Ningaloo Reef and shelf, and to identify evolutionary characteristics relevant to the maintenance of marine biodiversity. This included characterising reef growth history, coastal and seabed geomorphology, surficial sediment facies and their influence on the distribution of benthic habitats. This research presents an interdisciplinary study that provides an important baseline for future habitat mapping, biodiversity assessments, spatial planning, and fisheries management. The characterisation and mapping of benthic habitats based on physical parameters is central for the ongoing monitoring, management and conservation of the NMP’s inshore and offshore resources, particularly during a time of increasing anthropogenic and environmental pressures.",

The data combines aspects\nfrom the themes of Land Parcel and Property, Administrative Boundaries and\nGeocoded Addressing into the new feature class. This product does not form part\nof the dynamic DCDB cadastral web service. The Strata Hub product is updated in\nparallel to its source datasets. The data provides strata plan and strata\nscheme details along with geocoded address data in reference to real-world\nproperty locations, mapped against SP polygons. The Strata Hub data is an\nindicative representation of registered strata plans in NSW. Strata Hub\ncontains registered land titles only.\n\n\nUse Limitations  \n\nThe creation of the Strata Hub data\nemploys industry levels of rigour, skill, and care in ensuring the relevance,\ntimeliness, accuracy, coherence, interpretability, and accessibility of this\ndata. But is does not guarantee the data is without errors, additions, or\nomissions.\n\nData products produced are for the Strata\nHub service only and should be considered indicative and for representational\npurposes only. All attention has been applied to ensure DCS Spatial Services data\naligns to that of the Strata Hub service proper. This data may be used in\nconjunction with cadastral and addressing authoritative datasets for\nvisualisation purposes. DCS Spatial Services may at its sole discretion change\nthe type(s) or spatial datasets or layers that it makes available. \n\nThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway.\n\nAssociated Resources\n\nResource: NSW Geocoded Addressing Theme\n\nThe Geocoded Urban and Rural Addressing\nSystem (GURAS) is a ‘property’ based address database. Each property polygon\ncaptured within GURAS has a unique numeric identifier and contains at least one\nauthoritative address which is sourced from local councils via the valuation of\nland database, also managed by LPI-Valnet. Properties may contain more than one\naddress sourced from various other organisations.\n\nResource: NSW Land Parcel and Property\nTheme\n\nNSW Land Parcel and Property Theme Lot is\na polygon feature that defines a parcel of land created on a survey plan.\nParcel polygons are defined by a series of boundary lines that store recorded\ndimensions as attributes in the lines table. It visualises these boundaries of\nland parcels, often buildings on land, the parcel identifier, and basic\ntopographic features.\n\nResource: NSW Administrative Boundaries\nTheme\n\nThe Administrative Boundaries theme\nfrom NSW Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF) is a collection of legislative, regulatory,\npolitical, maritime, and general administrative boundaries sourced\nfrom local and state boundary datasets.",

    "title": "Economics of Australian Soil Conditions 1996/97 – Gross Benefit Acidity ($/ha/yr)",
    "description": "    \r\n\r\nGross Benefit Acidity (gb97a = p97a a pfe97) ($/ha/yr) dataset is one of 11\r\nnational surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic\r\nopportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in\r\n1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\r\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\r\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\r\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\r\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\r\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\r\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\r\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\r\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\r\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\r\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\r\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\r\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\r\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\r\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\r\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\r\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\r\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\r\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\r\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\r\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\r\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\r\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\r\nTreatment Data is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\r\n__08312a01.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Wetlands are a crucial part of the natural environment. Wetlands provide breeding and feeding habitat for waterbirds, fish, invertebrates and plants. Wetlands may be natural, or human made. The water in a wetland can be still or flowing, and can be fresh, brackish or saline. \n\nThe WSP Prescribed Wetlands for unregulated river water sharing plans (Inland NSW) have been identified by the department as being suitable for listing under water sharing plans to protect their water from future extraction above currently permitted levels. \n\nThe wetlands include those that are recognised under the International Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar), areas that form part of a listing on the Directory of Important Wetlands of Australia (DIWA) or have been identified as receiving protections under a prior water sharing plan. Wetlands identified within Floodplain Management Plan Management Zones D or SP may be added following further consultation with affected stakeholders.  \n\nThis data generates an interactive map of wetlands (including lakes and billabongs), considered significant for the purposes of new water supply works and trade rules in inland unregulated water sharing plans. In NSW, all surface and groundwater is managed under water sharing plans (WSPs). WSPs cover large catchments and are subordinate to the Water Management Act 2000. A WSP has rules which can help to protect identified wetlands. \n\nThe wetlands were identified through a method developed by the NSW government in 2023 and refined in 2025. The method is not intended to identify all wetlands in a catchment. \n\nThe types of wetlands in this data set are those which have been previously assessed as important and/or have a water body that is persistent for at least 3 to 4 months following inundation.  \n\nThis data asset can be used by landholders, conservationists and others to understand the location of wetlands subject to WSP rules, including rules to restrict construction of new water supply works and trades. The spatial data asset complements relevant pdf maps of such wetlands for remade individual inland river unregulated WSPs (available on DCCEEW Department website). \n\nPLEASE NOTE: In the case of any discrepancy between this digital dataset and the published Water Sharing Plan (accessible on the www.legislation.nsw.gov.au site) the instrument as made by the Minister remains the authoritative source and should be used to both interpret the intent of the Plan and in subsequent decision making. Best endeavours have been made in collating relevant Water Sharing Plan boundary and attribution contained in this dataset. However, no warranty is provided as to the accuracy or currency of this representation. The department does not warrant and is not liable for the use of this material as per the licenced sharing conditions CC-BY 4.0. \n\nThis dataset does not include the separate “Significant Wetlands” data set initially used for six other water sharing plans replaced in 2024. The “Significant Wetlands” layer is intended to be reviewed, updated, renamed and eventually added to this WSP Prescribed Wetlands data set to make a single comprehensive WSP Prescribed Wetlands layer for all inland unregulated water sharing plan areas. At that time, the “Significant Wetlands” layer will become redundant. \n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

    "description": "This stochastic climate dataset relates to the <strong>Lachlan</strong> region.\n\nThe stochastic data are 10,000-year daily data sets of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration generated using observed data sets combined with palaeo-logical climate data. This work has been undertaken by researchers at University of Adelaide and University of Newcastle and used in Regional Water Strategies.\n\nThe climate for each climate variable is uploaded as a single ZIP file, which includes three files:\n<ol>\n<li>a .csv file of daily climate data of 10,000 years (format: date, data; filename starts with station ID)</li>\n<li>a pdf file of the meta data of the climate data describing the geographic location of the climate station, data type, period of observed data used for generating stochastic data, a location map.</li>\n<li>a pdf file of the quality assurance information.</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe climate variables include one or more of the following: rainfall, evapotranspiration (Mwet: Morton’s wet area potential evapotranspiration, Mlake: Morton’s lake evaporation, Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (FAO56)), Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature. \n\nNote: Among the available ZIP files listed below, you will find one large “All Stations Full Package” ZIP that contains every station’s dataset in a single complete package, as well as many smaller ZIP files, each containing the data for an individual station only.\n\nNote: Within each ZIP file, the number seen within the filename i.e.  9093_SILO_Rain.zip represents the Station ID Number 59093.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2014.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "The operational map McKies Stringybark/Blackbutt Open Forest (MSBOF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) reviewed the determination for MSBOF and agreed upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification. These parameters included the presence of lateritic soils and the characteristic eucalypt species Eucalyptus mckieana and Eucalyptus andrewsii.  Using these diagnostic parameters, we assessed whether MSBOF is present within more than 150 000 hectares of state forests within the Upper and Lower North East IFOA areas of the Nandewar and New England Bioregions. We began the assessment process by examining the distribution of Eucalyptus mckieana records in NSW Bionet and other available systematic plot data characterising regional vegetation patterns. We then used the results of a recently completed vegetation mapping in the region (OEH, 2015) to provide an indicative map of related vegetation communities within State Forests. From this initial investigation, we identified three state forests as candidate areas for MSBOF within the Project Study area – Mount Topper, New Valley and Clive State Forests. We collected systematic plot data from these state forests in mapped communities related to the TEC and from within stands of vegetation dominated by the primary eucalypt species described in the determination.\nOn this basis we identified four plots within Mount Topper State Forest as being MSBOF TEC and went on to construct an operational map at a scale commensurate with the needs of forestry field operations. In total, we mapped a total of 201 hectares of MSBOF, 101 hectares of which were contained in the IFOA area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "title": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) still images - Caswell Sub-basin, Browse Basin Marine Survey (GA0345/GA0346/TAN1411)",
    "description": "Geoscience Australia (GA) conducted a marine survey (GA0345/GA0346/TAN1411) of the north-eastern Browse Basin (Caswell Sub-basin) between 9 October and 9 November 2014 to acquire seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the basin. The survey, undertaken as part of the Department of Industry and Science's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP), aimed to identify and characterise indicators of natural hydrocarbon or fluid seepage that may indicate compromised seal integrity in the region. \n\nThe survey was conducted in three legs aboard the New Zealand research vessel RV Tangaroa, and included scientists and technical staff from GA, the NZ National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research Ltd. (NIWA) and Fugro Survey Pty Ltd. Shipboard data (survey ID GA0345) collected included multibeam sonar bathymetry and backscatter over 12 areas (A1, A2, A3, A4, A6b, A7, A8, B1, C1, C2b, F1, M1) totalling 455 km2 in water depths ranging from 90 - 430 m, and 611 km of sub-bottom profile lines. Seabed samples were collected from 48 stations and included 99 Smith-McIntyre grabs and 41 piston cores. An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) (survey ID GA0346) collected higher-resolution multibeam sonar bathymetry and backscatter data, totalling 7.7 km2, along with 71 line km of side scan sonar, underwater camera and sub-bottom profile data. Twenty two Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) missions collected 31 hours of underwater video, 657 still images, eight grabs and one core. \n\nThis catalogue entry refers to Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) still image data acquired during survey GA0345/GA0346/TAN1411.\n\nFollowing mapping with the shipboard multibeam, higher-resolution multibeam data were acquired in targeted areas using a Kongsberg Simrad EM2000 system mounted to the Fugro Echo Surveyor V (ES-5) AUV. This instrument had a depth rating of 3000 m, and surveyed the seafloor according to a pre-programmed mission plan. The AUV was fitted with a camera and light system designed to produce images of equal width and height (in the context of this survey, the images comprised 8 m by 8 m of seafloor). The equipment consisted of a light sensitive NEO 11 Megapixel 35 mm monochrome CCD (4008 x 2672) camera and two LED panels, each comprising 360 LEDs. High-resolution multibeam bathymetric data was collected together with side scan sonar and sub bottom profile data at an elevation of 30 m above the seafloor, and at line spacing's of 100 m. Overlapping high-resolution still photographs (captured every second) were then acquired on the survey lines at an elevation of 8 m above the seafloor. The AUV was equipped with an advanced real-time Aided Inertial Navigation System, which calculated the position, velocity and altitude of the vehicle and a HiPAP 500 USBL system was used to acoustically position the AUV.\n\nUnderwater imagery was collected from two AUV missions in study Areas 3 and 4. During the 2nd AUV mission on 22 October, the vehicle encountered an obstruction on the seabed and became trapped despite commencing an emergency ascent sequence. The AUV was subsequently recovered from the seabed during salvage operations incorporated into the ROV phase of survey operations. \nA total of 24 877 still images were acquired in Area 3 and 20 743 in Area 4 over 58 and 56 line kilometres, respectively. Still images (.jpg files) are located in folder 'TAN1411_AUV_STILLS' with sub-folders named according to gear code (AUV= Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), mission and study Area (e.g. AUV_M2_A3 = still images acquired during AUV mission 2 in Area 3). USBL (Ultra-short baseline) text files (`TileCam.idx) are located in each sub-folder and provide continuous navigational information on location, time (UTC) and depth of AUV still imagery transect lines.",

The altered wind fields will have a strong influence on the wind wave climate and in the generation of storm surges.  The combined effects of an altered wind wave climate and the magnitude and frequency of storm surges together with relative sea level rise would have important implications for coastal stability and vulnerability.  \nIn this project the output from the Woodside Energy North Australian Climate Change Study (NACCS) will be used to force wave, storm surge and sediment transport models to predict changes in beach stability under different climate change scenarios. \nA key facet of the project is development of a capacity to link science and management. This will be done through direct delivery of regional and sub-regional scenarios for climate change to Local and State Government agencies, in particular, the Department of Planning and Infrastructure for consideration in preparation of policy for coastal management in response to climate change.",

    "description": "The South Australia Gulfs (SAG) HF ocean radar system covers the area of about 40,000 square kilometres bounded by Kangaroo Island to the east and the Eyre Peninsula to the north.  This is a dynamic region where warm water from the remnants of the Leeuwin current is moving from the west, and water with varying density is exchanging with Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St Vincent.  Upwelling events occur from the deep ocean on the south side of the observation area.  This is a key ocean area for aquaculture and fishing, and is a major shipping thoroughfare.  The data from this HF ocean radar system link the dynamics of the Great Australian Bight to the Bonney Coast and on to Tasmania. \n\nSpecific research questions identified by the SA Node of IMOS are: What is the detailed connection between shelf currents and the Flinders Current to non-regional influences (e.g. Southern Ocean, WA)?  What is the nature of oceanic currents and processes (e.g. wave drift, mixing, eddies) that drive both winter and summer cross and along shelf exchange including the summertime upwelling systems and flushing of the gulfs?  How does the ocean circulation, wave drift, eddies and environmental variability affect the distribution of sediments, nutrients, the production of lower trophic levels\n(phytoplankton and zooplankton), the dispersal of larvae that underpin productive fisheries in the region and the effects of environment on aquaculture\n\nThe SAG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Cape Wiles (34.943 S, 135.681 E) and Cape Spencer (35.294 S, 136.879 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nMost of the capital was contributed by the South Australia Research and Development Institute.",
