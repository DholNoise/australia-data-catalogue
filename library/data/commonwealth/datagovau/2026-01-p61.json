    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "The Climate Science Initiative (CSI) State temperature projection 20km bias corrected dataset has been produced as part of the Climate Science Initiative program. This dataset contains maximum temperature projections.\n\nClimate projection data is available at a 20-kilometre resolution representing the monthly average maximum near-surface air temperature (at 2m) for annual and seasonal time slices (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) over 5 time periods including:\n\n•   Baseline (1990-2009)\n\n•   2030 (2020-2039)\n\n•   2050 (2040-2059)\n\n•   2070 (2060-2079)\n\n•   2090 (2080-2099)\n\nProjections represent two emissions scenarios, SSP1-2.6 (a ‘low’ emissions scenario) and SSP3-7.0 (a ‘high’ emissions scenario). The results are presented as a mean, minimum and maximum result of the NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) ensemble (representing 10 Global Climate Model results) for each gridded point, as well as a standard deviation to reveal the statistical range between model results.\n\nRelative change files (difference between the future and baseline prediction) are also available for each of the calculations i.e. annual and seasonal mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum. \nThe data is bias corrected, and users are encouraged to read the CSI technical fact sheet for further information on this, and data limitations. It also includes background information on the project and datasets, explanations of technical terms such as Global Climate Models (GCMs), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and further information about the projections. It also contains important advice regarding using the data appropriately.  \n\nFuture updates to this dataset may include regional and global climate model specific data at a 4-kilometre resolution, as well as a third ‘middle of the road’ scenario (SSP2-4.5). \n\nThe data naming protocol is outlined in the technical information factsheet available under Data and Resources. \n\n•   Frequently asked questions - https://www.wa.gov.au/service/environment/environment-information-services/climate-science-initiative-frequently-asked-questions\n\n•   Climate Science Initiative - https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-water-and-environmental-regulation/climate-science-initiative",

    "description": "A CYG area is an area or precinct where EPA knows groundwater has been contaminated by:\n    • an activity\n    • waste\n    • pollution\n    • contaminated land.\nCYG areas are where contaminant levels threaten one or more environmental values.\nThe groundwater in a CYG area may not be suitable for some uses. It may be harmful to human health and the environment.\nIt's important for anyone who wants to use groundwater in CYG areas to test it to make sure it's safe to use.\nEach CYG area has a status to help you understand how much groundwater investigation and clean-up has been done.\nEPA assigns a CYG area one of 3 statuses:\n    1. Post remediation – clean-up of groundwater has been done, but some groundwater contamination remains. All former groundwater quality restricted use zones (GQRUZs) have this status.\n    2. Under assessment – further monitoring, evaluation and/or remediation of the groundwater is expected.\n    3. Precinct – the source of groundwater contamination is not clear. There's evidence it comes from multiple sites. Clean-up of the groundwater cannot be effectively completed.\nWhen a particular area is not captured by a CYG area, it does not mean that the groundwater there is suitable for use. The groundwater may not have been tested. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the CYG area data published. EPA will not be held liable or responsible for any errors, or for any loss incurred from reliance on this data. For further information about a particular CYG area, refer to the accompanying assessment report (where available) or contact EPA.",

This can include age; relatives eg: parents, wives, husbands, children; date of death,  where lived (from headstone) plus denomination, Officiating clergyman, date of burial, name of Undertaker, residence of friends (if known), remarks (if any), grave number section and subsection (from Register).\nThe Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia. A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.\nThe dataset contains: a csv file with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.  \nThe transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including:\n\nSome cards are missing\nTranscripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information\nSome cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not\nSome of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card\nAs the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.\n\nIt is still a very valuable dataset as it contains a wealth of information about early settlers in Western Australia. It is of particular interest to genealogists and historians",

    "description": "This report describes a newly proposed method and dataset used by ABARES to measure output, input and total factor productivity in the Australian agriculture industry. We apply recently-developed statistical methods to a novel dataset, compiled from Australia's national account statistics and farm surveys. \r\n\r\n The results show agricultural productivity grew at 2.0 per cent a year between 1948-49 and 2013-14. This work provides a unique measure of the productivity performance of Australia's agriculture industry over time, and thereby provides insight into trends in farm performance and the effects of policy reforms.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who had an episiotomy when giving birth for the first time and giving birth vaginally and non-instrumentally, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their first baby who had an episiotomy during a non-instrumental vaginal birth, divided by the number of females having their first baby who gave birth vaginally and had a non-instrumental vaginal birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth for the first time and had a vaginal birth, with or without instruments. Females who had a multiple birth are included if this was the first time they had given birth.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who did not give birth for the first time or gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nNon-instrumental vaginal births include spontaneous vaginal and vaginal breech.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, a combined laceration and episiotomy value could be recorded; from 2014 onwards, episiotomy could be recorded separately.\n\n\nData were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset shows land parcels owned by Melbourne Water that have potential to be utilised for liveability related projects. The data does not provide a guarantee that the land can be used, or used by any particular activity. Authority to use the land will still need to be assessed and granted by Melbourne Water. Due to the restrictive nature of potentially using land containing assets such as pipes, pits, retarding basins etc the land has been classified into three landuse types. These types describe the potential for using the land area for different purposes. Land classified as \"A\" (or \"Likely Available\") are those area that are likely to be available for community projects and could be used for a variety of purposes depending on the space. Land classified as \"L\" (or \"Restrictions Apply\") are areas likely to be available for small scale or portable infrastructure such as park benches, goal posts, landscaping and temporary food vans. They are unlikely to be available for large scale infrastructure due to access, drainage, safety, current lease or licence agreements or other requirements. Land classified as \"X\" (or \"Access Only\") are areas likely to be available for access related activities such as walking, running or yoga. 24 hour access is usually required and infrastructure is unlikely to be permitted. To apply, visit: Our Space Your PlaceApproximately 100 Melbourne Water asset datasets were used in the creation of this dataset.

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sector report is the annual agency survey (AAS). \r\n\r\nThe 2013 AAS collected information on the application of [Commissioner’s Instruction No. 7 – Code of Ethics](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/document/commissioners-instruction-no-7-%E2%80%93-code-ethics), agency codes of conduct and general principles of human resource management and public interest disclosure at June 2013 or for the 2012/13 financial year. The survey was sent to chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief employees of all public sector entities, including Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, all 110 public sector entities completed the survey.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    AAS 2013.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant entities to access online\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission AAS 2013 data.xls – individual agency responses to the AAS, with a question key and response key. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission AAS 2013 data.sav – individual agency responses to the AAS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of AAS data is available in the [State of the sector statistical bulletin](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/document/state-sector-statistical-bulletin-2013). \r\n",

This data contains observation data made by Parks employees during their research of the crazy ant colonies on Christmas Island in 2001. \nEach of the points represents a surveyed crazy ant site in 2001.  Using field methods (e.g. number of ants running across a sheet of paper), Parks employees estimated the concentration of ants at each site. The results were then represented as total ants and incorporated into the shapefile ‘crazyant_grid.shp’. \nIn September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected the Crazy Ants shapefiles to the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY shift (X=550015, Y=8780001).\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The digital State Boundaries and their legal identifiers have been derived from the cadastre data from each state and territory jurisdiction and are available below.\r\n\r\nState Boundaries are part of Geoscape Administrative Boundaries, which is built and maintained by  [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using authoritative government data. Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

It comprises a digital map showing the locations of raised beach sequences (represented by polygons) and a linked digital database containing additional information. Does not conform to Geoscience Australia's Data Dictionary as too detailed.\n      \nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2006 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

This is the minimum size of a lot that may be created by subdividing land under the LEP. However, it may be subject to certain exceptions under other provisions of the LEP. The LSZ dataset describes the minimum subdivision lot size for individual pieces of land. When a lot is subdivided into one or more lots, each resultant lot area must be greater than or equal to the specified minimum subdivision lot size of the parent land parcel.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset.\n The Land Application data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB. The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in October 2011, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "The Super Tuesday Bike Count is Australia's biggest visual bike count and originated in Melbourne in 2007. The count takes place from 7am to 9am on the first Tuesday in March when volunteers in the state capitals count cyclists at particular locations.\nNationally, the survey is organised by the Bicycle Network (Victoria) and provides reliable, annual figures on bicycle commuters and their movements during morning peak-hours: how many riders there are and which routes they use. By being counted annually, Super Tuesday helps track long-term patterns and identifies tangible results from network improvements. This count supplements the City of Adelaide cordon counts (undertaken each October by Adelaide City Council and the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure) and the permanent counters, which are located at six locations on the edges of the city.\nThe count is conducted by volunteers who record bike rider movements on a count sheet.",

The forecasts refer to the 30 June in each stated year.\n\nWA Tomorrow includes a forecast range (A to E), indicating five probable futures. A and B contain the lower forecasts, C is the median forecast and D and E represent the higher forecasts. For the user who requires the best estimate of future population size, C should be used.\n\nPlease refer to the WA Tomorrow Summary Report for more information.",

By animating time-based data, it can be visualised at each step, highlighting patterns or trends emerging over time.Spatial Collaboration Portal map layers that are time-enabled include different information for the same location at different times.When a dataset contains time enabled layers, it is “time aware” and can be configured to display the data during a specific period or to animate the data over a selected time. Time animation can be enabled in the map viewer using the time slider tool.Features included in Property Address History Service. Address PointPro PointWaypointPropertyProperty FragmentAddress String (table)Property Lot (table)To see how Address, Property and Lot Geometry data and Tables can be joined together download the Data Model Document. This will show what attributes in the datasets can be linked.How to use the animated time featureOpen the “Map Viewer”.Select the time-enabled feature from the contents.Select the “Configure” button (the icon to the bottom right that looks like two slider controls) to open time settings.Select “Show Advanced Settings”Choose your desired playback speedChoose a time and date for “Start Time” and “End Time”. Note.

This GIS calculated area will not be the same as the gazetted area or acquired area.\nThe following is the description of layers included:<ul><li>The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Estate database provides information on areas reserved under the NP&amp;W Act 1974. Areas include National Parks, Nature Reserves, Regional Parks, State Conservation Areas, Aboriginal Areas, Historic Sites and Karst Conservation Reserves.</li><li>Land Vested in NPW Act Minister - acquisition of land for reservation - Boundaries of areas in NSW which are vested in the Minister administering the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 under Part 11. The majority of lands included in this dataset are acquired by the NSW NPWS but not yet gazetted as formal reserve. This dataset is known internally as NPWS Acquired Not Gazetted.</li><li>Land Vested in NPW Act Minister - acquisition of land for management and other purposes - Boundaries of areas in NSW which are vested in the Minister administering the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 under Part 11.

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2018 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions.

    "description": "Locations of over 31,000 types of minerals throughout NSW, including coal, gas, gemstones and construction materials. This spatial dataset is a derivative product of the New South Wales Mineral Occurence Database (also known as New South Wales MetIndEx). It records over 31,000 known mineral occurrences throughout NSW. These records have been compiled from resource and production data compiled from both historic and current mining operations records held by the Geological Survey of NSW. Data records start from a state-wide Metallogenic Mapping program developed by the Survey in the late 1960s and are continuously improved via mandatory reporting. The alternative name MetIndEx refers to the METallics, INDustrial minerals and Exploration discoveries database of economic mineral deposits and occurrences in New South Wales. The data has been migrated over various databases from Microsoft Access to Oracle and SQL Server. The location data has also had multiple datum changes since the original database was compiled. The data is being continuously improved and refined by the custodians on an irregular basis. This data is part of the New South Wales Geoscientific Data Warehouse (NSW GDW) series.",

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.",

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Resource Management in Asia-Pacific (RMAP) Program based at The Australian National University in Canberra.\n*****\nFundamental ontological differences between scientific and indigenous ecological knowledge systems in coastal Melanesia have resulted in very different conclusions being drawn from similar sets of observations. The same inductive logic may lead both scientists and non-science-trained fishers to conclude that, say, square-tail trout aggregate at a certain phase of the moon in a certain reef passage, but different assumptions derived from disparate ontologies (in this case 'traditional' Melanesian versus scientific) may lead to very different conclusions about why the fish are there. In some cases these differences have significant implications for the way marine resources are exploited, and managed (or not). Examples are presented here of non-scientific ontologies that underpin local beliefs about the biology or ecology of fished organisms that have led to poor management of stocks of these species. The potential for scientific education to 'fill gaps' in indigenous knowledge systems (and vice versa) and thus lead to improved management is discussed in the light of some claims that scientific and traditional knowledge systems are incommensurable. The heuristic value of the purported absence of a (Cartesian) dualistic separation of nature and culture in traditional Melanesian cosmologies (relative to those of industrialised Western cultures) is explored with regard to indigenous conceptions of human agency over resource abundance, and the relevance this has for management and conservation. I also speculate about recent transformations of rural Melanesian ontological frameworks through Western/scientific influences, and the associated differences in knowledge systems between young and old members of society, again with respect to the implications these have for the work of proponents of resource management and biodiversity conservation in the region.",

As a result, the reporting population for Jobseeker Payment and Special Benefit has changed to include recipients who are current but on zero rate of payment and those who are suspended from payment. The reporting population for ABSTUDY, Austudy, Parenting Payment and Youth Allowance has changed to include those who are suspended from payment.\r\nThe expanded report will replace the standard report after June 2023.\r\n\r\nAdditional data for DSS Expanded Benefit and Payment Recipient Demographics – quarterly data includes:\r\n\r\n• A new contents page to assist users locate the information within the spreadsheet\r\n\r\n• Additional data for the ‘Suspended’ population in the ‘Payment by Rate’ tab to enable users to calculate the old reporting rules.\r\n\r\n• Additional information on the Employment Earning by ‘Income Free Area’ tab.\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom December 2022, Services Australia have implemented a change in the Centrelink payment system to recognise gender other than the sex assigned at birth or during infancy, or as a gender which is not exclusively male or female. \r\nTo protect the privacy of individuals and comply with confidentialisation policy, persons identifying as ‘non-binary’ will initially be grouped with ‘females’ in the period immediately following implementation of this change.\r\nThe Department will monitor the implications of this change and will publish the ‘non-binary’ gender category as soon as privacy and confidentialisation considerations allow.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Government Area has been updated to reflect the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2022 boundaries from June 2023.\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Electorate Division has been updated to reflect the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2021 boundaries from June 2023.\r\n\r\nSA2 has been updated to reflect the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2021 boundaries from June 2023. \r\n\r\nFrom December 2021, the following are included in the report:\r\n\r\n* selected payments by work capacity, by various demographic breakdowns\r\n\r\n* rental type and homeownership\r\n\r\n* Family Tax Benefit recipients and children by payment type\r\n\r\n* Commonwealth Rent Assistance by proportion eligible for the maximum rate\r\n\r\n* an age breakdown for Age Pension recipients\r\n\r\nFor further information, please see the Glossary.\r\n\r\nFrom June 2021, data on the Paid Parental Leave Scheme is included yearly in June releases. This includes both Parental Leave Pay and Dad and Partner Pay, across multiple breakdowns.  Please see Glossary for further information. \r\n\r\nFrom March 2017 the DSS demographic dataset will include top 25 countries of birth.

    "description": "The National Groundwater Information System (NGIS) is a spatial database for GIS specialists that contains a range of groundwater information submitted by States and Territories. The System contains more than 850 000 bore locations with associated lithology logs, bore construction logs and hydrostratigraphy logs. 2D and 3D aquifer geometries are also available for some areas. Jurisdictional groundwater management area boundaries are the most recent addition to the System.  \r\n  \r\nBores, bore log and groundwater management area information from the System can be accessed and visualised using the [Australian Groundwater Explorer](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/groundwater/explorer) , without using desktop GIS software. The Explorer also includes data not contained in the National Groundwater Information System, such as groundwater level and salinity time-series data. Landscape characteristic spatial layers, such as geology, land use and river regions can also be displayed to provide context to the groundwater data. \r\n  \r\nHydrogeologic units within the System have been standardised for national consistency using the [National Aquifer Framework.](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/groundwater/naf/index.shtml)  Version 1.3 uses the NGIS Version 2.3 data model and was released in August 2015.

    "description": "This dataset presents the volunteering rate of the population in small regions of Australia based on the 2016 Census and aggregated following the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The data has been provided by The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).\nThis indicator is the number and proportion of people in the area who have done unpaid voluntary work through an organisation or group in the last 12 months.\nAll indicators were extracted from the ABS Tablebuilder system using the usual residence profile. For usual residence data, the ABS moves people back to where they live, rather than using the location the data were collected (place of enumeration). Usual residence data is preferred for individual level data because it removes the effect of respondents travelling or holidaying.\nFor more information please view the NATSEM Technical Report.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data provided directly from NATSEM.\n\n\nWhere data values are NULL, the data is either unpublished or not applicable mathematically.\n\n\nThe treatment of Not Stated and Overseas Visitor data is to exclude them from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n\nMethodology between the 2016 NATSEM and 2011 OECD data release may have changed, please refer to the technical report for parity status and specific changes.\n\n",

Applied, Approved and Under\nConstruction, and Complete.\n\nSite content is derived from a range of sources\nat various times and as such the content may not be free from errors, omissions\nor defects. Inconsistencies may occur in some data sets. The City of Melbourne\nuses its best endeavours to ensure that the information is reliable.\n\nThe massings in the Sketchup model are\nrepresentational only, sit on a two dimensional planar surface and are not\nintended for analytical or comparative purposes. The massings are derived by\nextruding simplified polygons of an indicative floor plate for the podium (if\nrelevant) and tower. The height data is an approximation of the height of the\nbuilding and does not show the architectural features of the buildings.\n\nUsers can then make an informed decision as to\nwhether the site content is appropriate for their particular purpose and\ninformation needs.\n\nAlthough all due care has been taken to ensure\nthat this data is correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by City of\nMelbourne in its use.\nPreview Image:\n\n\nDownload:\nDownload the Development Activity Model as a .skp file.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2012 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. \n\nExperiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT.\nThis experiment was designed to determine if owner advantage in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, was due to floaters being poorer fighters for their size compared with burrow owners. This was achieved by comparing the fights between owners - prior floaters, with the fights between owners - prior territory owners. In both cases owners won the majority of fights; winning 92.5% of the their fights against prior owners, and 90% of their fights against prior floaters. Therefore prior floaters do not appear to be poorer fighters.",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for fish in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches for these HWS scenarios:Current: habitat suitability for fish under current conditions (i.e. 2014).Current trajectory: habitat suitability for fish under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue. Target trajectory: habitat suitability for fish given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.Results are presented as:Stacked probabilities, i.e. habitat suitability all 13 native fished species added together. These stacked probability values were used in the HWS to provide a fish value score each reach and sub-catchments.Results are also provided for all 22 fish species. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for fish from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.Habitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs), and 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. Further reading: Chee et al.

    "title": "Over-arching record: Water Circulation of Jervis Bay (Jervis Bay Baseline Studies Project 8)",
    "description": "The Jervis Bay Project was set up to undertake baseline studies of the key habitats and species in Jervis Bay on the New South Wales coast, and to develop a monitoring program to assist with long-term management of the bay. It was funded by the Department of Defence who at that time planned to relocate the fleet base of the Royal Australian Navy to Jervis Bay, and although this plan was abandoned mid-way through the study, the study was completed and the final report published in 1994.\n\nA series of 12 projects were proposed, with the 8th, 'Water Circulation of Jervis Bay' being undertaken by the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of this project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nTwo experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay. The first during the summer months when the bay is normally thermally stratified, from 6th December 1988 to 11th January 1989, and the second during winter when thermal stratification is generally much weaker, from 10th July to 30th October 1990. Between these two experiments, moorings were maintained in the bay entrance and on the shelf, from April 1989 to April 1990, in order to investigate exchange processes between the bay and shelf waters. Further, to better understand the partition of energy from the wind through the water column, two deployments were made with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler that gives current time series at 1m depth intervals over most of the water column. A summer deployment of the Doppler profiler was run from December 1990 to January 1991 and a winter deployment was run from July to September 1991. Approximately once per month throughout the three year period, 1989-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within the bay and out across the shelf to provide additional information on the water exchange and circulation.\n\nAvailable to download through this record is a pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project. Also available are the pdfs of the published working papers documenting the research. There are seven subsiduary records that directly relate to this over-arching record (see hierarchical tree): \n06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8 \n84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\n5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\nb146e140-2ae6-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\nc571bb80-2ae7-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\n13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8\n629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Adelaide) with SA2 code (41001).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Adelaide SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

    "description": "This foundational spatial dataset provides the building footprint geometries and contextual attributes that enable all rooftop solar analyses in the Kalgoorlie-Boulder collection, serving as the essential geographic framework linking solar potential to specific locations.\n\nThe dataset integrates Microsoft Bing building footprints with Australian Bureau of Statistics mesh block boundaries, elevation derived from the Elvis – Elevation and Depth (Geoscience Australia) dataset, and 2021 Census dwelling counts, creating a comprehensive spatial reference for approximately 16,000 buildings across 530 mesh blocks. Each footprint includes geometric attributes, statistical geography codes (SA1-SA4, mesh block), topographic classification, elevation, and population context.\n\nThis resource enables users to filter solar datasets by administrative boundaries, analyse potential across different land use categories, relate solar capacity to population density, or develop custom spatial queries joining solar metrics with other urban datasets. It serves as the join key between solar irradiance/potential estimates and real-world building locations.\n\nCritical applications include spatial planning analysis (identifying high-potential zones for solar incentive programs), equity assessment (evaluating renewable energy access across socio-economic areas), and infrastructure planning (relating distributed generation potential to grid connection points). GIS analysts can use mesh block and SA codes to integrate solar data with ABS Census statistics, health data, or other spatially-referenced datasets.\n\nFootprints represent 2013-2018 building stock and may not capture recent construction. Elevation values support topographic context, but solar calculations use flat-roof assumptions. This is the recommended base layer for all spatial analyses using the solar datasets.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

    "description": "A combination of surveys and experiments were used to assess the reproductive patterns of Siphonaria diemenensis in 2 zones on the rocky shore at Griffith Point, San Remo, Victoria. One zone was in the high intertidal (Zone 2) and one was in the low intertidal area on the shore. There were 3 sites in Zone 1 and 2 sites in Zone 2 (see parent record for more details).\n\nThe breeding season of S. diemenensis was between August and May and spawning correlated with the phases of the moon. The numbers of egg masses at each site were recorded from regular searches during the breeding seasons in 1980-81 and 1981-82. The reproduction rates were highly variable between seasons in Zone 1 and less variable in Zone 2. It was suggested that the variation in reproductive rates between the different zones was correlated with changes in food availability. \n\nAn experiment was conducted to determine the reproductive effort of different sized individuals and to examine how responsive reproductive patterns are to changes in environmental conditions. On 18 August 1980, limpets were collected and placed within steel mesh enclosures (10x10cm). The enclosures were assigned to 8 different treatments groups (n=3). Details of the treatments are outlined in the attached resource. Egg masses were collected from the enclosures at regular intervals and at the completion of the experiment on 4 April 1981, 5 limpets were collected per enclosure. The shell length and dry weight was recorded for each limpet.",

Each place is connected to a historical theme that expresses an aspect of cultural life in Sydney – these themes are colour coded throughout the website and on this map. Together these themes provide a layered narrative of the lived experience of Sydney’s Aboriginal people.  While all these places have historical significance, many have changed or disappeared. Others are private buildings or educational facilities that are not suitable to visit. View this map, and to learn more, visit Barani Sydney's Aboriginal history.",

As such, the data in these data tables include events of sexual violence by a non-familial perpetrator.\nUnless expressly stated otherwise, the data used in these data tables count the number of records provided by Ambulance Victoria. \nThis translates to the number of patients (non-unique) who were the subject of an event which involved Ambulance Victoria attendance.\nIn order to maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are displayed as \"≤ 3\" and are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.",

    "description": "The Reef Rescue Marine Monitoring Program (RRMMP) has identified that seagrass meadows along the Great Barrier Reef are in a state of decline. This project will undertake desktop analyses to quantify the exposure of seagrass meadows to flood plumes. Aquaria experiments will measure responses of seagrass to variation in light, nutrients and salinity. This project will also use use True Colour Remote sensing images, to derive flood plume exposure and relate to changes in seagrass abundance and composition.  The results will be synthesised to define thresholds of concern of water quality impacts, with a particular focus on flood plumes, and input into the development of guidelines for the protection of seagrass meadows.\n\nTasks include: \n1. Quantifying the level of exposure of seagrass meadows to changes in water quality associated with flood plumes (using True Colour Remote sensing) in coastal regions of the GBR.\n \n2. Measurement of changes in biological traits (e.g. growth, biomass) of seagrass in relation to water quality  (Light, nutrients, salinity) determined by experimental studies.\n\n3. Experimental testing of indicators of seagrass status adopted in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Monitoring Program (MMP) (e.g. nutrient ratios) in response to changes in water quality. \n\n4. Experimental verification of water quality response models and thresholds, in particular in relation to the MMP.",

    "description": "Taken from the survey report:\n\nConstruction of a suitable runway near Casey is a major objective of the Air Link from Hobart to the Australian Antarctic Territory and the main focus of this season's fieldwork. The 2002/2003 summer season's Air Transport Project identified and started construction of a snow capped 'Blue Ice' runway site known as A6 South, located in the Upper Vanderford Glacier (UVG) region approximately 65 km south east of Casey Station.\n\nThis season a five-member team was assembled to undertake additional investigation work in relation to snow pavement and to finalise the appropriate aeronautical charts needed to operate a runway supporting wheeled aircraft conducting inter-continental flights from Hobart.\n\nThe runway survey work this season had several objectives:\n\n1) undertake further work on A6 South to produce Type A and B aeronautical charts;\n\n2) determine the Runway flow (movement) rates;\n\n3) survey the Taxiway and Apron areas to facilitate their design; and\n\n4) survey the traverse route from Casey to the site to assist in VHF communications between the Runway and Casey station.\n\nAdditional to the Runway survey a number of other tasks were also carried out in\n\nsupport of science programs being undertaken at Casey.\n\nThe tasks outlined in the surveyors brief are varied and numerous and are included to provide the surveyor with a full and appropriate work program. The various tasks are prioritised, usually with one or two major tasks and a number of minor tasks listed to be undertaken if the opportunity arises. This season's Survey Brief has been included in Appendix A with a summary of achievements listed in Appendix B.\n\nThe following report covers the survey fieldwork undertaken by Air Transport Project (ATP) during the 2003/2004 Summer Field Season. Data collected in support of other scientific programs has been included in this report primarily as a record of work undertaken by the mapping program. These data have been supplied to the various scientists for inclusion in their studies.\n\nSpot height and contour data that were a product of this survey are included in shapefiles available from the Related URLs. The spot heights and contours that were a product of this survey have Dataset_id = 278 in the attribute table.\n\nThe spot heights are along the route from Casey to Wilkins aerodrome, in the vicinity of the aerodrome, along the route to Browning Peninsula and from Browning Peninsula to the aerodrome.\n\nThe contours cover Wilkins aerodrome and nearby area.\n\nElevations are in metres above mean sea level.\n\nThe surveyor, Aaron Read, calculated the elevations above mean sea level from elevations above the ellipsoid using the EGM96 geoid model.",

    "title": "Consolidated Exposures – Ultimate Risk Basis – Foreign Claims by Country",
    "description": "    \r\n\r\nIn March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs)\r\nbegan reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures\r\nto APR in _ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures_. This return is the basis of\r\nthe data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\r\nfor its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APR ceased\r\nthe RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the _[BIS Guide on\r\nInternational Financial Statistics\r\n[PDF]](http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf)_ (see Part II\r\nInternational banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other\r\ncountries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: _locational_ data, which are used to gauge the\r\nrole of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international\r\ncapital flows; and _consolidated_ data, which can be used to monitor the\r\ncountry risk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are\r\nreported in this statistical table.\r\n\r\nData are shown for a range of countries and regions. Similar data for a\r\nselected group of countries are also available in statistical table B13.2.\r\n\r\nCountry and regional groupings are based on the classification used in the\r\nIBS.\r\n\r\nData presented in this statistical table are ultimate risk claims. Ultimate\r\nrisk claims cover claims on an immediate counterparty location basis that have\r\nbeen adjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the\r\nlocation of the ultimate counterparty/risk. Data on immediate risk claims\r\n(expressed by the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis) are available\r\nin complementary statistical tables B13.1 and B13.1.2.\r\n\r\nForeign claims represent international claims plus foreign officesa local\r\nclaims on residents in both local and foreign currencies. International claims\r\nrepresent cross-border claims in all currencies and foreign officesa local\r\nclaims in non-local currencies (which would include, for example, USD claims\r\non New Zealand residents by the New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian-owned\r\nbank). Local currency claims on local residents by the foreign offices of\r\nreporting entities (for example, the New Zealand dollars (NZD) claims on New\r\nZealand residents by the New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian-owned bank).\r\n\r\nThis statistical table contains seven data worksheets. Six present data for\r\ncountries within each specified region, while the aSummarya worksheet shows\r\ntotal foreign claims of the globally consolidated operations of Australian-\r\nowned banks for each region, international organisations and unallocated. In\r\neach of these worksheets, the data in the last column measures total foreign\r\nclaims for the region. Total foreign claims for each country add to total\r\nforeign claims for the region. However, in some quarters, this cannot be\r\ndirectly verified because data for individual countries and regions have blank\r\nentries in order to avoid disclosing confidential bank exposures.\r\n\r\nIn the aSummarya worksheet, the positions by region and international\r\norganisation, and unallocated are summed to produce a aTotala figure that\r\nrepresents reporting entitiesa total international exposures.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The data set contains airborne pollen concentrations (grains per cubic meter) from samples taken at Acton site, Canberra, Australia (-35.27, 149.12) between July 2016 and June 2020. Each data row has two concentrations: one for grass (Poaceae) and one for all other pollens. For comparison with other data sets and between pollen seasons the data weeks start at July 1 each calendar year. Extra days at the end of the pollen year are included in week 52. Each data row has a collection period start date, the number of days within the collection period (7-9), and the number of days on which pollen was collected and summed (0-9). Concentrations represent only the number of days collected and not always the full collection period, as indicated.\nAirborne pollen samples were collected using a volumetric continuous flow impaction sampler (Burkard Manufacturing, UK), stained with fuchsin and counted by light microscopy according to best practice described in the Australian Airborne Pollen and Spore Monitoring Network Interim Standard and Protocols (Version 2, 14 September 2018).\nData may be used for modelling and forecasting airborne grass, other, total pollen levels. Other uses include analysis of the effect of pollen levels on asthma and allergy presentations, or in inference of grass and other vegetation growth patterns. Data may also be used for evaluation of medium or long-term trends over time or comparison withpollen exposure levels between spatial distant locations.\nMetadata about this and other AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network monitoring sites is provided on the National Environmental Monitoring Site Register. Information about other pollen and spores monitored can be found by the AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network Species Classification on the ARDC Research Vocabularies site.\nAURIN has added latitude, longitude and spatialised geometry columns for each row based on the coordinates of the pollen samples. Periods over which no data is available are marked as null.",

    "description": "This experiment was conducted to determine if an established Botryllus schlosseri colony affected the recruitment of sessile invertebrates. Small perspex plates that had been in the field for 8 weeks and then in a laboratory water table were used to test  this hypothesis. Treatment plates were scraped of all organisms expect for the B. schlosseri colonies. Control and 'mimic' plates were scraped of all organisms. Mimic B. schlosseri were made from silicone and used to determine if the effects were due to the physical structure of the organism or biological attributes (e.g. post-settlement overgrowth or chemical defence mechanisms). Plates were suspended from Workshops Jetty, Williamstown for 10 days (2nd March to 12th March 2004) before being collected. At the conclusion of the experiment all species found on the plates were counted and identified.",

A similar service with a ‘multiCRS’ suffix is available which can support GDA2020, GDA94 and WGS 84 ≈ GDA2020 environments.In due course, and allowing time for user feedback and testing, it is intended that the original service name will adopt the new 'multiCRS' functionality.\nMetadata Portal Metadata Information\n\n\nContent TitleNSW Features of Interest Category (Formerly Points of Interest)Content TypeHosted Feature LayerDescriptionThe Features of Interest Category consists of features whose primary characteristic are of a cultural (man-made) origin, but generally not including transportation related features.  These features do not fit within one of the ten foundation spatial data themes and are therefore classified as a category. They have historically been captured by Spatial Services as part of the NSW digital topographic mapping program and therefore warrant inclusion.  The Features of Interest theme also defines the location of facilities such as Police Stations, Ambulance Stations and Hospitals which is crucial information for the citizens of NSW. The Features of Interest Category is primarily used for planning, developmental activities, navigation and resource monitoring by emergency services, the Defence Forces, environmental resource managers and engineers. This information is also commonly used by bushwalkers, canoeists, anglers and fossickers to establish a detailed picture of the local environment. The clear definition of these features is vital for emergency services in response situations.  Data included in the Features of Interest Category:Utility Water Supply Canal Tank Area Tank Point Place Point Building Complex Point Electricity Transmission Line General Cultural Point General Cultural Area General Cultural Line General Cultural Point General Line Feature General Recreation Point Place Area Metadata Initial Publication Date27/03/2024Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:3857WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "The datafile, published by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) contains the composition and abundance of airborne pollen in the suburb of Campbelltown (University of Western Sydney), Sydney, NSW, Australia. The data was collected for the period between January 1993 to December 1995 as a study presented by Bass D and Morgan G entitled “A three year (1993–1995) calendar of pollen and Alternaria mould in the atmosphere of south western Sydney.” Grana 1997; 36: 293-300. This forms part of a study of the Australian Aerobiology working group (Haberle, Bowman, Newnham, Johnston, Beggs, Buters, Campbell, Erbas, Godwin, Green, Heute, Jaggard, Medek, Murray, Newbiggin, Thibaudon, Vicendese, Williamson, Davies “The macroecology of airborne pollen in Australian and New Zealand urban areas” ).\nAirborne pollen counts were derived from deployment of a seven-day Hirst-type volumetric pollen and spore trap located on a rooftops at 10m above the ground. The Burkard 7 Day Volumetric Spore Trap sampler (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK) uses a range of adhesive surface compound (50% saturated Dow Corning high vacuum grease in solvent) on MelinexTM tape (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd.). The seven-day tapes were then cut into 24-hr segments and mounted on glass slides with a stain of 2% Saffranin O in glycerol jelly. Analysis of each 24-hr period is conducted by counting three transects at 400 magnification. The data is summed to provide an average weekly pollen count in grains per cubic meter..\nFor more information please visit the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data, acquired via the ACEAS Data Portal with permission from TERN.\n\n\nThis dataset allows you to filter the data by the date of collection.\n\n",

    "description": "This interactive dashboard contains a map and graphs to indicate the loss of mature trees in the urban area of the ACT, from 2015 to 2020.  The map uses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data\ncaptured in 2015 and 2020 to plot the trajectory of mature tree loss over time. The associated graphs\nand diagrams indicate mature tree loss by suburb, land use and suburb age. These metrics can be used to assess the loss of mature trees across the landscape as required under the Loss of Mature Native Trees Action Plan 2021.\n\nCaveats for the LiDAR-derived data used in this dashboard:\n1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees.\n2. The variable window filter algorithm used in this project was optimised to delineate larger, native trees. As such, smaller (younger) trees and exotics such as Pinus radiata may be under-segmented.\n3. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights), there may still be errors present.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset contains all the input files and scripts to run the regional scale analytic element model for the Gloucester subregion as described in product 2.6.2, Groundwater numerical modelling for the Gloucester subregion (Peeters et al. 2016), as well as a single instance of the model output files.\n\n\n\nThis model is run 10.000 times to provide inputs for the uncertainty analysis and the alluvial modflow models for the Avon and Karuah, also described in product 2.6.2 (Peeters et al. 2016).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPeeters L, Dawes W, Rachakonda P, Pagendam D, Singh R, Pickett T, Frery E, Marvanek S, and McVicar T (2016) Groundwater numerical modelling for the Gloucester subregion. Product 2.6.2 for the Gloucester subregion from the Northern Sydney Basin Bioregional Assessment. Department of the Environment, Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and Geoscience Australia, Australia. http://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/product/NSB/GLO/2.6.2.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe dataset has all files and scripts necessary to execute the 10.000 runs on the linux platform of the CSIRO High Performance Cluster computers. Powerpoint file 'GLO_AEM_flowchart.pptx' describes the workflow of how all the files link together and the order in which they need to be executed.\n\n\n\nThe folder 'inputs' has all the input files for the model. Part of these inputs are stochastic components of the model, which are generated through python script 'inputs/GLO_AEM_stochastic_generator.py'. This script produces the 1000 stochastic realisations of number and position of coal seams (inputs/coalseams), the major faults (inputs/majorfaults), the subseismic faults (inputs/subseismicfaults) and a single realisation of the CSG well file (GLO_AEM_wellfile.csv), which has the coordinates, coal seams intercepted and pumping schedule of the 110 CSG wells in the model. The script takes three input files: 'inputs/GLO_AEM_wellfile_xy.csv', 'inputs/GLO_AEM_MajorFaults.csv','inputs/GLO_AEM_subseismicfaultdomain.csv'. \n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_MajorFaults.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_subseismicfaultdomain.csv' control the geometry and position of the faults and is derived from the geological model described in product 2.1 (Frery et al 2016), dataset GLO RMS Model Depth Structure Eroded v01. File 'inputs/GLO_AEM_wellfile_xy.csv' has the coordinates of the 110 CSG wells, randomly distributed within the AGL stage 1 area (dataset AGL Gloucester Gas Project AECOM report), taking into account the existing and planned mines (dataset Gloucester digitised coal mine boundaries) and the NSW exclusion zones (dataset New South Wales 2 kilometers Residential exclusion zones).\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_BasinBoundary.csv' are the lateral boundaries of the model and are derived from the geological map (dataset Geological Maps Combined for NSW).\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_gwreceptors.csv' are the locations of the groundwater receptors in the weathered zone (from dataset GLO Receptors 20150828).\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_footprint_baseline.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_footprint_crdp.csv' are the footprints of the mine pits, from dataset 'Gloucester digitised coal mine boundaries'\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_waterproduction_baseline.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_mine_waterproduction_crdp.csv' are the time series of pumping rates assigned to the mine footprints. These are sourced from following reports: Duralie: HydroSimulations (2014) - Stratford: Heritage Computing (2012) - Rocky Hill: Australasian Groundwater and Environmental Consultants Pty Ltd (2013)\n\n\n\n'inputs/GLO_AEM_targets.csv' and 'inputs/GLO_AEM_interpol_targets.csv' are the coordinates of the output locations in the weathered zone for, respectively, communication with the alluvial groundwater models and interpolation of exceedance probability grids. These coordinates are chosen and generated by the modelling team.\n\n\n\nThe above mentioned files are the input files for the main python script, 'GLO_AEM.py', which uses the ttim package (in directory 'ttim', Bakker, 2015) to generate following files:\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_CSG_waterproduction_0000.csv': simulated water production rate CSG wells for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwreceptors_baseline_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at groundwater receptors under baseline for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwreceptors_crdp_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at groundwater receptors under CRDP for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwtargets_baseline_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at target locations for communication with alluvial modflow models under baseline for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_gwtargets_crdp_0000.csv': simulated time series of drawdown at target locations for communication with alluvial modflow models under CRDP for simulation 0000\n\n\n\nThe python script reads parameter combination from 'GLO_DoE_Parameters.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01', the 10.000 parameter combinations for the design of experiment to train the emulators.\n\n\n\nBatch file 'GLO_AEM.q' manages running all 10.000 parameter combinations on the linux platform of the CSIRO High Performance Cluster computers.\n\n\n\nPython script 'GLO_AEM_final_spatial_interpolation.py' is almost identical to 'GLO_AEM.py', but reads 200 randomly sampled parameter combinations of the posterior parameter combinations in file 'GLO_AEM_Posterior_interpol.csv' from dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. It produces following output files:\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_interpol_baseline_0000.csv': simulated drawdown at interpolation locations for exceedance probability grids under baseline for simulation 0000\n\n-'outputs/GLO_AEM_h_interpol_crdp_0000.csv': simulated drawdown at interpolation locations for exceedance probability grids under CRDP for simulation 0000\n\n\n\nBatch file 'GLO_AEM_final_spatial_interpolation.q' manages running all 10.000 parameter combinations on the linux platform of the CSIRO High Performance Cluster computers.\n\n\n\nThis dataset only contains a single set of model outputs. During the modelling for the Bioregional Assessments, 10.000 of the output files were generated. \n\nThe drawdown time series at the receptors are postprocessed with script 'GLO_AEM_postprocessing.py' (using batch file 'GLO_AEM_postprocessing.q') to generate maximum drawdown (dmax) and time to maximum drawdown (tmax) in file 'GLO_AEM_10kruns.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. \n\nPython script 'GLO_AEM_postprocessing_Qcsg.py' is used to generate the maximum CSG water production rate in file 'GLO_Qcsg_DoE.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. \n\nPython script 'GLO_AEM_interpol_postprocessing.py' is used to generate exceedance probabilities of dmax and tmax in file 'GLO_AEM_interpol_excprob.csv' in dataset 'GLO aem dmax v01'. \n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFrery E, Rohead-O'Brien H, Wilkes P, McVicar T, Van Niel T, Li L, Barron O, Rachakonda P, Zhang Y, Dawes W, Marvanek S, Buettikofer H, and Gresham M (2016) Observations analysis and statistical analysis and interpolation for the Gloucester subregion.

The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nHousehold projections show the number of households that would form if demographic trends continue and if assumptions about living arrangements are realised over the projection period. A household is two or more people who share a dwelling (house, apartment, townhouse, caravan, etc.) and share food and cooking facilities, and other essentials. Household projections show the future number and type of households living in private dwellings. Private dwellings are self-contained accommodation such as houses, apartments, mobile homes or other substantial structures. It does not include accommodation such as boarding houses, nursing homes or prisons.\nThe household projections also include the implied dwelling demand for those households.  This is the likely number of private dwellings needed to accommodate future population-driven demand.\nFor more information please read the Household Projections User Guide.Please note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nHousehold and dwelling numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. They should not be taken to be accurate to that level of detail.\n\n",
