    "description": "Overview  \r\n The productivity and cost of labour have considerable impacts on farm profitability, especially in the labour intensive horticulture industry. \r\n\r\n In this study, commissioned by the World Bank, we compared the labour productivity of seasonal workers employed under the Australian Government's Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) and working holiday makers, and the implications for farm profitability - using a survey, wages data and interviews with employers participating in the SWP. It builds on a previous ABARES study, by including analysis of the non-wage labour costs and factors that may influence growers' decision-making about labour choices. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n\r\n\r\n• The productivity of seasonal workers was higher than that of working holiday makers for the farm businesses in the study. Seasonal workers were 20 per cent more productive than working holiday makers for fruit picking tasks. Seasonal workers who returned to the farm had higher average productivity as they required minimal induction and training in subsequent seasons. \r\n• The non-wage labour cost related to seasonal workers was 2.3 times higher per hour worked than for working holiday makers, and was strongly influenced by requirements under the SWP such as recruitment, administration processes and training. However, the direct monetary benefits of hiring seasonal workers is likely to at least cover the higher non-wage labour costs and hence deliver a profitability gain. \r\n• This study found that in addition to the direct monetary benefits associated with different labour sources, growers recognised the reliability of seasonal workers as beneficial and a key risk management strategy during labour intensive harvest periods. Working holiday makers provide for greater labour flexibility at short notice. It was common for growers to employ seasonal workers and working holiday makers in a complementary fashion where seasonal workers formed the core of the workforce and working holiday makers were employed casually as needed. \r\n• The study suggests the relatively higher productivity and other benefits of accessing seasonal workers warrant further promotion of the SWP in the Australian horticulture industry. It also suggests that further streamlining the recruitment process and other SWP requirements for approved employers could increase the attractiveness for farmers to participate in the program. \r\n",

Profile data were collected using LISST (particle size distributions), CTD (backscatter, temperature and salinity), Hydroscat, Hydrorad (light profiles, extinction coefficients , and scattering properties).

    "description": "The digital ‘1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia’ comprises three layers: the primary 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology lines , and the 1:100 000 State linear structure layer. The product covers approximately 30% of Western Australia, with a focus on areas of exposed Archean and Proterozoic bedrock. The linear structure layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic bedrock structures. This compilation is based on Geological Survey of Western Australia’s (GSWA) published Geological Information Series (GIS) and Geological Exploration Packages (GEP) for which digital 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 interpreted bedrock geology is available. The data packages included are: Kimberley 2017, Tanami–Arunta 2016, West Musgrave 2017, East Albany–Fraser Orogen 2014 (1:250 000 pre-Mesozoic), West Capricorn 2016, East Yilgarn 2017, South Yilgarn 2016, Murchison 2017, and Pilbara 2014. Geological interpretation in these packages is based on extensive fieldwork and interpretation of geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and previously published and unpublished geological mapping. With the exception of minor topological corrections, the spatial integrity of the source packages is maintained. For adjacent but separately compiled packages, seamless interpretation along the edges of project areas has not been executed in order to preserve the spatial integrity of the source information. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the lithostratigraphic units in the polygon and line layers are based on weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships, and include more recent geochronology. The source package of each feature is captured as an additional attribute field. Individual packages are available via the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety’s (DMIRS) eBookshop.",

See metadata record VICMAP_ADDRESS (Vicmap Address) ANZVI0803002578\n\nVicmap Address is Victoria's authoritative geocoded database of property address points.  The data includes predominately, but not exclusively, locational property address identifiers assigned by Local Government, considered to be the primary creator and custodian of property address.  If accessible, other 'real life' property addresses created and used by the community, but not recognized by Local Government including retirement villages, assisted care facilities, industrial and public housing estates etc. are included. The 2011/2012 audit against Local Government addressing revealed a 97.41% match rate, increased from 92.43% in 2008/2009 following the 2009 Address Completion Initiative. Key validation fields are 'source' and 'source_verified', respectively indicating the address source and date last validated against that source. The minimum address attributes required for a property address to be included in Vicmap Address are road name and locality. However, the principal address details include the unit/house number(s), road name (including any type or suffix) and locality (town/suburb/rural district). Vicmap Address is jointly maintained with Vicmap Property (VMPROP), with every address relating to a VMPROP  record, joined through a property_pfi link. Many additional attributes are included, where available, to facilitate use and relevance to the user community.\nN.B. Specifically excluded are non-property related, and electronic address details such as email, post office (PO) boxes, roadside delivery points (RSD's), roadside mail boxes (RMB's) and the like.\nCurrent data model: Version 6.1 (Oct 2016)",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe last of these six experiments consisted of a program of approximately monthly surveys of temperature and salinity distributions from within Jervis Bay, out to the edge of the continental shelf. All temperature, conductivity and pressure measurements were made using a high accuracy Neil Brown \"Smart\" CTD operated in a direct reading mode. The instrument was lowered and raised using a hydraulically operated winch at a speed of less than 1 m/s. Measurements were made on both lowering and raising of the CTD.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available are some pdfs of published working papers documenting this experiment and the results. There are nine subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n6d523cb0-0b78-11dd-89fa-00188b4c0af8\n05818c50-14c2-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\na98cd420-14c3-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\na44b1850-15bd-11dd-9ec7-00188b4c0af8\neb65dd50-14c4-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\n7e03e540-14ba-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\n4919d4f0-1192-11dd-a074-00188b4c0af8\n7f83d0c0-1194-11dd-a074-00188b4c0af8\n0c995f90-15a8-11dd-9ec7-00188b4c0af8",

This includes retention of native vegetation, provision of safe, unimpeded, convenient and ongoing wildlife movement, and rehabilitation, including through environmental offset delivery. Delivery of the higher order ecological corridor network, together with retention of native vegetation  elsewhere in the landscape will contribute to the avoidance of the creation of fragmented and isolated patches of native vegetation.",

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include rocky reef, sand, hard sand and seagrass. The data was collected from November 2003 to October 2004 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The use of underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data, side scan sonar and a Differential GPS unit allowed for the extensive area to be surveyed. The dataset is intended to be used to fulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995.",

By providing a ‘one-stop shop’ for administrative data, it allows you to research the classification of IP rights, linkages between Australian and international IP rights, and the history of IP transfers and exchanges across time.\r\n\r\nIPGOD covers each of the four types of IP rights administered by IP Australia (patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder’s rights) and captures the application process and its results. This includes the type of IP right applied for, key dates and events, and the names of applicants, their agents and other associated parties. It also contains additional information, such as grouped/harmonised names for parties, and their Australian Business Numbers (ABNs) where available.\r\n\r\nIPGOD was first released in 2014 and is updated annually.",

    "description": "Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. \n\nExperiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. This experiment was designed to determine if owner advantage in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi is related to motivation. This was designed on the premise that at low tide owners are thought of as being more motivated than floaters in contests because they have invested in the territory. It was thought that as the tide comes in, the motivational asymmetry is likely to be reduced as both are increasingly motivated to win the contest and the territory. \n\nThe results indicate that as the tide came in owners, not floaters, were more likely to win contests, and size difference also had a significant effect on who won. The result is interesting because it is the first direct test of the role of motivation in contests, and it is a direct contradiction to established theory.",

The master dataset is currently displaying 2016 figures. Small schools, Schools for Specific Purposes (SSPs) and Senior Secondary schools do not have their ICSEA values published by The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA).\n\n\nFollowing the introduction of part-time study in secondary schools in 1993, student enrolments are generally reported in full-time equivalent units (FTE). The FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.\n\n\nNorfolk Island Central School (NICS) is not a NSW government school. NICS is operated by the Australian government. The NSW Department of Education provides school education services under an agreement with the Australian government.\n\n\nSource: Statistics and Analysis Unit.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months from January 2020 to June 2021 and includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. It is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has been reduced by 5.517MW.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are overweight. Uncontrolled high blood pressure (measured high blood pressure) is defined as including any of the following; measured systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more, or; diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more, and; irrespective of the use of blood pressure medication.                         As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset shows a raster spatial model of the distribution and relative density of dugongs (Dugong dugong) in the Torres Strait region based on an aggregate of 24 years (1987 - 2011) of systematic aerial surveys. \n\nAerial surveys were conducted using the strip transect method described by Marsh and Sinclair (1989). The survey region was divided into blocks containing systematic transects of varying length, which were typically perpendicular to the coast across the depth gradient. Tandem teams with two observers on each side of the aircraft independently recorded sightings of dugongs, including information on group size and calf numbers. Transects were 200 m wide at the water¿s surface on either side of the aircraft. \n\nThe spatial data from all the aerial surveys in the region (1987, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2005, 2006, and 2011) were corrected for differences in sampling intensity and area sampled between surveys. The corrected data was then interpolated using universal kridging over the spatial extent of the aerial surveys.\n\nThe modelled abundance and distribution show the relative density of dugongs (areas where there are more or less dugongs) and NOT the absolute dugong density as corrections for perception bias (animals that are available to, but missed by, observers) and availability bias (animals that are unavailable to observers because of water turbidity) can only be applied at the spatial scale of entire surveys (thousands of square kilometres), making them inappropriate for the spatial scale for this dataset. Nonetheless, the relative densities among regions should be approximately comparable (H. Marsh, personal communication).\n\nPlanning units were classified as low (1), medium (2), high (3) and very high (4) dugong density on the basis of the relative density of dugongs estimated from the models and a frequency analysis. Low density areas: 0 dugongs per square km; medium density areas 0.0015 - 0.25 dugongs dugongs per square km; high density areas 0.25 - 0.5 dugongs per square km; very high density areas > 0.5 dugongs per square km.\n\nThe spatial model is 134x118 pixels with a pixel size of 2kmx2km and a spatial reference of WGS84 UTM Zone 54S. The original dataset is stored in ESRI GRID format (60 KB), which was converted to a GeoTiff for use in the e-Atlas (26 kB).

    "description": "Widespread use of radio-active tracer elements in medicine, and the increased interest in the search for radio-active minerals, have led to the development of a variety of instruments for the detection of ionising radiations, and their general use by scientists who may have had no training in physics or electronics. While these instruments present a great diversity in appearance, the functioning depends on general principles which apply to all such equipment. The aim of these notes is to present these general principles in a simple form. For details of design, which are often highly complex, and require great skill and experience, reference should be made to the works listed in the bibliography.",

    "description": "Vegetation of the Wyong LGA, 1999. Broadly mapped the vegetation of this area based largely on aerial photographic interpretation and linked broad structural and floristic differences in vegetation to major geology\ntypes.and utilised a geological coding system to describe the vegetation. The coding system over-simplifies the floristic patterns present, but is generally representative of major trends. The resultant mapping is broad in nature, and masks structural and floristic variation at the fine scale.\nForty-nine (49) vegetation communities are presented by Payne and Duncan (1999), ranging from several types of rainforest, through wet and dry sclerophyll forests, woodlands, heaths and scrub, to swamps, wetlands and mangroves.\nSee Bell (2002) for a brief description, and a table of vegetation units used in this mapping.\nVIS_ID 739\nMap footprint supplied only.

The Plan was developed from the Lake\nMacquarie Flood Study (Part 1 - January 1998 and Part 2 - April 1998) and the Lake\nMacquarie Floodplain Management Study (August 2000).\n\nThe Lake Macquarie Flood Study determined design flood levels for the 1%, 2% and 5% AEP\nfloods and an Extreme flood event. It examined the still water level and also the effect of wave\nrunup along the foreshore.\nThe design events represent floods which have a certain probability of occurrence. The\n“1% AEP” or “1 in 100\" flood has a 1 in 100 chance of being equalled or exceeded in any year.\nOn a LONG TERM average it will happen once in every 100 years, but it is wrong to think it\ncan only happen once in a century. Because floods are random events there is still a 1 in 100\nchance of such a flood occurring next year no matter what happens this year.",

    "description": "The Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions dataset is maintained for the purpose of reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries. This 2014 version marks the change in NSW from  Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas which will now be used for NRM regions in NSW. The 2012 version updated and formalised the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset.\n\nWhilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\n\nSince 2006, NRM regions have been important in the delivery of Australian Government funding initiatives including Caring for our Country, the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Landcare Program, the Environmental Stewardship Program and the Working on Country Indigenous land and sea ranger program. \nIn total, this dataset represents 60 regions as set out below. They comprise 55 mainland regions administered by 54 NRM regional bodies (one region in QLD is jointly administered by two adjacent regional bodies) and seven islands (five administered by the Australian Government as external territories, and two administered by nearby mainland NRM regional bodies).\n \nQueensland\n1.\tBorder Rivers Maranoa-Balonne\n2.\tBurdekin\n3.\tBurnett Mary\n4.\tCape York\n5.\tCondamine\n6.\tDesert Channels\n7.\tFitzroy\n8.\tMackay Whitsunday\n9.\tNorthern Gulf\n10.\tSouth East Queensland\n11.\tSouth West Queensland\n12.\tSouthern Gulf\n13.\tTorres Strait\n14.\tWet Tropics \n15.\tCooperative Management Area (administered jointly by Cape York and Northern Gulf)\n\nNSW\n1.\tCentral Tablelands\n2.\tCentral West\n3.\tGreater Sydney\n4.\tHunter\n5.\tMurray\n6.\tNorth Coast (Including Lord Howe Island)\n7.\tNorth West NSW\n8.\tNorthern Tablelands\n9.\tRiverina\n10.\tSouth East NSW\n11.\tWestern\n\nACT\n1.\tACT\n\nVictoria\n1.\tCorangamite\n2.\tEast Gippsland\n3.\tGlenelg Hopkins\n4.\tGoulburn Broken\n5.\tMallee\n6.\tNorth Central\n7.\tNorth East\n8.\tPort Phillip and Western Port\n9.\tWest Gippsland\n10.\tWimmera\n\nTAS\n1.\tNorth\n2.\tNorth West\n3.\tSouth\n4.\tMacquarie Islands (administered by NRM South)\n\nSouth Australia\n1.\tAdelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges\n2.\tAlinytjara Wilurara\n3.\tEyre Peninsula\n4.\tKangaroo Island\n5.\tNorthern and Yorke\n6.\tSouth Australian Arid Lands\n7.\tSouth Australian Murray Darling Basin\n8.\tSouth East\n\nWA\n1.\tAvon\n2.\tNorthern Agricultural\n3.\tPerth\n4.\tRangelands\n5.\tSouth Coast\n6.\tSouth West\n\n\nNorthern Territory\n1.\tNorthern Territory\n\n\nExternal Territories (administered by the Australian Government)\n1.\tAshmore and Cartier Islands\n2.\tChristmas Island\n3.\tCocos Keeling Islands\n4.\tHeard and McDonald Islands\n5.\tNorfolk IslandCC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2014",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the south central section of Jervis Bay between 6/12/88 and 11/01/89. This 'Red' mooring (35.0883 S, 150.7333 E) held four S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 14.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.   \n\nThe final dataset provides the depth averaged current component data in 10 minute samples at this site. Eastern and northern current components are provided.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Typically, these tests are carried out after the receiver package is installed, but time does not always allow for proper characterisation. Receivers for consideration include UWL, MARS and 13MM packages. In addition to cross-referencing C007 for flux calibration via pointing, we aim to conduct gain-elevation and system temperature experiments using the Moon, to ensure users of the Parkes Observatory have the most accurate information available for calibration purposes.",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during winter were very favourable, and crops are generally in very good condition at the beginning of spring. \r\n• In parts of New South Wales and far southern Western Australia crops were waterlogged by very high winter rainfall, which is expected to constrain yields in these regions. \r\n• In its latest three-month rainfall outlook (September to November 2016), issued on 25 August 2016, the Bureau of Meteorology forecast spring rainfall to be around average in most cropping regions in Australia. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 16 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 46.1 million tonnes, driven by significant increases in forecast production in Western Australia and Victoria. \r\n• Wheat production is forecast to increase by 16 per cent in 2016-17 to 28.1 million tonnes, barley production by 11 per cent to 9.5 million tonnes and canola production by 23 per cent to around 3.6 million tonnes. Wheat and barley production are both forecast to be the second highest on record and canola production to be the third highest. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Planting conditions for dryland crops are expected to be favourable, and supplies of irrigation water for irrigated crops are expected to be higher than in 2015-16. \r\n• Forecast increases in area planted to rice and cotton in 2016-17 are expected to more than offset a forecast fall in area planted to grain sorghum. \r\n• Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 28 per cent to around 4.8 million tonnes. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who have a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally for all births, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who had a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally, divided by the number of females who gave birth vaginally, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2013-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nBirths included are vaginal births, including non-instrumental and instrumental births.\n\n\nBirths excluded are caesarean sections.\n\n\nThird-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in second-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal sphincter, rectrovaginal septum, and sphincter not otherwise specified. Excludes laceration involving the anal or rectal mucosa. A fourth-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in third-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal mucosa and rectal mucosa.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nThese data are derived from returns submitted to the Australian Prudential\nRegulation Authority (APRA) by banks authorised under the _Banking ActA\n1959_. APR assumed responsibility for the supervision and regulation of banks\non 1 July 1998. Data prior to that date were submitted to the RBA.\n\nPrior to March 2002, banks reported to APR on the _Capital Adequacy Return_.\nFrom that date, banks report quarterly on _ARF 110.0: Capital Adequacy_.\nFollowing the introduction of a new capital framework (Basel II) on 1 January\n2008, the data from March 2008 contain significant breaks. For details of the\nBasel II framework, refer to APR prudential standards APS 110aAPS 116, APS\n120 and APS 150. For detailed definitions of the capital components listed\nbelow, refer to APS 111.\n\naConsolidated groupa, for a locally incorporated bank, refers to the global\noperations of the bank and its subsidiaries, excluding those involved in\ninsurance, funds management/trustee and non-financial business.\n\nThis table excludes data of foreign banks authorised to operate in Australia\nas branches.\n\nMeasures of capital are net of deductions such as future income tax benefits,\nintangible assets, investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries, holdings of\nother banksa capital instruments and other assets that are not eligible for\ninclusion in capital.\n\nThe breaks in Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital in March 2008 are largely due to\nchanges in the items that banks are required to deduct from capital. Under\nBasel II, there are a number of new deductions from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital,\nand amounts that were previously deducted from the capital base are instead\ngenerally deducted half from Tier 1 capital and half from Tier 2 capital.\n\naTier 1a capital consists of aShare capitala and other Tier 1 capital items.\n\naShare capitala comprises the paid-up value of ordinary shares and non-\ninnovative Tier 1 capital instruments such as irredeemable preference shares\non which dividends are non-cumulative.\n\nOther Tier 1 capital includes retained earnings, certain reserves and\ninnovative Tier 1 capital instruments up to certain limits.\n\naTier 2a capital consists of aUpper Tier 2a capital and lower Tier 2 capital.\n\naUpper Tier 2a capital includes perpetual cumulative preference shares,\nmandatory convertible notes and subordinated debt, excess Tier 1 capital\ninstruments, and revaluation reserves of premises, securities and other\nassets. Under Basel I and the standardised approach to credit risk under Basel\nII, upper Tier 2 capital also includes the eligible amount of provisions for\ncredit losses (up to a maximum of 1.25 per cent of risk-weighted assets).\nBanks using the Basel II internal ratings based approach can include any\nexcess of eligible provisions over the amount of their expected losses in\nupper Tier 2 capital (up to a limit of 0.6 per cent of risk-weighted assets).\n\nLower Tier 2 capital includes limited life redeemable preference shares, term\nsubordinated debt and other similar instruments; it cannot exceed 50 perA\ncent of Tier 1 capital.\n\naTier 2a capital cannot exceed aTier 1a capital.\n\nUnder Basel I, the aTotal capital basea is calculated as the sum of net Tier 1\nand net Tier 2 capital minus additional capital deductions. Under Basel II,\nthe aTotal capital basea is the sum of net Tier 1 and net Tier 2 capital.\n\naRisk-weighted assetsa comprise a acredit riska component and a amarket risk\nand other exposuresa component. Basel II led to significant changes in the\ncalculation of credit risk weights. Under Basel II, banks must also calculate\nan explicit charge for operational risk, which is included in amarket risk and\nother exposuresa from March 2008.\n\naOn-balance sheeta assets represent the risk-weighted gross amounts of banking\nbook assets.\n\naOff-balance sheeta assets represent the risk-weighted credit equivalent\namounts of commitments, derivatives and other business considered to be aoff-\nbalance sheeta prior to the introduction of AIFRS.\n\naTier 1 capital ratioa refers to Tier 1 capital expressed as a proportion of\ntotal risk-weighted assets.\n\naTotal capital base ratioa refers to the capital base as a proportion of total\nrisk-weighted assets.\n\n",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "The initial aims of the engagement were to investigate the structural integrity of the canal embankment (acting as the town’s levee bank) with a view to determining the best options to upgrade the bank so that it could adequately provide flood protection. However, due to the Loss of Life assessment finding that no one would perish should a breach occur at the 1 in 100 year level, the focus of the engagement moved away from investigating “levee upgrade” options to accepting the consequences. Council would move away from a Flood Modification (Prevention) Strategy (i.e., Levee Bank construction) to a type of Response Modification (Consequence Management) Strategy instead. That is, the preparation of this Consequence Management Plan.",

    "description": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, small duration heavy intensity rainfall events associated with thunder  storms have shown that the Griffith Aerodrome and associated infrastructure are exposed to some potentially destructive, and certainly disruptive, flood risk. In order to quantify the flood risk and then to propose measures which may protect the aerodrome and associated facilities  in the  event of a flood, Griffith City Council (GCC) have appointed WMAwater  to carry  out a flood  study. The Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW) is providing financial assistance towards the flood study.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to:\n<ul>\n<li>Define the overland flow flood behaviour within the aerodrome catchment  (refer  to  Figure 1 for the location of the study area). The principle focus is on those buildings that adjoin the aerodrome facility, i.e. hangers and administrative buildings, as well as the runway itself, and</li>\n<li>Preliminary assessment of mitigation measures.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe study seeks to establish suitable hydrologic and hydraulic model tools, demonstrate their capacity to emulate local flood behaviour via calibration/validation (as data allows)  and then  apply these tools to establish the existing flood risk for a range of  design  flood  event  probabilities in conjunction with a range of event durations. Following design flood modelling for  the existing conditions, a damages assessment for the  aerodrome  will  be  carried  out.  The above work will establish the flood liability of the aerodrome under exisiting   conditions.\n\nThe model will then be utilised to test preliminary mitigation measures. Mitigation measures will seek to reduce the degree of inundation of the aerodrome and associated infrastructure and therefore reduce the flood damages associated with an extreme event. Mitigation options could potentially be quite varied however two that spring to mind in this case are detaining flood water upstream of the aerodrome or diverting it prior to its entry into the aerodrome area.\n\nThis report details the investigations, results and findings of the Flood Study. The key elements of which include:\n* a summary of available data;\n* model development;\n* calibration of the hydraulic  model;\n* definition of the design flood behaviour for existing conditions through the analysis and interpretation of model results; and\n* testing limited mitigation options.",

    "description": "This experiment examined the temporal changes in species composition and diversity of a developing epifaunal community on artificial substrata at Portsea. The substrata used were the bare uncaged panels and cage control panels used in the experiment described in the record 'Effects of predation by fishes on the establishment of the epifaunal community at Portsea, Victoria' (File Identifier: fd9aa0f0-e4c2-11dc-9b6b-00188b4c0af8). There were 4 replicate panels that were immersed for 2, 4 or 7 months on rigs under the Portsea Pier and 6 runs of the experiment from October 1975 to November 1977. At the conclusion of each run of the experiment the panels were fixed in 4% formalin-seawater solution. In the laboratory, the number of individuals and percent cover of colonial species on each panel were recorded.\n\nIn general, the 3 most abundant colonists (barnacle Elminius modestus, tubicolous amphipods and the colonial ascidian Diplosoma rayneri) in the first 2 months decreased as the experiments proceeded. In the following months the surfaces were invariably dominated by arborescent bryozoans, particularly Bugula dentata and Tricellaria porteli and encrusting bryozoans, particularly Celleporaria fusca. Once arborescent bryozoans exceeded a height of 15mm they frequently escaped overgrowth by most encrusting species.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Spotted Mackerel model in the Marine Fisheries node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.\nMaps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the five global climate models (GCMs) used for the Marine Fisheries node, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2004.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Transport is aware that the Traffic Volume datasets have been experiencing issues with data quality and sensor availability.\nThere is an initiative underway to rebuild this service, however this is an extensive task, and a timeline for completion has not yet been set.\nTransport will endeavour to provide updates on progress of this initiative when they become available.\nRMS has permanent and temporary roadside collection devices which continuously collect traffic information data. Through the Traffic Volume Counts API, traffic count data from 2006 is available.\nThere are four datasets (tables) that can be queried:\nTraffic Collection Station Reference- This table provides a general description of the traffic collection station e.g. Geospatial coordinates, road name, suburb, postcode, device type, road number, road type including the data quality rating.\nAnnual Average Traffic Count Summary - This table provides the general description of traffic station, traffic direction, date of recording and the quality of data.\nPermanent Hourly Traffic Counts- This table provides hourly traffic count for each permanent station post 2006 at a daily level.\nSample Hourly Traffic Counts - This table provides hourly traffic count for each sample station post 2006 at a daily level.\nThe Traffic Volume Viewer map provides average road traffic volumes for a selection of permanent and sample roadside collection device stations at key locations across NSW.

    "title": "Marine wildlife management in the Northern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area - Spatial models of dugong distribution and relative density of aerial surveys from 1990 - 2013 (NERP TE 1.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset shows a raster spatial model of the distribution and relative density of dugongs (Dugong dugong) in the northern Great Barrier Reef region based on an aggregate of 24 years (1990 - 2013) of systematic aerial surveys. \r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nAerial surveys were conducted using the strip transect method described by Marsh and Sinclair (1989). The survey region was divided into blocks containing systematic transects of varying length, which were typically perpendicular to the coast across the depth gradient. Tandem teams with two observers on each side of the aircraft independently recorded sightings of dugongs, including information on group size and calf numbers. Transects were 200 m wide at the water¿s surface on either side of the aircraft. \r\nThe spatial data from all the aerial surveys in the region (1990, 1995, 2000, 2006, and 2013) were corrected for differences in sampling intensity and area sampled between surveys. For details on sampling intensities and areas, please refer to the reports and publications for each individual survey (list below). The corrected data were then interpolated using universal kriging over the spatial extent of the aerial surveys.\r\nPlanning units were 2km * 2km and were classified as low (1), medium (2), high (3) and very high (4) dugong density on the basis of the relative density of dugongs estimated from the model and a frequency analysis. Low density areas: 0 dugongs per square km; medium density areas 0.0015 - 0.25 dugongs per square km; high density areas 0.25 - 0.5 dugongs per square km; very high density areas > 0.5 dugongs per square km.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nThe modelled abundance and distribution show the relative density of dugongs (areas where there are more or less animals) and NOT the absolute dugong density as corrections for perception bias (animals that are available to, but missed by, observers) and availability bias (animals that are unavailable to observers because of water turbidity) can only be applied at the spatial scale of entire surveys (thousands of square kilometres), making them inappropriate for the spatial scale for this dataset. Nonetheless, the relative densities among regions should be approximately comparable (H. Marsh, personal communication).\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe spatial model is 2481x3509 pixels with a spatial reference of WGS84 UTM Zone 54S. The original dataset is stored in ESRI GRID format (60 KB), which was converted to a GeoTiff for use in the e-Atlas (134 kB).

Using the 20cm multibeam and a new digital filterbank array this survey will create a petabyte digital record of the sky that can be data mined in the future and used to search for relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars, RRATs, and extragalactic radio bursts. The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

    "title": "Banks – Consolidated Group off-balance Sheet Business",
    "description": "These data are derived from returns submitted to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) by banks authorised under the _Banking Act 1959_. APRA assumed responsibility for the supervision and regulation of banks on 1 July 1998. Data prior to that date were submitted to the RBA.\r\n\r\nPrior to March 2002, banks reported quarterly to APRA on the Off-balance Sheet Business Return. From that date until the end of 2007, banks reported quarterly on ARF 112.2: Capital Adequacy – Off-balance Sheet Business. Following the introduction of a new capital framework (Basel II) on 1 January 2008, the data between March 2008 and  March 2011 were reported on either ARF 112.2: Capital Adequacy – Off-balance Sheet Business, ARF 112.2A: Standardised Credit Risk – Off-balance Sheet Exposures, or ARF 118.0: Off-balance Sheet Business, depending on whether the bank had been approved by APRA to use a Basel II advanced approach to credit risk. Following the revocation of Australian Prudential Standard APS150 on 30 June 2011, banks using the advanced approach to credit risk have been required to report data with reference to the Basel II framework. From June 2011, data are reported on ARF 112.2A: Standardised Credit Risk – Off-balance Sheet Exposures, ARF 118.0: Off-balance Sheet Business, or ARF 118.1: Other Off-balance Sheet Exposures, depending on whether the bank has been approved by APRA to use a Basel II advanced approach to credit risk.\r\n\r\n‘Consolidated group’, for a locally incorporated bank, refers to the global operations of the bank and its subsidiaries, excluding those involved in insurance, funds management/trustee and non-financial business. For a foreign bank authorised to operate in Australia as a branch, the data relate to the operations of the branch only.\r\nFigures are as at the last business day of the quarter and refer to the principal amount (face value) of the transaction.\r\n\r\nFrom March 2002, banks are required to report separately activity in the banking and trading books for interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and other derivative contracts. Banking and trading book figures are added to produce the data reported in the table. Before March 2002, exposures were netted across the banking and trading books (except credit derivatives). This has necessitated a break in the series.\r\n\r\n‘Direct credit substitutes’ covers any irrevocable obligations that carry the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit. This includes the issue of guarantees, confirmation of letters of credit, standby letters of credit serving as financial guarantees for loans, securities and any other financial liabilities, and certain bills endorsed under bill endorsement lines. ‘Direct credit substitutes’ does not include credit derivatives, which are shown separately.\r\n\r\n‘Trade- and performance-related items’ covers contingent liabilities arising from trade-related obligations secured against an underlying shipment of goods and any irrevocable obligations to make a payment to a third party if a counterparty fails to perform a contractual non-monetary obligation. This includes documentary letters of credit issued, acceptances on trade bills, shipping guarantees issued, issue of performance bonds, bid bonds, warranties, indemnities, standby letters of credit in relation to a non-monetary obligation of a counterparty under a particular transaction, and any other trade- and performance-related items.\r\n\r\n‘Commitments and other non-market-related items’ includes lending of securities or posting of securities as collateral, assets sold with recourse, forward asset purchases, partly paid shares and securities, placements of forward deposits, underwriting facilities, standby lines of credit, redraw facilities, undrawn credit card facilities, and all other non-market-related off-balance sheet items.\r\n\r\n‘Interest rate contracts – OTC forwards’ covers single currency over-the-counter interest rate forwards including forward rate agreements.\r\n\r\n‘Interest rate contracts – OTC swaps’ covers single currency over-the-counter interest rate swaps.\r\n\r\n‘Interest rate contracts – Other’ covers other single currency over-the-counter and exchange-traded interest rate contracts including interest rate options written and purchased.\r\n\r\n‘Foreign exchange contracts – OTC forwards’ covers over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards including foreign exchange forward contracts involving gold.\r\n\r\n‘Foreign exchange contracts – OTC swaps’ covers over-the-counter foreign exchange swaps including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swap contracts involving gold.\r\n\r\n‘Foreign exchange contracts – Other’ covers other over-the-counter and exchange-traded foreign exchange contracts including other foreign exchange contracts involving gold.\r\n\r\n‘Credit derivatives’ covers all credit derivatives contracts, both where protection is purchased and protection is sold. Banks were required to report credit derivatives exposure to APRA from June 2000 following a change to the Off-balance Sheet Business Return. This has necessitated a break in the series.\r\n\r\n‘Other off-balance sheet business’ covers equity contracts including written and purchased options positions, derivatives based on gold and precious metals, base metals, energy and other commodities, and all other derivative activity.",

Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core and the percentage of carbonate material in each sample. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis dataset supersedes the previous version, HUN_AssetList_Database_v1p2_20150128 GUID: 64ecd565-bb7c-4f21-951e-f35966b91c99 to resolve an issue where unique asset identifiers (AID) were found to have been duplicated within an Asset List Database which had been prepared for another subregion. \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains the spatial and non-spatial (attribute) components of the Hunter subregion Asset List as an .mdb file, which is readable as an MS Access  database or as an ESRI Personal Geodatabase.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. A report on the WAIT process for the Hunter is included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Hunter subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. \n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"AnR_database_HUN_v1p3_20150212.doc\", located in this file.\n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.\n\n\n\nDetailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"AnR_database_HUN_v1p3_20150212.doc\" located in this file.\n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe Asset List Database was developed to identify water dependent assets located within the Hunter subregion.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOn 20 April 2015 the title of this database was changed from \"HUN AssetList v1.3 20150212\".\n\n\n\nThis dataset supersedes the previous version, HUN_AssetList_Database_v1p2_20150128 GUID: 64ecd565-bb7c-4f21-951e-f35966b91c99 to resolve an issue where unique asset identifiers (AID) were found to have been duplicated within an Asset List Database which had been prepared for another subregion. \n\n\n\nThe previous version of the Hunter asset list database (v1.2 as noted above) was updated with the inclusion of data from NSW Department of Primary Industries - Office of Water: HIGH PROBABILITY GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT VEGETATION WITH HIGH ECOLOGICAL VALUE (Hunter-Central Rivers). It superseded the previous database: \"Asset list for Hunter - CURRENT\"; ID: 51b1e021-2958-4cd3-8daa-ba46ece09d1c.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Hunter subregion on 12 February 2015.

The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA4. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA4 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis data and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied. \n\n\n\nCatchment Scale Land Use Management (CLUM) compiled November 2012 (data ranges from 1997 to 2009, scale ranges from 1:25,000 to 1:250,000), The most current catchment scale land use dataset for Australia has been compiled using nationally agreed land use mapping principles and procedures of the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 7. The land use datasets were collected as part of State and Territory mapping programs and the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). The data vary in currency (1997 to 2009) and scale (1:25,000 to 1:250,000).\n\nThe updated dataset is a combined 50m raster for Australia and includes new data for Tasmania, Victoria, parts of southwest Western Australia and the following Queensland natural resource management regions: Wet Tropics, Burdekin, Mackay-Whitsunday, Burnett Mary and Fitzroy. While there is no new data for New South Wales, edge-matching errors have been corrected. \n\nAll contributing polygon datasets were re-gridded and mosaiced to minimise resampling errors. NODATA voids were filled with Australian Bureau of Statistics meshblocks land use attributes with modifications based on 1:250,000 scale topographic data for built up areas published by Geoscience Australia in 2006, land tenure data compiled by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) in 2007, and native and plantation forest data compiled by BRS in 2007.\n\nFull Metadata can be viewed within the dataset.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nBeginning Date: 1997 Ending Date: November 2012 (Data provided as at November 2012 with actual currency of most recent data being 2009 - see Figure 1) Dates of the land use mapping vary across the country depending on when states/catchments/map sheets were mapped. Catchment scale mapping is produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. Mapping from many State and Territory agencies are combined and gridded at 50m.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nAustralian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (2012) Bioregional_Assessment_Programme_Catchment-scale Land Use Management (CLUM).

Recent changes to the COVID-19 public health orders for COVID-19 means it is no longer necessary for laboratories to provide data on negative PCR test results, in line with other diseases. Positive COVID-19 results, through both PCR tests and notified rapid antigen test results, will continue to be reported. NSW Health uses a wide range of surveillance systems, including hospital data, sewage surveillance, and genomic sequencing, to closely monitor COVID-19 and inform its public health response.\nCOVID-19 tests by date and postcode, local health district, and local government area. The dataset is updated weekly on Fridays.\nThe data is for COVID-19 tests and is based on the Local Health District (LHD) and Local Government Area (LGA) of residence provided by the individual at time of testing. A surge in total number of people tested on a particular day may occur as the test results are updated in batches and new laboratories gain testing capacity.\nThe underlying dataset was assessed to measure the risk of identifying an individual and the level of sensitivity of the information gained if it was known that an individual was in the dataset. The dataset was then treated to mitigate these risks, including suppressing and aggregating data. \nOn 16 September 2021, NSW Health implemented a change in the way testing data is reported.\n\nWe will discontinue publication of unit record test data file as the data will only be provided as an aggregated file\nThe aggregated data file will only include negative tests. Positive tests (i.e. cases) will not be included.\n\nPlease note the COVID-19 tests dataset does not include registered positive rapid antigen test (RAT) information.",

    "description": "This study investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of recruitment of epifaunal species at Portsea. Recruitment panels were immersed at depths of 1 - 2.2 metres for 10 months (25/10/1975 - 11/9/1976) and 24 months (16/11/1977 - 14/11/1979) and at depths of 3 - 3.8m for 18 months (11/9/1976 - 18/5/1978). Each panel was divided into four quadrats (9 x 9cm) and the number of larvae recruits in each quadrat was recorded every 2 months using a binocular microscope. The replicate number of quadrats sampled every 2 months varied between 1 and 30 replicates. The mean number of larval recruits per quadrat for each period was calculated for each species at each depth. \n\nAn additional treatment ('complex substratum' treatment) was added to 2 panels for 2-month periods from 13/10/1976 to 12/10/1977 to assess the effects of substratum complexity on the recruitment of epifauna. The complex substratum treatment simulated the physical structure of a barnacle and arborescent bryozoan community. On each panel there was 1 quadrat that was a complex substratum treatment and 1 quadrat that was randomly chosen from the 3 remaining to be analysed as the control. Thus, there were 2 replicate quadrats of each treatment (complex substratum and control) per 2-month period. At the completion of each period all individuals and colonies of each species were counted in each quadrat.\n\nAvailability and abundance of settling larvae varied seasonally and annually. Rates of recruitment of larvae were greatest during spring, summer and autumn. Polychaetes, barnacles, hydroids, tubicolous amphipods and bryozoans recruited in greater abundance and more consistently throughout each year than did ascidians or sponges. A greater diversity of species settled on the complex substratum treatments and the density of settlement of some species was also higher.",

The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as FPM Levee Banks (DOW-034)",

This file describes the quality of the sewage received by providing results of regular sampling.The sample is taken with a flow-weighted auto-sampler. Samples are collected at 7:00 AM each day and relate to the previous 24 hours (e.g. timestamp of 5/1/19 07:00 was sampled between 4/1/19 07:00 and 5/1/19 07:00). Results are in milligrams per litre (mg/L). To calculate an incoming load in raw sewage, match this with wastewater inlet hourly flow for the same time period (as noted in the example).Quality parameters include: Ammonia (Ammonia as N) (mg/L), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) (mg/L), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (mg/L), Nitrate plus Nitrite (mg/L), Nitrogen (Nitrogen (total)) (mg/L).NOTE.

This project will establish the limits of predictability of large-scale variations of the marine environment in Western Australia using POAMA. \n\nPOAMA-1.5 hindcast and realtime data consists of three types output.\n\n1. Hindcasts\nComprehensive set of hind-casts with a 10 member ensemble\n\n2. Forecasts\nThese are realtime forecasts, which are run one per day. Most products involve putting together forecasts for the last 30 days to form an ensemble.\n\n3. Model Climatologies\nModel climatologies in same format as the forecasts and hindcasts. These can be used to creat forecast anomalies and therefore removing model biases. Each set starts on the first of the month. Note, for realtime forecasts starting on different days of the month, one should interpolate the two surrounding climatologies starting on the first of the month.\n\nForecast model output includes monthly means of global fields of upper ocean temperatures, currents, and salinity. Atmospheric fields include global fields of all surface fluxes (momentum, radiation, sensible and latent heat), and winds, temperatures, humidity, clouds, etc. \n\nA subset of daily data, suitable for driving offline mixed layer models and downscaled models, including surface fluxes, surface winds, surface currents and temperature, is also archived.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "The Queensland and Northern Australia Mooring Sub-Facility is part of the Australian National Mooring Network (ANMN). \n\nThis sub-facility consists of array moorings located in the northern tropics along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) for Q-IMOS in the east and in the north western parts of Australia for the WAIMOS nodes. The mooring arrays provide near real time and delayed mode observations from oceanographic moorings comprising physical (temperature, salinity, sea level and currents) and on most moorings, water quality measurements (turbidity, fluorescence, dissolved oxygen). \n\nThe GBR array (extends an earlier long term observing program) is located along the outer Great Barrier Reef in order to monitor the Western Boundary currents of the Coral Sea comprising the poleward East Australian Current (EAC) and the equator-ward Gulf of Papua Current. Four mooring pairs consist of a continental slope mooring in 70 to 300m of water and its partner on the outer continental shelf within the reef matrix in depths of 30 to 70m. The array is designed to detect any changes in circulation, temperature response, mixed layer depth and ocean-shelf exchanges. \n\nWAIMOS observations in the north west of Australia  commenced in June 2010 with the roll out of 4 moorings from Joseph Bonaparte Gulf to the Timor slope. These continental shelf moorings complement a deep water array monitoring the Indonesian Throughflow in the Timor Tough and Ombai Strait operated by the IMOS ABOS facility. In early 2012 two more arrays were added off the Kimberley and Pilbara continental shelf regions (these were discontinued in August 2014). The arrays are looking to monitor boundary currents such as the Holloway and Leeuwin Currents. Cross-shelf exchanges are also observed in these high energy macro-tidal and internal wave dominated shelves. \n\nIn 2013 in partnership with the Darwin Port Corp, the Northern Territory Government a new real time mooring was located in Beagle Gulf. The Palm Passage mooring on the GBR was upgraded to near-real-time in February 2013.",

A considerable amount of information was gained concerning ore deposits in the countries visited and this information should be of assistance in the search for further metal deposits in Australia. At the international Congress useful work was achieved and contact was made with a large number of geologists in various parts of the world. These contacts will facilitate the exchange of information between Australia and foreign geologists. The itinerary followed the attached as an Appendix to this report.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the location of School Disciplinary Absences for Queensland state schools by year and absence type. The data spans the years of 2010-2011.\nState schools are required to report School Disciplinary Absences (SDA) for the school year in their School Annual Report. There are 4 categories of SDA: short suspension (1-5 days), long suspension (6-20 days), suspensions with proposal/recommendation for exclusion and cancellations of enrolment. A student may be suspended or excluded from a state school or schools because of disobedience, misconduct or other conduct that is prejudicial to the good order and management of the school. A student may also be excluded from a state school for contravention of a Behaviour Improvement Condition. Suspension prohibits a student from attending an educational institution for a nominated period of time (from 1-5 days or 6-20 days). Decisions to suspend a student are made by individual state school principals.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - School Disciplinary Absences.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Queensland Department of Education - State and Non State School Listings.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nGeometries modified from State and Non-State School Listings 2012-2018, as provided by QED. For facilities which closed prior to 2012, including Richlands State School [1121], Lindum State School [1682], Wynnum North State school [221], Wynnum Central State School [87] and Hemmant State School [30], data cannot be represented spatially.\n\n\nOn 5 November 2010, state school principals were given the power to exclude students from their school. They may recommend the decision to their supervisor if they believe it is inappropriate for them to make the decision.\n\n\nThe information is displayed in terms of aggregate counts of incidents. These data do not represent the outcomes of any related appeal decisions.\n\n",
