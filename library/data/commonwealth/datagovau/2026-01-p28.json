    "description": "Data describes vegetation extent priorities for each stream reach across the Melbourne Water region. Each reach is classified as either high, medium or low priority. To meet the performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018), high priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2028. To meet the target trajectory scores of the Healthy Waterways Strategy, medium priority reaches need to be revegetated by 2068. Vegetation priority reaches were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates.For the most up-to-date performance objectives, see the co-designed Catchment Programs at: https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about-us/strategies-achievements-and-policies/healthy-waterways-strategy Results are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.This data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs.For further reading on the prioritisation process see:• Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership• Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document, Presentation of revegetation priority reaches for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThe dataset contains shapefiles of the the total combined foot prints of all polygons for each of Baseline, CRDP polygons, and the spatial difference between the two (i.e. ACRD). These shapefiles are used in both the surface water and groundwater modelling to define the spatial extent of the mine workings for the three scenarios.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nFor each of the surface water and groundwater modelling activities, polygons identified as baseline and ACRD were taken from the source data and merged and dissolved to create respective total baseline and ACRD layers.\n\n\n\nCRDP layers were created by merging the baseline and ACRD layers for SW and GW respectivelty. (CRDP = baseline + ACRD).\n\n\n\nCombined SW+GW layers were created by merging and dissolving the respective layers from the SW and GW sets for baseline, ACRD and CRDP respectively.\n\n\n\nRespective shapefiles have been dissolved to get overall baseline, ACRD and CRDP footprint area without double counting due to overlapping polygons.\n\n\n\nNote: The surface water modelling and groundwater modelling use different sets of mine footprints and even when the same mine has been used in both, the extent may be different for SW vs GW modelling.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) HUN Mine GW and SW mine footprint intersections v01.

    "description": "The digital ‘1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia’ comprises three layers: the primary 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology lines , and the 1:100 000 State linear structure layer. The product covers approximately 30% of Western Australia, with a focus on areas of exposed Archean and Proterozoic bedrock. The linear structure layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic bedrock structures. This compilation is based on Geological Survey of Western Australia’s (GSWA) published Geological Information Series (GIS) and Geological Exploration Packages (GEP) for which digital 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 interpreted bedrock geology is available. The data packages included are: Kimberley 2017, Tanami–Arunta 2016, West Musgrave 2017, East Albany–Fraser Orogen 2014 (1:250 000 pre-Mesozoic), West Capricorn 2016, East Yilgarn 2017, South Yilgarn 2016, Murchison 2017, and Pilbara 2014. Geological interpretation in these packages is based on extensive fieldwork and interpretation of geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and previously published and unpublished geological mapping. With the exception of minor topological corrections, the spatial integrity of the source packages is maintained. For adjacent but separately compiled packages, seamless interpretation along the edges of project areas has not been executed in order to preserve the spatial integrity of the source information. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the lithostratigraphic units in the polygon and line layers are based on weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships, and include more recent geochronology. The source package of each feature is captured as an additional attribute field. Individual packages are available via the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety’s (DMIRS) eBookshop.",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R2.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January 26, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, January 31, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth and reported smoking tobacco after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and reported smoking at any time during pregnancy, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and reported smoking after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, divided by the total number of females who gave birth and reported smoking during pregnancy, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nSmoking refers to the use of cigarettes or inhaled tobacco.\n\n\nData excludes mothers whose smoking status was not stated.\n\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is self-reported smoking of tobacco.\n\n\nBecause of differences in definitions and methods used for data collection, care must be taken when comparing across jursidictions.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3 year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "title": "Christmas Island Laser DEM Shiny Colour Drape Images - 2000",
    "description": "In 2000 AAM surveys Pty Ltd. was commisioned by the commonwealth to fly an airborne laser scanning survey of Christmas Island.  Raw data was tiled to shapefiles then converted to grids from which the LaserDEM shiny colour drape images were made. A wet look shiny colour drape algorithm was applied to each of the 27 '2000 LaserDEM Grid' tiles using ERMapper®, and the results saved as Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images in both 8 bit (256 colour) and 24 bit (16 million colour) formats. Each wet look shiny colour drape DEM tile was also saved as an Enhanced Compressed Wavelet (ECW) image. The colour range has been optimized for each individual tile to provide maximum information. A consequence of this is that colours may not match at adjoining edges. Each image tile has a 1m pixel size. Most inland tiles and several coastal tiles are 2km x 2km in area. The inland tiles located at the edge of the flight path extent, and most coastal tiles, deviate from the 2km x 2km standard tile size as adjacent tiles have been merged to minimize areas of no data and ocean.  The advantage of the 2000 Laser DEM over previous DEMs is that the laser scanner used to produce the DEM was able to penetrate vegetation. Previous DEMs included the height of tree tops rather than the ground elevation obscured by vegetation. The 2000 Laser DEM therefore provides a more accurate and detailed picture of the ground surface of Christmas Island. Topographic features overgrown with vegetation are apparent on the 2000 Laser DEM shiny colour drape images, where in previous versions of CIGIS DEMs they were not.\n\nAAM Surveys Pty Ltd Indicate that the horizontal accuracy of the airborne laser scanner is between 0.3 and 0.5 metres.\n\nLaserDEM shiny colour drape image tiles have been produced for the eastern half of the island only, as only the eastern half of the island has been surveyed with the laser scanner.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

    "description": "The Macquarie Island Helicopter Exclusion Zone was created in January 2005 in consultation with Peter Cusick, Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania.  The zone was created by buffering the coastline by 1 km on the seaward side of the island, generally following the escarpment on the interior of the island and buffering the refuges by 200 m to create an approximately 400 m wide  corridor to the refuges. Access corridors were also created at the station.  The Australian Antarctic Data Centre's topographic data representing  coastline, escarpment and refuges was used. In March 2007 the zone was modifed in consultation with Terry Reid, Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania. The corridors to the refuges were extended through to the escarpment.  The Helicopter Exclusion Zone is shown in a map of the island (see link below).",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This publication summarises the forecasts presented in the December 2016 editions of ABARES Australian crop report and Agricultural commodities as well as material from an ABARES report on productivity in the Australian grains industry released in October 2016. \r\n\r\n This publication was commissioned by the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC). \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n\r\n World indicator prices of wheat and coarse grains are forecast to fall in 2016-17 as a result of expected plentiful supplies globally. In contrast, world oilseeds indicator prices are forecast to rise because of a fall in supplies in the early part of 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were generally in very good condition at the end of winter. Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tTotal area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tThe cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth--at 1.8 per cent--of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity growth include larger machinery and cropping equipment, new plant varieties, better water management and a better understanding of harvesting and planting strategies.

    "description": "The Marine Science voyage (VMS) was conducted on the Aurora Australis between 4 January 2011 and 6 February 2011. The voyage incorporated oceanographic measurements along the CLIVAR SR3 Transect and around the Mertz Glacier region. Underwater still images were collected from 93 sites ranging in depth from 170 m to 2300 m across George V shelf in East Antarctica. The camera equipment was designed and operated by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) marine science support team. The camera was attached to either the CTD frame or the beam trawl frame and lowered to 4-5 m from the seafloor and held in position for 2-15 minutes. All still images were stamped with UTC time. Stations were named according to the frame (e.g. CTD or BT), the sequence number of that particular frame (e.g. CTD53), followed by the instrument used (e.g. CAM for camera) and then the deployment number. For example, BT5_CAM16 was the fifth deployment using the beam trawl frame and the sixteenth camera deployment of the survey overall. For further information please refer to the post-survey report (GA Record 2011/xx - Geocat #71668)",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the formation top grids (or in some instances formation base) of the alluvial, volcanic and sedimentary bedrock hydrostratigraphic grids. They are based on a three-dimensional geological model developed in GoCAD&trade; and SKUA&trade; (Paradigm Geophysical Pty Ltd, version 2009.4 and version 2014.1, respectively).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThese layers are the binding surfaces (= formation tops or interfaces between different stratigraphic units) for the bioregion-wide three-dimensional geological model. These form the basis for the development of the volumetric three-dimensional geological model. The workflow for the model development is described in detail in Clarence-Moreton bioregional assessment product 2.1-2.2 (Raiber et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nThe sources for the binding surfaces are all geological data and digital elevation models (outlined in Raiber et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nThese include: \n\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model\n\nCoal seam gas, petroleum and stratigraphic wells\n\nGroundwater bores\n\nShapefiles of the extent of different stratigraphic units\n\nA table of revised formation tops provided by Metgasco Limited\n\nGrids of key formation tops (Richmond coal seams, Kangaroo Creek Sandstone, Gatton Sandstone and Koukandowie Formation) provided by Metgasco Limited\n\nGrids of formation tops provided by the NSW Department of Trade and Investment for stratigraphic units including the Walloon Coal Measures, Koukandowie Formation and other deeper layers.\n\n\n\nFrom these data sources, the 3D geological model was developed in GoCAD&trade; and SKUA&trade; (Paradigm Geophysical Pty Ltd, version 2009.4 and version 2014.1, respectively). An add-on on GoCAD, MIRA Mining utilities, was also extensively used. \n\n\n\nPrior to use, all data were subjected to considerable data quality check. Interfaces such as those between the alluvium and the underlying volcanic or sedimentary bedrock are based primarily on data from groundwater bores. The data cleaning process and the steps involved in creating these interfaces is described in detail in Clarence-Moreton bioregional assessment product 2.1-2.2 (Raiber et al., 2016).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) CLM bioregion 3D geological model.

    "description": "This data was collected in July 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2012_V03.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, July 11, 2012\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, July 24, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The Australian Lithospheric Architecture Magnetotelluric Project (AusLAMP) is a collaborative national survey that acquires long-period magnetotelluric data on a half-degree grid spacing (approximately 55 km) across the Australian continent. This project aims to map the electrical conductivity/resistivity structure in the crust and mantle beneath the Australian continent. Geoscience Australia has a significant investment in AusLAMP and is a key contributor to the delivery of this national program.\n\nGeoscience Australia, in partnership with State and Northern Territory Geological Surveys, has also undertaken regional-scale MT surveys, along onshore deep reflection seismic transects and in potential mineral and energy provinces across the country. The targeting signal range is 10 KHz – 1000 s, which provide an investigation depth from tens of metres to tens of kilometres. These data provide new insights into basement architecture and resource potential in these regions. \n\nWe will present some new models and results from AusLAMP data and regional survey data, showing a remarkable correlation between conductive anomalies, crustal-scale boundaries and the distribution of giant mineral deposits. For example, the Carpentaria Conductivity Anomaly at the eastern margin of the Mount Isa Province characterises the position and geometry of the ancient Gidyea Suture Zone. The distribution of known gold and copper deposits shows a close spatial correlation with the suture zone, indicating that this structure is potentially a fundamental control on IOCG deposits in its vicinity. The implication is that crustal-penetrating structures act as potential pathways for fluid movement to form mineral deposits in the upper crust.\n\nThis Abstract was submitted/presented to the Biennial Meeting of the Specialist Group for Tectonics and Structural Geology (SGTSG) and the Specialist Group in Solid Earth Geophysics (SGSEG), Convergence on the Coast, 18-22 November 2019 Port Lincoln, South Australia",

    "description": "Analysing the economic potential of forestry for carbon sequestration under alternative carbon price paths  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n The introduction of a carbon price under the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) may be effective in promoting afforestation in Australia and contribute to Australia's emissions target through carbon sequestration. Rates of sequestration will depend on the stringency of the emissions reduction target, and hence the level of the carbon price. However, the rate of afforestation arising because of the carbon price may potentially affect the attractiveness of agricultural land use activities in Australia. In general, higher carbon prices are expected to decrease the profitability and attractiveness of other land use activities, such as agriculture, in favour of timber plantations and environmental plantings which generate carbon credits under the CPRS. \r\n\r\n ABARE has been commissioned by the Commonwealth Treasury to estimate the potential increase in afforestation activity on agricultural land under four hypothetical scenarios and a reference case. The key assumptions underlying ABARE estimates are described in some detail in this report. Assumptions relating to the cost of investment of afforestation and the area of land available for switching are important determinants of the land use conversion. Afforestation activity is assumed to include the establishment of commercial plantations and environmental plantings between 2007 and 2100. ",

    "description": "The Tuncurry Passive Acoustic Observatory (near Tuncurry/Forster, NSW) consists of two to four moorings fitted with /hydrophones set on the seabed at 130-190 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of:\n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and\n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian).\n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",

    "description": "The Distribution Priority Area (DPA) classification system for GPs is a mechanism used by the Government to encourage a more equitable distribution of GPs who are restricted under s19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973, including International Medical Graduates (IMGs) and Foreign Graduates of Accredited Medical Schools (FGAMS).\r\n\r\n• The DPA classification system is also used to distribute Australian-trained Bonded doctors who have a return of service obligation.\r\n• The Distribution Priority Area (DPA) replaced the Districts of Workforce Shortage (DWS) system for GPs in 2019. DWS remains in use for non-GP specialists.\r\n• DPA considers the demographics of a region, including age, gender and socio-economic groupings, along with MBS activity data, to determine a benchmark figure that reflects community need for GP service.\r\n• DPA is calculated for 824 distinct, non-overlapping GP catchments throughout Australia. Catchments assessed below the benchmark are classified DPA.\r\n• Areas classified MM 2-7 under the Modified Monash Model (MMM) geographical remoteness classification system are automatically DPA. MM1 Inner metropolitan locations are automatically non-DPA. Areas that held DPA status prior to this update will continue to hold DPA status under a No Losers policy.\r\n\r\nThe attached file for the DPA is as at March 2025 (most recent annual update). As the files may be updated at short notice for program purposes, please ensure you use the Department of Health and Aged Care Health Workforce Locator (https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/health-workforce-locator) for the most up-to-date and official DPA location status.\r\n ",

    "description": "Summary of Management Plan\n\n(1) Most of the flood damage reduction measures considered as part of the 1993 Floodplain\nManagement Study cannot be justified on benefit-cost considerations. They could be\nreconsidered if new information becomes available that leads to substantially increased\nbenefit-cost ratios.\nNotwithstanding, Option 1E from the 1993 Floodplain Management Study was shown to have\na Benefit-Cost ratio of about 0.4 and therefore should be retained within the Plan. This\nfloodplain management strategy involved the voluntary raising of a 39 houses located in areas\nof Edgeworth, Barnsley and Boolaroo that are potentially flood affected. It is recommended\nthat these houses be re-assessed and prioritised in terms of their suitability for house raising.\nOnce a prioritised list has been determined, steps should be undertaken to implement the\nstrategy.\n(2) The Flood and Floodplain Management Studies on which this Plan is based should be revisited.\nThe reason for this and the process that should be followed is outlined in Appendix C.\nThe majority of the floodplain management options considered in the 1993 study are either\nnot viable from a cost/benefit perspective or may not be considered appropriate now. Hence,\ncontemporary floodplain management issues need to be determined through consultation with\nthe Committee and key stakeholders within the community. It is not clear whether any\nconsultation took place as part of earlier studies. However, this is considered to be essential\nto managing future flooding issues that may arise along creek system and its floodplain. This\ncould be achieved by distribution of a brochure similar to that included in Appendix A.\n(3) Development within areas defined in Figure 4 as 2A, 2B and 2C, should be able to proceed\nwithout extensive independent flood investigations, provided all appropriate requirements\nspecified by the current Local Environment Plan are addressed (eg., those related to filling).\n(4) Development Restrictions Flooding/Tidal Inundation Certificates should be revised to\nincorporate the predicted peak level of the Probable Maximum Flood or an ‘extreme’ flood.\nThe format of Development Restrictions Flooding/Tidal Inundation Certificates could be\nmodified to provide more information.\n(5) Further investigations need to be undertaken to determine whether flood damage reduction\nmeasures can be implemented for those problem areas listed in Section 4.3.1\n(6) Further hydraulic investigations should be undertaken the determine the amount of time\nbefore inundation of key areas along Cockle Creek in a typical major flood.\n(7) A flood liable lands DCP is to be developed specifically for the Cockle Creek catchment. The\nDCP would effectively serve as a revised Flood Policy and relate to the specifics of flood\nbehaviour in the catchment (as distinct from the lake inundation flood behaviour that applies\nin other areas of Lake Macquarie City).",

The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "title": "Forest Productivity Index (Version 1.0 -Sept 2024  Release)",
    "description": "The Full Carbon Accounting Model (FullCAM) was developed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the land sector, for inclusion in Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Accounts produced annually. Forest Productivity Index (FPI) data is used within FullCAM during the modelling process, to incorporate the impact of climate variability on yields of woody biomass.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of forest growth is fundamental to estimating the carbon stocks (and biomass) of mature forests and rates of carbon accumulation in any forest regrowth. \r\n\r\nThe FPI estimates forest growth using a simplified version of the 3-PG (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) growth model, as described in Australian Greenhouse Office Technical Report No.23 (Kesteven et al. 2004). The growth model is based on the relationship between the amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies (APAR) and various productivity modifiers that affect plant growth. \r\n\r\nTo create the FPI a wide variety of inputs are used including various soil and climate inputs as well as a normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI provides an estimate of vegetation health and a means of monitoring changes in vegetation over time and is one of the most common vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data. \r\n\r\nThe product release contains 37 folder zip files which cover the continent of Australia. Each zip files holds 53 yearly FPI raster tif files of approximately 1km resolution on GDA94 from 1970 to 2022. \r\n",

    "description": "In recent years the term 'enhanced greenhouse effect' has become well known in modern society and yet aspects of this possible 'future climate' are poorly understood. The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. From core MD032607 the annual mean SST (Tmean) indicates a temperature range of 9oC±0.84oC between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to MIS 5, representing the largest sea surface temperature (SST) transition from a glacial to interglacial. The results also suggest that there is more stratification in the water column during interglacial periods as opposed to glacials. Conversely, temperatures gradients are reduced during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and MIS 6 suggesting a well mixed homogenised mixed layer.",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ### \r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nAs at 15 December 2017, over 48,500 registered charities had submitted their 2016 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2016 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

The interest can involve physical\naspects, such as the use of land, or conceptual rights, such as a right to use the land in the future.\nThe NSW cadastre is an up to date parcel based land information system which contains a unique identifier which can be linked of interests in land (i.e. rights, restrictions and responsibilities). The cadastre includes a geometric definition of land parcels linked\nto other records, such as land titles, describing the nature of the interests, the ownership or control of those interests, and often the value of the parcel and its improvements.\nA cadastral product or service visualises the boundaries of land parcels, often buildings on land, the parcel identifier, and basic topographic features.\nThe land parcel and property theme provides the foundation fabric of land ownership. It consists of the digital cadastral database and associated parcel and property information.",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key issues  • There has been a generally favourable start to the 2016-17 winter crop season, especially in Western Australia. Seasonal conditions have been more varied in the eastern states but there was timely above average rainfall in late autumn and early winter in these states. \r\n• According to the latest three-month rainfall outlook (June to August 2016) issued by the Bureau of Meteorology on 26 May 2016, winter rainfall is likely to be above average in most cropping regions. \r\n• The total area planted to winter crops in Australia is forecast to increase by around 1 per cent in 2016-17 to 22.3 million hectares. The area planted to canola, oats and some pulses is forecast to increase. However, the area planted to wheat and barley is forecast to decline, reflecting more favourable expected returns from growing other crops. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2016-17 to 42.3 million tonnes, which largely reflects a forecast increase in average yields. \r\n• Harvesting of 2015-16 summer crops is now largely complete. Total Australian summer crop production is estimated to have fallen by 13 per cent in 2015-16 to 3.7 million tonnes, largely because of a fall in rice production\r\n",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed at the entrance of Jervis Bay, off Point Perpendicular. This mooring housed 2 current meters, at 12m and 34m. Over a period of approx. 1yr the mooring was deployed 5 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1,3, 4 & 5 - 35.1 S, 150.797 E. Deployment 2 - 35.0983 S, 150.793 E. Datasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the two current meters over the year. \n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 5 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets, present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2, 3, 4, 5). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1)  5/4/89 - 4/6/89... 2) 23/6/89 - 28/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 13/11/89... 4) 14/11/89 - 29/1/90... 5) 31/1/90 - 28/3/90\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 3. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "Modified Monash Model (MMM)\r\n \r\nThe Modified Monash Model (MMM) is a classification system used to define the remoteness of Australian locations, ranging from MM 1 (major cities) to MM 7 (very remote areas). It combines population size and geographic remoteness to guide health workforce planning, especially in rural and remote communities. MMM is based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) and is updated after each national Census conducted by the ABS.\r\n \r\nMesh Blocks\r\n \r\nMesh Blocks are the smallest geographic areas defined by the ABS and form the building blocks for the larger regions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). They broadly identify land use such as residential, commercial, primary production and parks. Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1s) are generally the smallest geographic unit used to release Census of Population and Housing data; however, for ASGS Edition 3, limited Census of Population and Housing data may also be available at the Mesh Block level.\r\nAs Mesh Blocks are very small they can be combined together to accurately approximate a large range of other geographies.",

    "description": "The 23 Conservation Management Zones of Australia are geographic areas, classified according to their ecological and threat characteristics. The zones are also aligned with the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia.\n\nThe Conservation Management Zones provide a way of understanding Australia’s natural environment that will assist in long-term conservation planning and help the Australian Government to better design, deliver and report on Natural Resource Management (NRM) investments, including ensuring alignment of national NRM priorities with local action.\n\nThe Conservation Management Zones also provide a filter through which to make national environmental and socio-economic data regionally meaningful, accessible and comprehensible to all. \n\nThey provide a framework for gathering on-ground knowledge and expertise about the environment. This will improve information flow to the Australian Government and other key decision makers about regional NRM requirements, best practice management, emerging NRM issues and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe Conservation Management Zones do not represent any change to existing administrative boundaries or governance structures, but aim to support the NRM and wider community to cooperatively manage environmental assets across boundaries, where they share common threats, ecological characteristics and stakeholders.\n\nThe project builds on the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia (IBRA) which has been used to support planning of the National Reserve System, but consolidates the 85 mainland IBRA regions into 23 Conservation Management Zones, where IBRA regions share common characteristics.\n\nFurther information and profiles describing the zones can be accessed throught the Department of the Environment and Energys web site at - https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/conservation-management-zonesCC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Australia Licence.

    "title": "Riparian Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "IMOS is designed to be a fully-integrated, national system, observing at ocean-basin and regional scales, and covering physical, chemical and biological variables. IMOS Facilities, operated by ten different institutions within the National Innovation System, are funded to deploy equipment and deliver data streams for use by the entire Australian marine and climate science community and its international collaborators.\nThe IMOS Ocean Portal (http://imos.aodn.org.au) allows marine and climate scientists and other users to discover and explore data streams coming from all of the Facilities ¿ some in near-real time, and all as delayed-mode, quality-controlled data. These data streams, long time-series that are ¿under construction¿, represent the actual research infrastructure being created and developed by IMOS.\nIMOS observations are guided by science planning undertaken collaboratively across the Australian marine and climate science community. IMOS now has a National Science and Implementation Plan that draws on the intellectual strength of its six science Nodes ¿ a ¿Bluewater and Climate¿ Node focused on the open ocean, and five ¿Regional Nodes¿ covering the continental shelf and coastal seas of Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Southern Australia and Tasmania. Leaders of the Nodes come together to form a national steering committee that oversees the whole process, and IMOS science plans are subjected to international peer review on a rolling basis to ensure the planned science is world-class. \n\nThere are five major research themes that unify IMOS science plans and related observations:\n1. Multi-decadal ocean change,\n2. Climate variability and weather extremes\n3. Major boundary currents and interbasin flows\n4. Continental shelf processes, and\n5. Ecosystem responses (productivity, abundance and distribution).\n\nIMOS is supported by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and the Super Science Initiative. It is led by the University of Tasmania on behalf of the Australian marine and climate science community.",

This subset of the data contains 77,693 ADCP profile records from 155 voyages and includes corrected U and V values at a centred binned depth and spans from 1995 to the present.\n\nThe full data set is held in the O&A Information & Datacentre Data Warehouse, which currently holds over 387,181 ADCP profile records from more than 222 voyages collected since 1987.  This data includes corrected U and V values at a centred binned depth.  Individual metadata records have been created for each research voyage.",

They include areas of sediment supply (sources), sediment loss (sinks), and the sediment transport processes linking them (pathways). Sediment transport pathways include both alongshore and cross-shore processes, and therefore cells are best represented in two-dimensions. They are natural management units with a physical basis and commonly cross jurisdictional boundaries. ",

It was created (June 2003 - Feb 2004) from migrating LCMP layers into the Vicmap structure.\n\nThis layer contains all water supply licence and pipe boundaries, as defined by Assett Information  Management. The Pipe boundaries have been reconciled against Departmental records. All lines have a LIMS  \"Tenure number\" in the TENURE_ID field where the area is licenced. The \"Tenure number\" is used as a key into the LIMS text system (PORTAL) for further details.\n\nThe database is continually maintained, obtaining maintenance from authoritative sources within State Government.",

The information in this report was collected on behalf of the Australian wine sector in the winegrowing regions in Australia. Wine Australia wine grape levy payers (approximately 2,000 businesses) were surveyed in the Wine Sector Survey. The response rate to the survey was around 27 per cent of businesses surveyed; this includes wineries known to have crushed over 10,000 tonnes, and is estimated to account for 88 per cent of all wine grapes crushed in 2017.\nThe Winery Residues dataset is represented spatially as Geographical Indications (GI) Regions of Australia. Only defined GI regions where the total collected tonnage exceeds 1,000 tonnes have been included.\nInformation including metadata and data sources is available on the RenewablesSA website. \nhttp://www.renewablessa.sa.gov.au/investor-information/bio-energy-roadmap/biomass-for-bioenergy-assessment",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who had an episiotomy when giving birth for the first time and giving birth vaginally and non-instrumentally, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their first baby who had an episiotomy during a non-instrumental vaginal birth, divided by the number of females having their first baby who gave birth vaginally and had a non-instrumental vaginal birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth for the first time and had a vaginal birth, with or without instruments. Females who had a multiple birth are included if this was the first time they had given birth.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who did not give birth for the first time or gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nNon-instrumental vaginal births include spontaneous vaginal and vaginal breech.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, a combined laceration and episiotomy value could be recorded; from 2014 onwards, episiotomy could be recorded separately.\n\n\nData were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC11) was collected from a depth of 502 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. The smallest size fraction (<100µm) dominates at all depths, and is particularly pronounced during glacial periods, at 460cm (MIS 10) and at 330cm (MIS 8).",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

The data spans the months of 2015 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Pilbara array, in combination with the Kimberly array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Pilbara line will help document the variability  in the the northward flowing Ningaloo Current, characterised by cooler waters. In addition, the Pilbara coast is characterised by high evaporation, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "Ambulance Victoria has two official response time targets: Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 85% of incidents state-wide, and\nRespond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 90% of incidents in centres with populations greater than 7,500. Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1,\" and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria. Local government in Victoria comprises of 79 municipal districts. They are\noften referred to as local government areas (LGAs). The number of LGAs\nand their boundaries can change over time. LGAs are as defined by Local\nGovernment Victoria, which is part of the Department of Transport,\nPlanning and Local Infrastructure.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a medical specialist in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 1 month average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Vlaming Sub-basin in March and April 2012 to provide seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of this sedimentary basin. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The Vlaming Sub-basin is located offshore from Perth, Western Australia, and was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially highly suitable for CO2 storage. The principal aim of the Vlaming Sub-basin marine survey (GA survey number GA334) was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Vlaming Sub-basin that may extend up to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota in the areas of interest to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the Early Cretaceous Gage Sandstone (the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit) and the regional integrity of the South Perth Shale (the seal unit that overlies the Gage Sandstone). This dataset comprises %carbonate and specific surface area of seabed sediments.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The data covers the years of 2009-2013 and is aggregated by Local Government Areas (LGA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). This dataset is part of the Victorian Department of Education and Training's Victorian Child and Adolescent Monitoring System (VCAMS) data release. This dataset is sourced from the School Entrant Health Questionnaire (SEHQ).\nThe VCAMS Framework comprises 150 indicators as agreed by the Children's Service Coordination Board. It incorporates 35 outcomes that relate to aspects of children's health, development, safety, learning and well-being in four categories - the child, families, community, and supports and services.\nFor more information, please visit VCAMS Indicators.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"NDP\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of all women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAn antenatal visit is a planned visit between a pregnant woman and a midwife or doctor to assess and improve the wellbeing of the mother and baby throughout pregnancy. An antenatal visit does not include a visit where the sole purpose of contact is to confirm the pregnancy, or those contacts that occurred during the pregnancy that related to other non-pregnancy related issues. An antenatal visit in the first trimester is defined as occurring before 14 weeks' gestational age.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid\n\n\nIn WA and ACT, first antenatal visits that occur outside of the hospital may not be included, so these data should be interpreted with caution\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit for the area is less than 100\n\n",

    "description": "The CSIRO Ship of Opportunity Underway pCO2 system is mounted on the Research Vessel Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) of the Australian Marine National Facility.\r\n\r\nCO2 System Overview:\r\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater is measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser that is used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 in-air standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured immediately after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \r\n\r\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\r\nThe ships seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than the equilibrator. \r\n\r\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "Endemic plants provide an important insight into the process of evolution of flora and are of direct relevance to National Estate criterion A1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate.\n\nIn some cases, where concentrations of endemic taxa occur, the role of climatic refugia in speciation during periods of climate change becomes apparent. In other cases, endemism is high without any apparent link to refugia: biogeographic determinants such as terrestrial and oceanic climatic influences, soils and localised topographic variation may be the main controlling factors in these cases. \n\nThe degree of endemism of flora is pronounced in Tasmania, a consequence of a variety of factors, such as Pleistocene glaciations and deglaciations and periodic isolation when sea-level fluctuations caused the closing of the land bridge across Bass Strait. More than 300 higher plant taxa are endemic in the region. Endemism is moderate at the generic level; for example, there are 10 endemic, mostly monotypic, angiosperm genera. Lower levels of endemism are seen in lichens, mosses and ferns. \n\nThis database describes the centres of endemism of flora, i.e. areas where concentrations of exclusively Tasmanian flora species are found. \n\nCentres of endemic flora are coded with a unique number and the relevant National Estate value and criterion. The data are mapped at 1:500,000 scale.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",
