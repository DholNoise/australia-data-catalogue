    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on the known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the spatial location of all works associated with surface water licences from NSW in the BA regions. The short guide to NSW Office of Water's licensing data has been provided to accompany the dataset (both the spatial locations and the associated licence details). \n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act).\n\n2.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n3.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n4.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n5.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading). This means a spatial select with not find these WALs and the volumes associated with them. The WAL is still related to a particular Water Source and can be re-associated with a different Licensed Work Approval at a later date.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset was extracted from the NSW Office of Water's licensing system. Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area supplied by the Bioregional Assessment project teams for each area.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2013) NSW Office of Water Surface Water Entitlements Locations v1_Oct2013.

    "description": "Suburbs and Localities (SAL)\r\nSuburbs and Localities, formerly State Suburbs, are an ABS Mesh Block approximation of the officially recognised boundaries of suburbs (in cities and larger towns) and localities (outside cities and larger towns) as defined by State and Territory governments of Australia. These boundaries are created to enable the release of ABS data on areas that approximate official localities, allowing comparison of ABS data with other locality-based datasets.\r\nCustodian: The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is the data custodian for SAL boundaries.\r\nNote: ABS approximations of administrative boundaries do not match official legal boundaries and should only be used for statistical purposes.\r\n\r\nPostal Areas (POA)\r\nPostal Areas are an ABS Mesh Block approximation of a general definition of postcodes. They enable comparison of ABS data with other datasets collected using postcodes as the geographic reference.\r\nCustodian: The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is the data custodian for POA boundaries.\r\nNote: ABS approximations of administrative boundaries do not match official legal boundaries and should only be used for statistical purposes.\r\n\r\nModified Monash Model (MMM)\r\nThe Modified Monash Model (MMM) is a classification system used to define the remoteness of Australian locations, ranging from MM 1 (major cities) to MM 7 (very remote areas). It combines population size and geographic remoteness to guide health workforce planning, especially in rural and remote communities. MMM is based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) and is updated after each national Census conducted by the ABS.\r\nCustodian: The Department of Health is the data custodian for MMM boundaries.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

The reported statistics include year of death, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates, rate ratio, median age at death, premature deaths, potential years of life lost and potentially avoidable deaths. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any SA3 with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2014 provides both spatial and text information about government, indigenous and privately protected areas for continental Australia. State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current to 30 June 2014. This is the ninth version of the database, with previous versions released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012.  \n\nThe Department also publishes protected areas data for the marine environment. \"CAPAD 2014-marine\" contains spatial and text information about offshore protected areas, for both State and Commonwealth waters. Previous versions of CAPAD marine information have been published in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012. \n\nCAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area:\"A protected area is an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means\" (IUCN 1994).\n\nThe department publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad/ This version of CAPAD 2014 is a public and downloadable version of CAPAD 2014 data, available for use through the CC-BY licencing model. \n\nMain attributes in the full version of CAPAD 2014 include:\n\nPA_ID: The protected area ID code. Created from RES_NUMBER if unique, otherwise it is a DoE generated number.\n\nNAME: the name of the protected area. Gazetted PAs with no name are flagged as \"Unnamed\" with a reserve number. \n\nTYPE: the type of protected area according to the protected area establishment mechanism. \n\nTYPE_ABBR: the abbreviation of the TYPE.\nACCP\tConservation Covenant\nASMA\tAntarctic Specially Managed Area\nASPA\tAntarctic Specially Protected Area\nBG\tBotanic Gardens\nCA\tConservation Area\nCCA\tCoordinated Conservation Area\nCCAZ1\tCCA Zone 1 National Park\nCCAZ3\tCCA Zone 3 State Conservation Area\nCOR\tCoastal Reserve\nCP\tConservation Park\nCR\tCoastal Reserve\nFLR\tFlora Reserve\nFR\tForest Reserve\nGR\tGame Reserve\nHA\tHeritage Agreement\nHIR\tHistorical Reserve\nHPOT\tBiodiversity Hotspot\nHR\tHeritage River\nHS\tHistoric Site\nHTR\tHunting Reserve\nIPA\tIndigenous Protected Area\nKCR\tKarst Conservation Reserve\nMA\tManagement Agreement\nMAA\tManagement Agreement Area\nMCP\tNational Parks Act Schedule 4 park or reserve\nMNP\tMarine National Park\nMR\tMiscellaneous Reserve\nMS\tMarine Sanctuary\nNAP\tNature Park\nNCA\tNatural Catchment Area\nNCR\tNature Conservation Reserve\nNFR\tNatural Features Reserve\nNP\tNational Park\nNPA\tNational Park Aboriginal\nNPC\tNational Park (Commonwealth)\nNR\tNature Reserve\nNRA\tNature Recreation Area\nNREF\tNature Refuge\nNRS\tNRS Addition - Gazettal in Progress\nOCA\tOther Conservation Area\nOCA/NAP\tOther Conservation Area / Nature Park\nOP\tOther\nPA\tProtected Area\nPNPA\tProposed National Parks Act park or park addition\nPNR\tPrivate Nature Reserve\nPPP\tPermanent Park Preserve\nPS\tPrivate Sanctuary\nRA\tReference Area\nREP\tRegional Park\nRNA\tRemote and Natural Area - not scheduled under NPA/Remote and Natural Area - Schedule 6, National Parks Act (Abbreviated as Remote and Natural Area - not scheduled under Nat Parks Act) \nRP\tRecreation Park\nRR Regional Reserve\nS5G 5(1)(g)\tReserve\nS5H 5(1)(h)\tReserve\nSCA\tState Conservation Area\nSP\tState Park\nSR\tState Reserve\nWPA\tWilderness Protection Area\nWP\tWilderness Park\nWZ\tWilderness Zone\n\nIUCN: the IUCN protected area management category ascribed by the Managing authority, as outlined in the publication: CNPPA/WCMC \"Guidelines for Protected Area management categories\". Gland: IUCN, 1994. (ISBN: 2-8317-0201-1).\n\nDefinitions include:\nIA\tStrict Nature Reserve: managed mainly for science;\nIB\tWilderness Area: managed mainly for wilderness protection;\nII\tNational Park: managed mainly for ecosystem protection;\nIII\tNatural Monument: managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features;\nIV\tHabitat / Species Management Area: managed mainly for conservation through management intervention;\nV\tProtected Landscape / Seascape: managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation;\nVI\t Managed Resource Protected Area: managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems.\n\nGAZ_AREA: area in hectares as described in the nomination document (e.g. parliamentary gazettal), to the nearest hectare. Some protected areas do not have a specific area in the designation.\n\nGIS_AREA: area in hectares based on current spatial data and an Albers equal area projection for Australia. Where protected area consists of multiple polygons (parts) the GIS_AREA is the sum of all the polygons with the same name, type, state and IUCN category. It is this field that is used to calculate the statistics provided in spreadsheets at: www.environment.gov.au/capad/\n\nREPT_AREA is the same with GIS_AREA (previously REPT_AREA is in hectares from the GAZ_AREA attribute and if this is a null value then the GIS_AREA is used. For Protected areas with multiple records, REPT_AREA is a calculated by dividing GAZ_AREA by GIS_AREA of the total then applying this factor to the GIS_AREA of the record). Due to the fact that not all received data have REPT_AREA, it is incomplete and inconsistent if REPT_AREA is used for analysis. \n\nGAZ_DATE: the first gazettal or proclamation date that established any protected area at this site. \n\nLATEST_GAZ: the date of the most recent gazettal or proclamation to add land to the protected area. It can be the same date as the GAZ_AREA.\n\nNRS_PA: This attribute indicates the status of the protected area as part of the National Reserve System (NRS). \"Y\" = Yes. A protected area located within the State and Territory jurisdiction \"I\" = an interim protected area - in the process of being gazetted/established. \"N\" = No. A protected area that does not meet the NRS criteria. \"ND\" = No Data. A protected area that does not meet NRS criteria, but compliments the NRS with sympathetic management.\n\nSTATE: The state is the state that the protected area is located in. EXT= protected areas located in Australian external territories.\n\nAUTHORITY: The Authority responsible for the management of the protected area mechanism. \nAAD\tAustralian Antarctic Division\nAC_SA\tAlexandrina Council\nACT_TAMSD\tACT Territory and Municipal Services Directorate\nAWC\tAustralian Wildlife Conservancy\nAWC & BA\tAustralian Wildlife Conservancy & Birds Australia\nBBT\tBookmark Biosphere Trust\nBHA\tBush Heritage Australia\nCCC_QLD\tCaloundra City Council\nCR PTY LTD\tConservation Reserves PTY LTD\nDOE\tAustralian Government, Department of the Environment\nEAC_QLD\tEwamian Aboriginal Corporation\nEL Inc._NSW\tEnduring Landscapes Inc.\nFC_NSW\tForestry Commission of NSW\nFPR Inc.\tFriends of the Porongurup Range (Inc)\nGCC_NSW\tGosford City Council\nHCR_CMA\tHunter - Central Rivers Catchment Management Authority\nILC_NT\tIndigenous Land Corporation\nIMG\tIndigenous management group\nIMG, LILC\tIndigenous management group and Local Indigenous Land Council\nKRGC_NSW\tKu-ring-gai Council\nLHI_Board\tLord Howe Island Board\nLILC\tLocal Indigenous Land Council\nLVRC_Q_EPA\tLockyer Valley Regional Council and QLD EPA\nMINCA_QLD\tMagnetic Island Nature Care Association\nNF SA Inc.\tNature Foundation SA Inc\nNSC_QLD\tNoosa Shire Council\nNSW_OEH\tNSW Office of Environment and Heritage\nNT_PWCNT\tParks and Wildlife Commission of the NT\nQLD_DERM\tQueensland Department of Environment and Resource Management\nQLD_EHP\tQueensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection\nQLD_EPA\tQueensland Environment Protection Agency\nQLD_NPRSR\tQueensland Department of National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing\nSA_DEH\tSouth Australian Department of Environment and Heritage\nSA_DEWNR\tSouth Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources\nF_SA\tForestry South Australia\nSCRC_QLD\tSunshine Coast Regional Council\nTAS_DPIPWE\tTasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment\nTAS_WPMT\tWellington Park Management Trust Tasmania\nTFN_VIC\tTrust for Nature (Victoria)\nTLC Inc_TAS\tTasmanian Land Conservancy Inc.\nTSRA\tTorres Strait Regional Authority\nTTTN\tThe Trustee for the Trust for Nature\nU.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for September 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2015 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp. Other Territories (LGA code 99399) were split across two records in the original data, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "title": "Argo float : a platform of the IMOS Argo Australia Facility",
    "description": "Argo floats have revolutionised our understanding of the broad scale structure of the oceans to 2000 m depth. In the past 10 years more high resolution hydrographic profiles have been provided by Argo floats then from the rest of the observing system put together.\n\nEach Argo float is identified by a unique identification number called a WMO ID. WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) ID Numbers are assigned to measurement stations and observing platforms to enable researchers to keep track of, and uniquely identify their floats.\n\nArgo floats alter their buoyancy by using a battery pack and motor to drive oil from inside the float to an external bladder. This changes the floats volume and thus its density relative to the surrounding seawater allowing it to move up and down through the water column. \n\nA typical Argo float mission is to profile from 2000 m depth to the sea surface every 10 days. On deployment, the float sinks to a depth of 1000 m and drifts with the ocean currents for 9 days. Then the float sinks deeper to its profile depth (usually 2000 m) before starting to ascend through the water column measuring temperature, salinity and pressure as it rises. Once at the surface it transmits location and profile data via satellite to land-based Argo data centres. After transmission the float sinks again and repeats the cycle. \n\nThe average life of the latest model APEX Argo floats are around 3.7 years or approximately 135 cycles. These statistics are for floats with the standard alkaline battery configuration from an analysis by Kobayashi et al (2009).In the Australian Argo program, the floats are deployed with a combination of lithium and alkaline battery packs which extends float lifetime. Argo Australia floats usually last 7 years and several floats are approaching their 9th birthday and are still returning good data.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of family incidents retrieved from Victoria Police. The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of family incidents per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of family incidents recorded in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: Family Incident Rate = (Number of Family Incidents/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe data contains information collected by Victoria Police on the L17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Report. \n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nData was extracted from the Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP) on 18 July 2018.\n\n",

These runs have been completed using only bias corrected SST(Sea Surface Temperatures) and Sea Ice (No Atmospheric) forcings. 4X Daily atmospheric variables are available globally at 18 levels with .5º (60km) resolution on a C64 Grid. There are 1680 daily files in netcdf format, totaling approximately 2.47 TB. Regional climate data is also available for CCAM nested in other GCMS as part of this project. This dataset has also been further downscaled to 14km resolution for the Tasmania region.",

The models were developed through workshops with a wide variety of stakeholders, including community groups, government agencies, researchers, managers and non-government organisations, and discussions with individuals or small groups following the workshops.\n\nEach model was used to assess the current situation and the drivers of change that were negatively impacting the focal asset. Potential management strategies were then identified and the ‘best case management strategy’, where both model stability and asset management were improved, was incorporated in a ‘future’ model. \n\nCommon themes that arose throughout this process were the need to improve water quality throughout the estuary and nearby rivers by reducing nutrient input from various sources, and the need to alter current governance structures to allow effective environmental management.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the phytoplankton abundance and biovolume estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly phytoplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is an integrated water sample collected with niskin bottles at 10m depth intervals and preserved in lugols solution. The depth of the sample varies at each station. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition / abundance (cells/l) 2. Biovolume (um3/L). Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

    "description": "Temperate WA (Kendrick, Babcock, Smale): A cruise was undertaken in collaboration with the University of Western Australian and CSIRO to document benthic assemblages on temperate reefs off the coast of Western Australia in April, 2010. This cruise was the first in a 3 year series of IMOS AUV Facility cruises intended to establish a benthic habitat timeseries along the Eastern and Western coasts of Australia. The expectation is that these surveys will be repeated annually for at least the next two years. Surveys were conducted off Rottnest Island, Jurien Bay, and the Abrolhos Islands. Six sites were surveyed at each location spanning three depths (15 m, 25 m, 40 m), both inside and outside MPAs, with three 25 m x 25 m full photo coverage quadrants devoted to each site. Site locations targeted kelp beds and were provided by the science party. The locations of individual quadrants within each site were decided on‐site, based on bathymetric or depth sounder information. Additional scientific operations carried out during the cruise consisted of CTD casts, HOBO logger equipped moorings deployments, and SCUBA.",

    "description": "<strong><em>This dataset is available on Brisbane City Council’s open data website – <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au\">data.brisbane.qld.gov.au</a>. The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from creeks inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the overall Flood Awareness Map.\n\nCreek flooding occurs when intense rain falls over a creek catchment. Runoff from houses, streets, parks etc contributes to creek flooding. Once the capacity of the creek is reached, overtopping of the banks will occur which can cause flooding. Creek floodwaters can be very fast moving and rise and recede quickly without much warning.\n\nThere are four different creek flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe creek High likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) from BCC’s flood inundation extents usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 5% AEP (20 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Medium likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Low likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Very Low likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).",

The On Track survey seeks to: Offer a consistent and comprehensive approach to monitoring the transitions of school leavers; Report the information to schools, TAFE institutions and other education providers, organisations concerned with assisting young people, policy makers, parents and students; Provide detailed analysis of the transitions experienced by different groups of leavers; Enable education providers to use the findings to monitor and improve their programs; and Provide a referral service for school leavers who appear to be experiencing difficulties in the transition process.\nOn Track survey data is based on the number of students who responded to the 2019 On Track survey. This is a proportion of those who consented to participate in the On Track survey within the school.\nMoreover, the information about the survey as well as the annual results (current and historical) are also available from DET website (https://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/research/Pages/ontrack.aspx), where the datasets are listed and available in the Data and reports &gt; Year 12 completers summary section.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Katherine for 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a08.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The data is aggregated to Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2), according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 3235.0) available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data.\n\n\nRegions which contain unpublished data have been left blank in the dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "The digital '1:2 500 000 geological map of Western Australia' comprises four layers: the primary 1:2 500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:2 500 000 State Cenozoic geology, the 1:2 500 000 State interpreted dyke suites, and the 1:2 500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology structural lines. The 1:2 500 000 interpreted geology contains geoscience data covering themes such as geology and tectonic boundaries that have been digitally rolled up from 1:500 000 data sources for optimal display at 1:2 500 000 scale. The Cenozoic geology layer can be superimposed over the bedrock layer to allow the extension of older bedrock geology under Cenozoic cover where geological and geophysical information permits, and to depict Cenozoic paleovalleys and additional significant Cenozoic cover. The dyke suites layer is primarily interpreted from aeromagnetic data, using mapped dyke extents as a guide. Individual dykes are assigned to named dyke suites wherever possible. The attribution of linear structures and dykes as concealed or exposed takes into account both the interpreted bedrock and the Cenozoic geology layers and does not reflect regolith cover. Detailed fault attribution has been simplified from the 1:500 000 scale, except in the case of major fault systems or tectonic boundaries. The nomenclature and hierarchy of lithostratigraphic units is based on the GSWA weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships and include more recent geochronology. Stratigraphic units are mostly displayed at greater than or equal to Group or Suite level; Subgroups and Formations are only displayed where areal extent warrants it and the unit does not have a higher order parent.

    "description": "The Western Margin survey (GA survey #2476) was conducted on the R.V. Sonne between 25 October 2008 and 19 January 2009 in collaboration with staff from the Western Australia Geological Survey and the University of the Sea. The voyage was operated through the Offshore Energy Security Program, with the principal aims of acquiring geological, geophysical, oceanographic, and biological data over poorly known areas of Australia's western continental margin. A total of 44 video transects were surveyed, with an associated 6,229 still photographs acquired from water depth of 831-4,827 m. Video was recorded to mini DV tapes, and copied to digital format. Video snippets were also created of representative habitats for some stations. Video and image files or associated parent folders are named according to station number, followed by gear code (CAM  = OFOS camera which collected still images and video, GR = BODO grab which collected black and white video) and then the deployment number. For example 36GR19 represents a video transect from Station 36 that was the 19th video transect from the BODO grab on the survey. For further information on this survey please refer to the post-survey report (GA Record 2009/38 - Geocat #69606) and GA Record 2009/26 (Geocat #69358).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Applications of these data include solar energy, agriculture, building thermal design and water balance modelling. Climatologies are given for two radiation parameters: the global horizontal exposure, which is the total amount of solar energy falling on a horizontal surface over a time interval; and the direct normal exposure which is the total of the component of radiation from the sun’s disk on a plane perpendicular to the beam. Climatologies of daily exposure are given as an annual average and as a set of twelve monthly averages. Climatologies of the diurnal cycle are given as monthly averages of hourly exposures through the day. These data sets are derived from 23 years (1990 - 2012) of data from satellites operated by Japan Meteorological Agency and the US National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric Administration. NEII",

The dataset includes information in the following specified areas regarding persons born overseas: Overseas Born Population, Year of Arrival in Australia, Australian Citizenship, Religious Affiliation, English Proficiency, Non-School Qualifications, Occupation of Employed Persons, Labour Force and Total Personal Income (Weekly).\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data with the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) LGA 2019 dataset.\n\n\nSome data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.\n\n\nWhere data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.\n\n\nColumns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.\n\n",

    "title": "Assessment of Swamp Oak Floodplain Forest TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate (South Coast Region)",
    "description": "The operational map for Swamp Oak Floodplain Forest (SOFF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast. \nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for SOFF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that SOFF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of SOFF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas.\nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain SOFF. We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of SOFF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the SOFF determination.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to SOFF based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and model output underlying each API polygon. \nIn total, we mapped approximately 272 hectares of SOFF across our full study area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "In 2005 Geoscience Australia and the National Oceans Office undertook a joint project to produce a consistent, high-quality 9 arc second (0.0025 decimal degree (dd) or ~250m at the equator) bathymetric grid for Australian waters. In 2009 a number of new datasets were included in an updated version of the grid.\n, The 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia was produced to include recently acquired datasets, and solutions to issues identified in the previous version. The revised grid has the same extents as its 2005 counterpart, including the Australian water column jurisdiction lying between 92o E and 172o E, and 8o S and 60o S. The waters adjacent to the continent of Australia and Tasmania are included, as are areas surrounding Macquarie Island, and the Australian Territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The area selected does not include Australia's marine jurisdiction offshore from the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory.\n, As per the 2005 grid, the 0.0025 dd resolution is only supported where direct bathymetric observations are sufficiently dense (e.g. where swath bathymetry data or digitised chart data exist) (Webster and Petkovic, 2005). In areas where no sounding data are available (in waters off the Australian shelf), the grid is based on the 2 arc minute ETOPO (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) and 1 arc minute ETOPO (Amante and Eakins, 2008) satellite derived bathymetry. The topographic data (on shore data) is based on the revised Australian 0.0025dd topography grid (Geoscience Australia, 2008), the 0.0025dd New Zealand topography grid (Geographx, 2008) and the 90m SRTM DEM (Jarvis et al, 2008).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nBoth the floodway and flood fringe make up the 1 in 100 (1%) annual exceedance probability (AEP) floodplain, however there are areas where the floodplain exists, but the floodway and flood fringe does not. In such situations, a different floodplain management strategy applies (for example, the Swan River between the Narrows and Canning Bridges).\n\nThis dataset contains four lines - Floodway limit, Extent of 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flooding, Extent of floodway &amp; Extent of study. \n\nThe Floodway limit, Extent of floodway and Extent of 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Flooding and Extent of study line types are boundaries which appropriately overlay over the \"FPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Areas\" (polygon) dataset. \n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River – Toodyay, Northam, York and Beverley Townsites. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nBlackwood River – Augusta, Bridgetown, Nannup and Boyup Brook Townsites.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nBrunswick River - Greater Bunbury \n</li>\n<li>\n\nCoblinine River &amp; Dorderyemunning Creek - Wagin Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nChapman River – Geraldton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDenmark River – Denmark Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGascoyne River - Carnarvon Townsite and the Lower Gascoyne.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGribble Creek - Kalgoorlie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHarding River - Roebourne Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nIrwin River - Dongara Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLower Collie River - Greater Bunbury.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Donnybrook Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSerpentine River, Peel, Birrega &amp; Oaklands Drains, Murray River and the Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary - Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Pinjarra and south to the Darling Scarp (Murray River) and Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Wellard (Peel Main Drain), east to South Western Highway (Serpentine River) and north to Wungong Brook (Birrega Drain).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Perth - Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River).

This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFlood fringe - the area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway where development could be permitted provided it is compatible with flood hazard and building conditions provide an adequate level of flood protection. These areas are generally covered by still or very slowly moving waters during a 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodway - the river channel and a portion of the floodplain where a significant flow or storage of water occurs during floods. If the floodway is even partially blocked, then the natural flooding regime of the area may be detrimentally impacted with flood levels being raised and affecting areas which may not have been previously affected. Development in floodways is to be avoided wherever possible.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

Prior to the commencement of this study it had been determined that the black bream was a suitable fish species for use as a biomonitoring tool when using mixed function oxygenase (MFO) activity induction under laboratory conditions. Biopsies taken from feral black bream collected from eight sites during the period 2000 to 2002 from the estuary confirmed that the use of MFO induction in this fish species as a biomarker of exposure to organic contaminants is a reliable biomarker.",

Having defined preferred and non-preferred terms within sport is intended to promote consistency in terminology across the entire sporting community. While at this stage it is called a Thesaurus, in the longer term it is hoped that the product becomes a sports metadata register for the purpose of creating data standards for data exchange and interoperability. \r\n\r\nThe _Australian Sports Thesaurus_ seeks to provide clarity and assistance to the sport community by:\r\n1. ensuring consistency of understanding and usage of sport terminology in documentary, legal and commercial discussions\r\n2. enabling improved system and database interoperability and reporting \r\n3. facilitating search and retrieval of information from sport information systems \r\n4. facilitating the defining of sport data for Data Dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThe terms and definitions are where relevant linked by the following relationships:\r\n+Preferred term\r\n+Non-preferred term\r\n+Broader term\r\n+Narrower term\r\n+Related term\r\n",

    "description": "This vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale.\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia.\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use.\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use.\nThis update refreshes the entire state of Western Australia to ALUM v8.",

    "description": "This data is Statistical Local Areas (SLA) based Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) - Is a continuum of advantage to disadvantage. Low values indicate areas of disadvantage; and high values indicate areas of advantage. This data is based on the 2006 census and follows the 2006 Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) boundaries.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has developed indexes to allow ranking of regions/areas, providing a method of determining the level of social and economic wellbeing in that region. There are four indexes included in the SEIFA 2006 product. They relate to socio-economic aspects of geographic areas. Each index summarises a different aspect of the socio-economic conditions in an area. The indexes have been obtained by a technique called principal components analysis. This technique summarises the information from a variety of social and economic variables, calculating weights that will give the best summary for the underlying variables. For the SEIFA indexes, each index uses a different set of underlying variables.\nAll the indexes (including the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage) have been constructed so that relatively disadvantaged areas (e.g. areas with many low income earners) have low index values.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 2033.0.55.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \nFor more information on this data please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Please note: \n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data following the 2006 ASGC.\n",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",
