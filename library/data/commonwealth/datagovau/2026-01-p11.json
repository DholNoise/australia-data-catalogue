    "title": "Eastwood & Terrys Creek Floodplain Risk Management Study & Plan Main Report",
    "description": "Reasons for the Study and Plan\n\nFlooding problems within the Eastwood town centre and other areas within the Terry’s Creek\ncatchment are well documented. Significant flooding problems have been experienced in\n1967, 1984 and 1989. It is estimated that over 70 houses or commercial properties\nexperienced above floor flooding in the November 1984 flood.\n\nA range of flood mitigation options were investigated some 17 years ago, in the Terry’s\nCreek Catchment Management Study that was prepared for the Water Board. Since that\ntime, there have been a number of other studies with an emphasis largely on structural\noptions, including tunnelling, as a means of reducing Eastwood’s flood problem. There have\nalso been various planning initiatives undertaken by Council which have imposed restrictions\non development because of the flood problems.\n\nIn May 2006, Bewsher Consulting was commissioned by the City of Ryde to assist its\nFloodplain Management Committee in preparing a Floodplain Management Study and Plan\nfor Eastwood and Terry’s Creek.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe prime responsibility for planning and management of flood prone lands in NSW rests\nwith local government. The NSW Government provides assistance on state-wide policy\nissues and technical support. Financial assistance is also provided to undertake flood and\nfloodplain risk management studies and for the implementation of works identified in any\nsubsequent floodplain risk management plan.\n\nThe Eastwood and Terry’s Creek Floodplain Management Committee oversaw the Study.\nThis committee includes Councillors and staff from the City of Ryde, and staff from\nParramatta City Council, Hornsby Shire Council, Department of Environment, Climate\nChange and Water (DECCW), Sydney Water Corporation and the State Emergency Service\n(SES). A number of community representatives were also represented on the committee.\n\nThe Study Area\n\nThe study area, shown on Figure 1, includes that portion of Terry’s Creek within the City of\nRyde, from Terry Road to the creek’s confluence with the Lane Cove River.\nThe Eastwood town centre is located within the study area, and straddles the Main Northern\nRailway Line. In addition to the main creek, the study area includes all significant tributaries\nand many overland flow paths.\n\nSome consideration has also been given to works that have previously been recommended\nwithin Parramatta City Council, where these works potentially impact on flooding within the\nCity of Ryde. The potential for flooding of properties in Parramatta City Council and Hornsby\nShire Council has also been considered immediately upstream and downstream of the\nrailway crossing.\n\nReporting\n\nThe Study results have been presented in a number of reports as the study has progressed,\nincluding reports covering:\n<ul>\n<li>the Flood Study (May 2008);</li>\n<li>Town Planning Considerations (July 2008); and the</li>\n<li>Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan (this report).</li>\n</ul>\n\nConsultation\nCommunity consultation has been an important component of the project. Key elements of\nthe consultation process have been as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>regular meetings of the Eastwood &amp; Terry’s Creek Floodplain Management\nCommittee;</li>\n<li>public review of the flood study results, including a public display during July and\nAugust 2007, an information day and feedback process; and</li>\n<li>public exhibition of the draft floodplain risk management study and plan, prior to formal\nconsideration by Council.</li>\n</ul>\n\nModelling of Flood Behaviour\n\nFlood behaviour has been assessed using computer models. The catchment area and\nstormwater pipe network within the study area was modelled using the DRAINS hydrologic\nmodel. Catchment flows from the Parramatta and Hornsby Council portion of the catchment\nwere generated using a less detailed RAFTS model. Flows from these models were input to\na two dimensional TUFLOW hydraulic model to estimate flood depths and the extent of flood\ninundation.\n\nThe flood models were calibrated to the November 1984 flood. They were then used to\nsimulate flood behaviour for a range of flood events, including a 5 year, 10 year, 20 year, 50\nyear, 100 year and Probable Maximum Flood (PMF).\n\nFlood Risk Mapping &amp; Development Controls\n\nThe area subject to flooding (up to the PMF) has been divided into three flood risk precincts\n(high, medium and low). Different development controls are proposed for the catchment,\ndepending on the type of development and the flood risk precinct in which the development\nis located. The flood risk precincts comprise:\n<ul>\n<li>The high flood risk area – where high flood damages, potential risk to life, or\nevacuation problems are anticipated. It is recommended that most development is\nrestricted within this area.</li>\n<li>The medium flood risk area – where there is still a significant risk of flood damage, but\nwhere these damages can be minimised by the application of appropriate\ndevelopment controls.</li>\n<li>The low flood risk area – where the risk of flood damage is low. Most land uses would\nbe permitted within this area (subject to other planning considerations).\nIn addition to the flood risk precincts, an overland flow precinct has also been defined. This\ncomprises shallow areas of inundation distant from major watercourses where less\nrestrictive flood level and other controls apply.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Flood Problem\n\nA flood damages database has been prepared for the study area to quantify the flood\nproblem and to assist in evaluating the economic merit of a range of flood mitigation\nmeasures.\n\nThe database includes details on 1,361 properties throughout the study area that could\npotentially be affected by flooding (up to a PMF flood). The database has further been\ndivided into 9 geographical areas (shown on Figure 1) to help identify the spatial distribution\nof the flood problem over the study area.\n\nFlood Mitigation Options Investigated\n\nA total of 12 options were identified by the floodplain management committee for analysis.\nThese options were initially assessed using performance in the 100 year flood and\nconsideration of environmental and other factors. A short list of 6 options was identified for\nfurther economic assessment. An additional option for the Eastwood town centre was also\ninvestigated following the evaluation of these options. The options are shown in Table 3.\n\nThe short tunnel option looked at diverting flow from upstream of Terry Road through a 3.8m\ndiameter tunnel direct to a small basin in the lower part of Eastwood Park. The main\nobjective was to reduce the flow carried by Terry’s Creek through the town centre. This\noption reduces flood levels through the town centre by 0.4 to 0.6m in a 100 year flood, and\nreduces the present value of all flood damage by $3.2M. However, flood levels downstream\nof the railway line increase marginally due to reduced travel times and results in an increase\nin flood damage of $0.4M. The net benefit is $2.8M and the estimated cost is $13M. This\noption is not favoured due to its poor benefit/cost ratio of 0.2 and the increase in\ndownstream flood levels.\n\nThe basin at Mobbs Lane and the culvert upgrade at Terry Road are two options that have\nbeen proposed in a report prepared for Parramatta City Council. Both options have been\nreviewed due to their potential impact on flood behaviour through the current study area.\n\nThe basin is likely to reduce flood levels whilst the culvert upgrade could potentially increase\nflood levels. Model results indicate a reduction in flood levels of 0.1 to 0.2m through\nEastwood in a 100 year flood due to the combined measures, but an increase of around\n0.1m in more frequent floods (5 year and 10 year events). This is due to the basin becoming\nless effective in smaller floods whilst the impact of the culvert upgrade became more\npronounced. It is recommended that a basin at Mobbs Lane be pursued with Parramatta City\nCouncil, with possible cost sharing arrangements between both Councils and the DECCW.\n\nAmplification of the Terry Road culvert can not be recommended without further\nconsideration of the impacts in smaller floods.\n\nDrainage improvements were investigated along Abuklea Road and in the vicinity of the TG\nMilner Sportsground. The initial scheme included doubling the size of the existing drainage\npipeline behind properties in Abuklea Road, but provided limited benefits. Further\nstormwater drainage improvements have been proposed for this area (see Table 4 for\npotential drainage improvements in this area and others).\n\nDebris control measures to prevent blockage of the railway culvert and the Progress Avenue\nculverts were investigated. The present value of all flood damage could be reduced by\napproximately $0.5M if the potential for blockage of these structures is eliminated. The\nmeasures are envisaged to incorporate bollards around the perimeter of the railway culvert, and structural fencing along the boundary of the open channel upstream of the Progress\nAvenue culverts. This measure has an estimated cost of the order of $50,000 and a\nbenefit/cost ratio considerably greater than 1.0. These works are recommended.\nThe final stage of a drainage augmentation scheme at First Avenue in the eastern town\ncentre was included in the flood model. Results indicated that flooding of a number of\ncommercial properties along Rowe Street could be alleviated by these works, with the\npresent value of all flood damages reduced by approximately $0.6M. The cost of the final\nstage of works has been estimated at $1.3M, which provides a benefit/cost ratio of 0.5. As\nthis is the final stage of a major drainage augmentation scheme, completion of this final\nstage is recommended.\n\nThe options recommended above only partially reduce flooding through the Eastwood town\ncentre. Further evaluation of drainage augmentation measures in this area was\nsubsequently undertaken. A scheme was identified including:\n<ul>\n<li>modification of the existing drain upstream of Progress Avenue, including the option to\ncover this drain;</li>\n<li>new twin box culverts from Glen Street Reserve to Eastwood Park, under Lakeside\nRoad; and</li>\n<li>an inlet headwall in Glen Street Reserve.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe drainage augmentation measures reduce the 100 year flood by up to 1.0 to 1.1m\nthrough the town centre, reducing the depth of flooding to less than 0.3m. The estimated\ncost is $8.5M, and the present value of flood benefits estimated at $4.6M. This provides a\nbenefit/cost ratio of 0.5, which is a substantial improvement over the other tunnel options\ninvestigated. Given the reduced risk to personal safety this option could be considered more\nfavourably. It would also remove many of the flooding constraints on future redevelopment of\nthe town centre. The option has been included in the recommended Floodplain Management\nPlan.\n\nStormwater Drainage Problems\n\nA large focus of the current study has been based on addressing the flood problems in the\nEastwood town centre. However, the total flood damage from this area represents only 30%\nof the flood damage experienced throughout the wider study area (based on the present\nvalue of flood damage in Table 2). Most of the other flooding problems are related to\nstormwater drainage and overland flow problems along the tributaries that lead to Terry’s\nCreek.\nThe majority of flooding problems are related to surface flows that are less than 0.5m in\ndepth. Flood behaviour within these areas is very much influenced by local conditions,\nincluding fences, structures, the accuracy of the ALS survey, and assumed floor levels of\npotentially affected buildings. Further investigations will be required in several areas to\ndetermine the most appropriate stormwater drainage improvements.\nTable 4 lists some provisional stormwater drainage improvement measures. These works\nare subject to detailed assessments, but are anticipated to include:\n<ul>\n<li>formalisation of overland flow paths;</li>\n<li>amplification of stormwater pipe lines; and</li>\n<li>potential relocation of buildings that currently restrict overland flow paths.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAdditional measures have been recommended for Area 7, including additional inlet pits in\nBrabyn Street, improvements to the culvert in Jim Walsh Park, and a feasibility study into a\npotential detention basin in Jim Walsh Park.\n\nPlanning Issues\n\nExisting planning controls related to flooding have been reviewed during the course of these\ninvestigations.\n\nA number of flood related controls have been proposed for the study area, which would be\nimplemented through a flood risk management chapter to be included in the City-wide DCP.\n\nThe DCP chapter outlines a common preamble, principles and objectives that would apply to\nall catchments within the City of Ryde. Specific controls for Eastwood and Terry’s Creek, as\ndetermined during the course of the floodplain management study, are included in a matrix\nof prescriptive controls (included as Figure 2). Other matrices would be developed and\nappended to the DCP chapter as studies and plans on other catchments are completed.\n\nMany of the measures included in the proposed DCP chapter formalise procedures that are\ncurrently applied by officers from Council. Some changes that have been recommended\ninclude:\n<ul>\n<li>increase of freeboard from 0.3m to 0.5m (except in the overland flow precinct);</li>\n<li>limited controls on residential development above the 100 year flood, to satisfy\nfreeboard allowance and vertical evacuation requirements;</li>\n<li>more comprehensive car parking and driveway access requirements;</li>\n<li>varying controls based on sensitivity of landuse to flood risk;</li>\n<li>providing concessions to encourage existing floodprone properties to redevelop in a\nflood-sensitive manner.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe study has also recognised that there may be locations beyond the limit of the 100 year\nflood (plus freeboard) where controls on residential development may be required in some\nrare circumstances (eg basement carparks, vertical evacuation). In accordance with the\nDepartment of Planning’s January 2007 Guideline, Council will need to seek approval from\nthe State Government to impose controls in this area.\n\nThe Recommended Floodplain Management Measures\n\nThe draft Eastwood and Terry’s Creek Floodplain Risk Management Plan is shown on\nFigure 3 and summarised in Table 5.\n\nIt is important to note that not all flooding problems in the study area have been alleviated. A\ncomplete solution to the flooding problem is not cost effective from a floodplain management\nperspective. However, problems can be reduced gradually over time as sensible\nredevelopment occurs. There may also be some scope to completely alter the drainage\nregime through the town centre in association with major redevelopment proposals.\n\nTiming and Funding\n\nThe total cost of implementing all the recommended measures is approximately $14.4M.\n\nThis includes an amount of $8.5M for drainage augmentation measures through the town\ncentre. It is envisaged that the Plan would be implemented progressively over a 5 to 10 year\ntime frame.\n\nThe timing of the proposed works will depend on the overall budgetary commitments of\nCouncil and the availability of funds from other sources (eg State Government, potential\nSection 94 contributions, private sector contributions etc).",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The commissioning of new dedicated FRB detection systems has led to an exponential increase in the detected FRBs over the last decade. Despite &gt;700 FRBs published to date, there is still a lack of understanding about the physical mechanisms through which FRB emission is produced. Due to the possibility of detecting multiple bursts from the same source in a repeating FRB, it forms an ideal sample set to uncover the physics of the source (e.g., emission mechanism, progenitor surrounding media), and test possible progenitor models. The coherent upgrade to the FRB detection system to ASKAP is expected to detect ~1-2 FRB/week. However, due to the limited fractional bandwidth available with ASKAP and survey nature of the telescope, probing the spectro-polarimetric characteristics of repeating sources is non-optimal. Hence, the large bandwidth offered by the ultra wideband-low (UWL) on Parkes/Murriyang is an ideal instrument to follow-up repeating FRB sources discovered through CRACO. Over the next ~6 months, we expect to double the number of repeaters that have been studied through the UWL. This will provide unprecedented insight into the progenitor environment and the surrounding media of repeating FRBs. We propose using the UWL to follow up repeater-like sources to study their wideband spectro-polarimetric characteristics.",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) R.V. Tangaroa collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during its voyages in Sub-Antarctic. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to New Zealand daily. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

    "description": "The Climate Science Initiative (CSI) State temperature projection 20km bias corrected dataset has been produced as part of the Climate Science Initiative program. This dataset contains minimum temperature projections.\n\nClimate projection data is available at a 20-kilometre resolution representing the monthly average of daily minimum near-surface air temperature (at 2m) for annual and seasonal time slices (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) over 5 time periods including:\n\n•   Baseline (1990-2009)\n\n•   2030 (2020-2039)\n\n•   2050 (2040-2059)\n\n•   2070 (2060-2079)\n\n•   2090 (2080-2099)\n\nProjections represent two emissions scenarios, SSP1-2.6 (a ‘low’ emissions scenario) and SSP3-7.0 (a ‘high’ emissions scenario). The results are presented as a mean, minimum and maximum result of the NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) ensemble (representing 10 Global Climate Model results) for each gridded point, as well as a standard deviation to reveal the statistical range between model results.\n\nRelative change files (difference between the future and baseline prediction) are also available for each of the calculations i.e. annual and seasonal mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum. \nThe data is bias corrected, and users are encouraged to read the CSI technical fact sheet for further information on this, and data limitations. It also includes background information on the project and datasets, explanations of technical terms such as Global Climate Models (GCMs), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and further information about the projections. It also contains important advice regarding using the data appropriately.  \n\nFuture updates to this dataset may include regional and global climate model specific data at a 4-kilometre resolution, as well as a third ‘middle of the road’ scenario (SSP2-4.5). \n\nThe data naming protocol is outlined in the technical information factsheet available under Data and Resources. \n\n•   Frequently asked questions - https://www.wa.gov.au/service/environment/environment-information-services/climate-science-initiative-frequently-asked-questions\n\n•   Climate Science Initiative - https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-water-and-environmental-regulation/climate-science-initiative",

The Albury FMP deals with the city as a whole.",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Rail Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2021",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nInterpretation of data on maps 522 and 528 and AusAEM maps. Within the Beetaloo GBA region, areas with higher potential for recharge to the Cambrian Limestone aquifer are those with the following conditions: A. Carpentaria Basin cover is thin, B. Carpentaria B sequence consists primarily of Carpentaria A sandstone, and C. there are areas with sinkholes at surface and other collapse features. These conditions are met in NW corner of Beetaloo GBA region. Areas with potential for recharge to Carpentaria Basin A sandstone aquifer, may occur where the Carpentaria Basin sandstone is partially saturated. Indirectly this may be a source of recharge to the underlying CLA as well. This area occurs in southern parts of the Beetaloo GBA region, where the Caprentaria sandstone is utilised as an aquifer.The rest of the  eastern Beetaloo probably has lower potential for recharge as Carpentaria Basin sediments tend to be dominated by clay and black shale, and can be very thick.  These areas need to be double checked against longterm water level data to confirm if any recharge is occurring.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nProduced by interpreting Caprentaria thickness and sinkhole maps (see factsheet 5 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba for more  details).

This dataset was also supplied to the Air Pollution Group as part of a study examining the possible health problems associated with the future environmental air quality conditions. The CCAM model was nested in the CSIRO Mk3.0 Global Climate model (GCM) host for the A2 scenario with the M20th scenario as greenhouse emissions corresponding to 1961-2000. 4X-Daily, Monthly mean and seasonal atmospheric variables are available between Lat: 15, -50 &amp; Lon: 70, 200 at 6 levels (1000, 850, 700, 500, 300, 200 hPa) with .5º (60km) resolution. There are 1687 daily files totalling 2.39 TB, and 3122 monthly_mean &amp; seasonal files totaling 94.3 GB.

A synthesis of historical data sets for primary producers, sessile and mobile invertebrates and finfish were collected from the indicators region and an extensive review of potential indicators for finfish was also conducted (available for download from this metadata record).  \n\nA program to monitor the health and biodiversity of subtidal reefs was established in April 2010 and April 2011. An Automated Underwater Vehicle (AUV) was deployed at the Abrolhos Islands, Jurien Bay and Rottnest Island to capture valuable information on the cover and abundance of benthic invertebrates and macroalgae. Replicate grids (25 x 25 m area of seabed) were surveyed.  Exact co-ordinates are given below.",

    "description": "Traditional pulsar searching techniques are not sensitive enough to extreme pulsars such as millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in compact binaries (e.g., Pulsar-Blackhole binary systems), extremely fast spinning pulsars (e.g., sub-MSPs), and high dispersion measure (DM) pulsars. Such a situation is now changed thanks to the development of next generation radio telescope arrays such as Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). ASKAP is capable of conducting highly sensitive radio continuum surveys with wide sky coverage (e.g, Evolutionary Map of The Universe survey). One of the solutions is to find pulsar candidates in radio continuum surveys such as ASKAP surveys and then carry out targeted searches. This technique allows us to search over the wide bandwidth with full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. In this proposal, we propose to observe 16 pulsar candidates identified in the Galactic plane using new ASKAP EMU images. We found 22 candidates by selecting sources with spectral index steeper than -2.0 and compactness less than 1.2. Among them 13 are known pulsars and a reasonable number of candidates to follow up (9 sources). In total, we have 16 candidates including seven sources from 2023APRS semester. Because of the dense ionised medium in the Galactic Plane, MSPs are likely to be missed by previous pulsar surveys carried out at 1.4 GHz. Here, we propose a targeted pulsar search with the Parkes UWL which allow us to search pulsation at higher frequencies and therefore avoid strong DM smearing and scattering effects.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

The criteria for describing habitat critical to the survival of a species for marine turtles was determined in accordance with the EPBC Act Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 - Matters of National Environmental Significance. The guidelines define 'habitat critical to the survival of a species' as areas necessary:\n• activities such as foraging, breeding or dispersal\n• for the long-term maintenance of the species (including the maintenance of species essential to the survival of the species)\n• to maintain genetic diversity and long term evolutionary development\n• for the reintroduction of populations or recovery of the species.\n\nThe mapped areas were identified by consensus of a panel of experts in marine turtle biology.Data is licenced under the department's restrictive Data Licence Deed\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018\nData is in draft format only\nDepartmental Deed\nData is licenced under the department's restrictive Data Licence Deed\n",

Data has been collected using a standard monitoring protocol outlined in 'Assessing estuary ecosystem health: Sampling, data analysis and reporting protocols. NSW Natural Resources Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Program', most recently updated in 2016 and available on the NSW environment website. The data has been used to monitor the aquatic ecosystem condition of over 160 estuaries in NSW over time. Adopting the principles of the National Water Quality Management Framework, the data has been used to develop NSW specific guideline values for a range of physico-chemical water quality indicators for each estuary type. This allows comparison of observed data to these guidelines to assess condition of any estuary in NSW. As part of the Marine Estate Management Strategy Implementation Plan Stage 1, a NSW water quality database has been developed, where this data is now stored. Water quality monitoring in NSW estuaries is ongoing, and updated data will be made available routinely.",

It has been derived from data published in the Australian National Tide Tables.\n\nCAMRIS, standing for the Coastal and Marine Resources Information System, is a small-scale spatial analysis system developed in collaboration by several divisions of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), as part of the CSIRO Coastal Zone Program.  CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology is the custodian of the 'coastal' subset of the Australian Resources Information System (ARIS).  Coastal ARIS became the core dataset of the CAMRIS project.  The Coastal ARIS database was developed from a coastal inventory developed by Galloway et al.  This inventory contained relatively large scale data including landform, geology, vegetation, soil, land use, climate and population information for each of 3027 3x10km sections around the coastline of mainland Australia and Tasmania, but excluding offshore islands.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.

The dataset was derived using a set of decision rules developed by the Eden Wilderness Panel and refined by the Environment and Heritage Technical Committee.\n\nThe delineated wilderness dataset was used in negotiations for the North East NSW Regional Forest Agreement to fulfil nationally-agreed criteria (JANIS, 1997). The dataset was also used by the NSW Government in a subsequent process for assessment under the NSW Wilderness Act 1987 (EA, 1999).\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth Government and NSW Governments under the NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Data Agreement of 31 March 2000.This data is available to the public from the Department and may be used by third parties for unrestricted use provided that the copyright interests of the owners are protected.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and New South Wales Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "    \n\nRelative Yield From Salinity in 2020 (%) dataset is one of 11 national\nsurfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic opportunities\nassociated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in 1996/97\nAustralian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a11.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nThis digital soil landscape product contains natural resource mapping for the Australian Capital Territory. The project was completed by the Office of Environment and Heritage (NSW). The project was funded by the ACT Government to enhance knowledge of soils, landscapes and physical constraints to land use in the urban and rural environment. The information will assist in informed decision making, planning and environmental modelling throughout the catchment.\n55 soil landscape map units have been described for the ACT. Each unit is an inventory of soil and landscape information with relatively uniform land management requirements, allowing major soil and landscape qualities and constraints to be identified.\nThe GIS product shown here provides location of each of the soil landscape map units - including the soil landscape code and name. For more detailed information please see the full soil landscape reports for each unit, as well as the final report (see datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au). Detailed spreadsheets can be used to join more detailed information to the GIS also available on request.\nLineage:\nThe mapping undertaken by the NSW Government was created using:<ul><li>\nexisting published soil landscape mapping (Canberra and Michelago 1:100,000 map sheets);</li><li>\nnew soil landscape mapping (part Brindabella and Tantangara 1:100,000 map sheets).</li></ul>\nFor all datasets, provisional soil landscapes were established firstly on the dominant geomorphic processes responsible for the formation of the landscape and secondly on the geological parent material. Elevation, aspect, vegetation patterns and human disturbance were other factors considered when defining units. \nFor existing mapping, the boundaries of these provisional soil landscapes were mapped using stereoscopic interpretation of 1:40,000 scale black and white and 1:25,000 scale colour aerial photographs (Canberra) and 1:40,000 scale black and white aerial photographs only for Michelago. LANDSAT thematic mapper and radiometric imagery were used to assist with perception and charting of provisional soil landscapes. These boundaries were transferred onto 1:25 000 topographic base maps. After field checking boundaries and detailed investigations of the soil, the provisional landscapes were confirmed, amalgamated or sub-divided.\nFor new mapping on the Brindabella and Tantangara sheets, the boundaries were captured by digitizing directly to screen at around 1:10,000 scale using ArcGIS. Ultra-high resolution (10 cm) aerial photographic imagery provided a base layer during the capture process. In addition the following data were used to assist delineate soil landscapes boundaries: ADS digital aerial imagery, radiometric imagery, SPOT 5 satellite imagery, climate data, 1 second DSM and DEM elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 1:100,000 scale geological mapping, 1:25,000 topographic maps and DTDB digital terrain models.\nSoils have been examined and described in detail at over 500 sites in the ACT. This includes 79 new detailed sites to fill data gaps for this project. At each site, soil morphological data and site information were recorded on Soil and Land Information System (SALIS) cards or digitally collected via the eDIRT field data collection system. Sufficient field work was undertaken within each soil landscape to identify the range of soils present and to enable their distribution within the landscape to be described. To best knowledge none of the sites were randomly sampled. Sample intervals were selected to be morphologically representative examples of each soil material present in each type profile i.e. soil horizons.\nA comprehensive suite of soil tests have been analysed for many of the representative type soil profiles within the ACT.\nA desktop review of published soil landscape units has occurred resulting in some minor amendments to the existing linework.\nPositional Accuracy:\nObservations and soil profiles were located using handheld GPS or using 1:25,000 topographic maps. Soil boundaries on this 1:100,000 scale map product is generally accurate to within 100 m on the ground but variations will occur especially where soil boundaries are gradual. The scale of use of this dataset is 1:100,000.\nAttribute Accuracy:\nSoil landscape map units are defined by unique combinations of soil type, topography, geology, native vegetation, land use, existing erosion/land degradation and constraints to development. The land and soil attributes in this product were mainly assessed using field observations, remote sensing interpretation (satellite, radiometric and aerial photos) and laboratory analysis of dominant soil type profiles.\nLogical Consistency:\nMap unit concepts and polygons, major soil types and soil landscape descriptions have been field verified by a peer soil scientist for many map units especially in published mapping areas and accessible terrain. All units have some level of field investigation and checking. ArcGIS was used to ensure all polygons in the shape file are topologically correct. All polygons have a unique identifier.\nCompleteness:\nAll polygons in the GIS layer are labeled with a soil landscape MasterCode and MasterName. PDF reports and spreadsheet data have been supplied for each map unit.\nAdditional Metadata:\nSoil Landscape of the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12</a>\nSoil Landscape of the Canberra 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf</a>\nSoil Landscapes of the Australian Capital Territory project report:\nCook, W., Jenkins, B., Young, M., Murphy, C., Milford H.B. and Muller, R.

Important information in the spatial feature class includes the dataset spatial extent (i.e. its \"footprint\") and dataset number and the state of origin of the underlying dataset. Where more than one dataset have been combined within a footprint, the polygons from each data source are represented separately (particularly in NSW and NT); however, \"veg clearing\" datasets have not been included directly, to keep the number of polygons manageable. See the real NVIS vector or raster data for such data.\n\nImportant information in the associated lookup table (NVIS5_1_LUT_KEY_DSETn, where n is an incremental number for minor updates) joined via DATA_SET_NUMBER includes data source (e.g. State and Territory NVIS or gap-fill), dataset name, publication scale and the on-ground range of dates of the vegetation survey.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 12 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

Datapoints with charge balance error above 10% have been removed prior to interpretation.

MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.Restricted\nRestricted\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\nUsers must attribute the Department as the data provider.",

    "title": "Future scenarios for the southern Murray-Darling Basin water market",
    "description": "Since the peak of the Millennium drought, the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) has seen large increases in nut and cotton plantings, decreases in water supply due to environmental water recovery and tighter limits on water trade between regions. These changes have raised concerns about how the water market might cope under drought conditions. \r\n\r\n In this study, ABARES applies an economic model of the sMDB to simulate what would happen to the water market under a repeat of the Millennium drought, with current water demand, environmental water recovery, trade limits and carryover rules. These scenarios provide an indication of future water prices and trade patterns across the sMDB under a repeat of historical climate conditions (for the period 2002-03 to 2016-17). \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n• Modelling results suggest that under a repeat of historical conditions allocation water prices in the sMDB would rise no higher than the peaks observed during the previous drought. \r\n• Whilst demand for water has increased for cotton and almonds, this has been more than offset by reductions in demand in other industries particularly, grazing, dairy and rice. \r\n• Improvements in carryover rules will help to limit price rises under a repeat of the drought, with much larger volumes of water being stored between years. \r\n• Trade limits will likely be binding more often in the future, partly due to the changes in water demand. \r\n• While water price peaks are simulated to be no higher under a repeat of extreme drought conditions, they are higher on average, due in part to environmental water recovery. The modelling suggests a change in the distribution of prices, with fewer years of low prices.\r\n",

    "description": "The ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_R line features represent the set of river reaches that are assessed in the 2010 ISC. The line features represents the middle of the river channel and have been defined as the midpoint of the ISC2010_STREAMBED_WIDTH polygon feature.  This data set represents a re-alignment of the ISC2004 River Reaches. River centre lines have been connected at Reach ends and flow direction has been enforced. Each Reach has Metric Statistics assessed and recorded in Reach Summary (_R) Tabes. \n\nThe ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_R is designed to JOIN to all ISC2010__R tables.\n\nThe ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_REACH acts as the spatial key to which all other Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation reach metric statistics can be linked.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of general practitioner (GP) attendances and associated Medicare benefits expenditure per person. GP attendance has been calculated with the total services from eligible claims (excluding any bulk-billed incentive items or other top-up items), divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as at 30 June 2016. GP expenditure has been calculated with the total benefit paid for eligible claims, divided by the ERP as at 30 June 2016. The data spans the financial years of 2010-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nGP after-hours attendances are Medicare benefit-funded after-hours patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. They include urgent and non-urgent attendances.\n\n\nExpenditure on GP/specialist attendances comprises MBS funding for patient/doctor encounters. Expenditure is reported unadjusted for inflation.\n\n\nBulk-billing is an arrangement in which a medical practitioner sends the bill directly to Medicare, so the patient pays nothing. Also known as direct billing.\n\n\nAge-standardisation allows fairer comparisons to be made between areas by accounting for variation in the age of populations within each area. This adjustment is important because the rates of many health conditions and health service use vary with age.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\n<strong>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</strong>\nRiver and Creek Flooding\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside.&nbsp;\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i>&nbsp;Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions&nbsp;- with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage.&nbsp;\n<i>Purpose</i>:&nbsp;To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure&nbsp;with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach&nbsp;based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations.&nbsp;<i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i>&nbsp;\n<i>Flood Height:&nbsp;</i>Indicates the approximate water surface level of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event, expressed in metres above mean sea level. This dataset represents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of 0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i>&nbsp;The dataset includes three possible flood events of different probability.\n<i>Likelihood: Likely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood:&nbsp;Possible</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):&nbsp;1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):&nbsp;100 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood: Unlikely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year</i>\n<i>Version Notes&nbsp;3.1.0</i>&nbsp;- First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE.

Model does not include underground structures however rainfall was scaled down to account for the possibility of some run-off being contained within the underground system. A post-process was applied to eliminate areas of shallow depth, low velocity and low velocity depth product. Additional removal of model errors and small property intersects using spatial analysis and manual techniques.<i>Existing Conditions Scenario:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Modelled estimate of the extent of overland flow paths following a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability storm outside the river and creek flood extent and with some model errors and small property intersects removed.<i>Purpose:</i>&nbsp;To determine flood extent along overland flowpaths in areas outside the extent of the river and creek flood modelling. Suitable for public dissemination.<i>Flood Extent:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indicates the approximate extent of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event (not actual recorded levels). The inundation area may be less accurate where the property is flat near the outer limit of inundation, or where the ground surface has been modified since being surveyed.This dataset represents the flood extent as vector polygons without attribution.<i>Modelled Probability:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is:&nbsp;1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year<i>Likelihood:</i>&nbsp;Possible<i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):</i>&nbsp;1%<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):</i>&nbsp;100 YearA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but neverthess still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.<i>Version Notes&nbsp;1.25.0 - Sub set of F01 Version 1.24 with areas removed where field Public = N in F00N Version 1.18.8 (April 2025)</i><i>Version Resolution: 1.0m</i><i>Data Reliability: D</i><i>Indicates that Council can only provide an extent but not levels as the flood data is of limited reliability</i>\n<i><strong>Further Information</strong></i><i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website </i><a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">Flood information for residents of Moreton Bay - City of Moreton Bay</a>",

    "description": "This data set includes population and electronic gaming machine (EGM) expenditure breakdowns by local government area (LGA) and gaming venue, demographic statistics, labour statistics and Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) LGA score and ranking per LGA for the 2015/16 financial year. The data has been joined with LGA 2011 boundaries. \nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nEGM Numbers: a venue may be operating less machines than its licensed or attached numbers\n\n\nGaming Machine Density calculations are based on operating gaming machines with attached entitlements divided by adult population divided by 1,000 (gaming machines per 1,000 adults).\n\n\nExpenditure / EGM: Refers to the average Expenditure per Gaming Machine. In 2013, these figures are based on net expenditures divided by number of gaming machines with attached entitlements.\n\n\nSEIFA Scores: a lower score indicates that an area is relatively disadvantaged compared to an area with a higher score. Scores should only be used in distributive analysis. Rankings are based on highest score, for example 1st ranking in index of disadvantage means the LGA is least disadvantaged.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Care must be taken in using any figures for an LGA involving net expenditure and population. The expenditure per person in an LGA may include an amount of expenditure coming from persons not living within the LGA.\n\n",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "title": "Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 16 September 2015",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis V7 database has been updated to include the Receptor data from Clarence-Moreton assessment team. The relevant tables of ReceptorList and tbl_Receptors and the spatial data of  GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt  were added to this version. The Clarence-Moreton Asset database v7 supersedes the previous version of the Asset database only in Receptor relevant tables/ feature class (i.e. ReceptorList, tbl_Receptors and GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt ).\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v7  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150916.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150916_GISOnly.gdb), the draft Receptor Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-140-ReceptorRegister-V20150916.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.

    "description": "The purpose of the experiment was to quantitatively examine the colour changes associated with moulting in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin between Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nCircular cages were constructed on the mud flat and characteristically marked crabs were introduced. In total 11 females and 10 males were photographed through at least one moult.\n\nOn average, U. capricornis grow 1.6mm with every moult. With every successive moult the carapace pattern contracts and becomes more distinct, especially in males. In addition to the considerable variation in pattern, both sexes also vary in the specific colour of their spots. Colour changes are associated with moulting and, as with pattern, tend to follow a certain progression.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis data set comprises the  inputs, parameters and outputs of the OGIA groundwater models as used for BA groundwater modelling reported in the product 2.6.2 of Maranoa-Balonne-Condamine subregion. Only one input file (MODFLOW drain package input file) was modified for the BA specific model runs. This input file is provided within the folder named NIC_MBC_Model_Input_files. All other model inputs are the same as is used in the OGIA model runs for Underground water Impact Report 2012. These inputs may be requested from Office of Groundwater Impact Assessment and is not published in the BA repository as per the agreement with OGIA.\n\nThe OGIA drain package has been modified to include the boundary conditions caused by 7 mines in the MBC subregion. For this  a python script was written. The script reads the original drain package file (ASCII file) of OGIA model and then write additional drain cells to the file at the locations of the 7 mines - Commodore, newAcland stage 2, Wilkie Creek, Kogan Creek, Cameby Downs, New Acland stage 3 and The Range. The script reads the locations of these mines from input files - .dat  (to the script) with names similar to the mine names. The locations of the mines are specified as rows and columns of the model grid in these input files. These files also have the elevations of the drain cells (bottom/centre of the cells in the Walloon Coal Measures in which the coal mine pit is present). The location and elevation data were obtained from OGIA  and is registered as a separate data set. \n\nTwo copies of the  python script are present in the folder corresponding to the baseline and CRDP drain packages.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nAll the model input data files were obtained from OGIA with the condition that these will not be published. The drain package input file and all output files were generated by CSIRO Land and Water by using CSIRO generated scripts and by running the model using these inputs. The drain package has inputs from the original OGIA model drain pakcage and additional data obtained from OGIA and coal mine footprint data. \n\n\n\nThe coal mine footprint data sets is registered as a separate data set. The OGIA model is not registered as a separate source data set as it is not publishable as per the agreement.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) MBC Groundwater model.

    "description": "####_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._####\r\n\r\n### Background ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information. \r\n\r\n### 2020 AIS data ###\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2020 AIS information lodged by multiple charities. \r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2020 AIS data. This report - the 8th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on [our website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/tools/reports/australian-charities-report-8th-edition).\r\n\r\n### Interpreting AIS data ###\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au).\r\n\r\n### Withheld information ###\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n### More ACNC data ###\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. \r\n",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and covers the northern part of the suburb of Chester\nHill. It is an urban catchment that drains through a stormwater pipe network in a north-easterly\ndirection to the Parramatta Council Local Government Area (LGA). The Wolumba catchment is one\nof the sub catchments of Duck River, and is wholly within the north western section of Bankstown City\nCouncil (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 160 stormwater pits and 220 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Wolumba Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix B.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix B.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the current Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of national land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for application to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature conservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved tenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series. Further information can be found on the Forests Australia website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/",

Photopoints were taken annually using the five point photopoint method. The set of images for each year usually consists of twenty images: four images taken at each corner of the plot facing each of the four cardinal points, and four images taken from the center of the plot facing each corner. \n\nThe Karawatha Peri-Urban Site was established in 2007 and decommissioned in 2018. The site was located in Eucalypt forest at Karawatha Forest. For additional site information, see https://deims.org/f15bc7aa-ab4a-443b-a935-dbad3e7101f4. \n\nOther images collected at the site include digital cover photography and ancillary images of fauna and flora.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. This pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 5. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors as well as a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "A survey of the east Tasmanian coastline from Musselroe Bay to South East Cape revealed a total of 10 km2 of Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh 1820 kelp forest. Average harvestable quantities based on Alginates (Australia) Company records (1965-72) show that cropping can expect to yield 5 ton/acre or 1.23 kg/m2. This realizes a total of 12,300 tonne available on the East Coast of Tasmania in 1986. Review of past records show fluctuations in total amounts harvested, due possibly to factors such as high oceanic water temperatures with subsequent low nutrient concentrations and storm damage.\nThe survey was conducted from a light aeroplane. Areas of Macrocystis pyrifera beds were marked on 1:100,000 topographical land tenure maps using landmarks as references. Digitising of bed outlines on maps was done using Mapinfo.\nWeight of Macrocystis per unit area is also estimated from quadrats harvested at a number of sites along the coast.",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nFreshwater basil aquifer data indicates the approximate boundary of the fresh water basal aquifer on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behaviour on the island.\nThe boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to a generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the freshwater basal aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection.   In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift. \nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Australian National Mooring Network Facility is a series of national reference stations and regional moorings designed to monitor particular oceanographic phenomena in Australian coastal ocean waters. \n\nThere are seven sub-facilities in the ANMN: four regional sub-facilities, a series of National Reference Stations (NRS), Acoustic Observatories and an Acidification Moorings sub-facility.\n\nThe ANMN sub-facilities are:\na) Queensland and Northern Australia\nb) New South Wales\nc) Southern Australia\nd) Western Australia\ne) Acoustic Observatories \nf) National Reference Stations (Coordination and Analysis)\ng) Acidification Moorings\n\nThe National Reference Stations were first established in the 1940’s and are the backbone component of the observing system.  Extended by IMOS from three to nine sites around the entire Australian continent, the stations report integrated biological, chemical and physical oceanography time series observations, upon which more intensive local and regional scale studies can be referenced against. The regional moorings monitor the interaction between boundary currents and shelf water masses and their consequent impact upon ocean productivity (e.g. Perth Canyon Upwelling; Kangaroo Island Upwelling) and ecosystem distribution and resilience (e.g. Coral Sea interaction with the Great Barrier Reef ). Operation of the network is distributed between several operators and coordinated nationally.\n\nPassive acoustic listening station arrays are located at three sites. These stations provide baseline data on ambient oceanic noise, detection of fish and mammal vocalizations and detection of underwater events. The Acidification Moorings are co-located at three of the National Reference Stations, and provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.",

    "description": "The Yongala acidification mooring is co-located with the Yongala National Reference Station (NRSYON) in Queensland. It was first deployed in 2011, but subsequently damaged by Tropical Cyclone Yasi in February 2011. It was replaced in September 2013.\n\nThe mooring's instruments measure surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. Current instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and a WETLabs WQM.\n\nThe Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification. The Yongala acidification moorings is located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean.",

The data spans the years 2013-2015 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC) and historical data for time trends. Where the term 'teenage mother' is used the analysis is based on women who gave birth aged under 20. Teenage mothers and their babies are more likely to experience broader disadvantage, have antenatal risk factors and have poorer maternal and baby outcomes during and after birth, than older mothers and their babies. \nThe Teenage Mothers in Australia data accompanies the Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nExcludes women not usually resident in Australia or whose usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

Previous observations of a few of these sources with the Parkes UWL receiver have proven its utility in follow-up timing observations of MeerKAT discoveries.\n  MeerKAT has discovered a few more RRATs in its latest observing cycle and more good quality UWL observations of these sources are required to determine the rotational period and period derivative and also to facilitate the study of their emission properties. Therefore, we request follow-up observations of 5 new sources to achieve this and to further enable spectral and polarization studies of these sources. Given the potential link between RRATs, magnetars, and some fast radio bursts (FRBs) suggested by both observations and theories, this study could reveal more similarities between these different classes of transient sources and significantly advance our understanding of their origins.",

    "description": "Purpose: Management of Groundwater resources in Western Australia.\n\nGroundwater Resources stored in WRIMS (Water Resource Information Management System). \n\nThe intersection of groundwater Subareas with Aquifer boundaries (usually) define groundwater Resources, \nwhich are the units used by the DWER to manage environmentally sustainable limits of extraction for \ngroundwater resources.\n\nFor the purposes of groundwater resource management, the state of Western Australia is divided into \ngroundwater areas proclaimed under the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act. These groundwater areas are\nfurther subdivided into groundwater subareas. The subareas are not proclaimed under the Rights in Water\nand Irrigation Act, but are administrative boundaries used to manage the extraction and licensing of \ngroundwater resources.\n\nGroundwater Resources in this dataset are not always the intersection of a Subarea with an Aquifer. \nAdditionally, the Groundwater Areas stored in WRIMS do not accurately reflect the official gazetted \nGroundwater Area boundaries. A program is currently underway (Sept 2005) to review both Groundwater \nResource and Groundwater area boundaries. Please contact the data steward for more information.",

It is important to note that Queensland Police Service offender statistics are based on offence counts and do not and cannot refer to individuals. Rather, offender data refers to the number of offences cleared or solved through an action against an offender. As such, offender data does not equate to a unique offender count nor does it equate to the number of offences cleared. Only persons ten years and over deemed to be offenders, Juvenile offenders are those aged between and including ten and sixteen years. Offenders have not been included if their age or gender is not specified in Queensland Police Service records.",
