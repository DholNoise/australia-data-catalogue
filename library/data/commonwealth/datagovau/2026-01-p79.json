    "description": "This resource contains geochemistry data for the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in the Timor Sea collected by Geoscience Australia during September and October 2012 on RV Solander (survey GA0339/SOL5650). This dataset comprises carbonate concentrations and specific surface area measurments on the upper 2 cm of seabed sediments. The Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve survey was undertaken as an activity within the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program Marine Biodiversity Hub and was the key component of Research Theme 4 - Regional Biodiversity Discovery to Support Marine Bioregional Plans. Hub partners involved in the survey included the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Geoscience Australia, the University of Western Australia, Museum Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Data acquired during the survey included: multibeam sonar bathymetry and acoustic backscatter; sub-bottom acoustic profiles; physical samples of seabed sediments, infauna and epibenthic biota; towed underwater video and still camera observations of seabed habitats; baited video observations of demersal and pelagic fish, and; oceanographic measurements of the water column from CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) casts and from deployment of sea surface drifters. Further information on the survey is available in the post-survey report published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L.,Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A. 2013.

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.5.0) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe site is situated within a wetland that flooded seasonally. The principal vegetation is <em>Oryza rufipogon</em>, <em>Pseudoraphis spinescens</em> and <em>Eleocharis dulcis</em>. The elevation is approximately 4&nbsp;m, with a neighbouring Bureau of Meteorology station recording 1411&nbsp;mm mean annual precipitation. Maximum temperatures range from 31.3&nbsp;°C (in June and July) to 35.6&nbsp;°C (in October), while minimum temperatures range from 14.9&nbsp;°C (in July) to 23.9&nbsp;°C (in December and February). Maximum temperatures vary on a seasonal basis by approximately 4.3&nbsp;°C and minimum temperatures by 9.0&nbsp;°C.\nThe instrument mast is 15&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry. Ancillary measurements being taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne-based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the site in September 2008.",

    "description": "Updated data for the Australian Government’s Income Management (IM) program will be available on the third Thursday of every month. The data summary will include: \r\n\r\nTable 1. Number of IM participants by location and measure \r\n\r\n1.1 Northern Territory\r\n \r\n1.2 Western Australia\r\n \r\n1.3 Queensland \r\n\r\n1.4 South Australia\r\n \r\n1.5 Victoria \r\n\r\n1.6 New South Wales\r\n \r\n\r\nTable 2. Number of IM participants with an active BasicsCard by State/Territory \r\n\r\nTable 3. Number of IM exemptions by Indigenous Indicator \r\n\r\nThe data provided will be the last weekly data update for the previous month. \r\n\r\n__Legislation__ \r\n\r\nLegislation for IM is located [here](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00580/latest/text) in the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_.\r\n\r\nThe Guide to Social Policy Law for IM is located [here](https://guides.dss.gov.au/guide-social-security-law/11).\r\n \r\n\r\n__Information about IM__ \r\n\r\nMore information about Income Management is located [here](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/income-management) on the Department of Human Services web site.\r\n\r\n\r\n__Locations__\r\n\r\nThe places that have IM, by State and Territory, is located [here](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/income-management/where-payments-are-income-managed) on the Department of Human Services web site. \r\n\r\n\r\n__Data Confidentialisation Policy__ \r\n\r\nTable cells are suppressed where the count refers to less than five, but more than zero, people. The method is: \r\n\r\n* Cells with counts between one (1) and four (4) are presented as <5. \r\n* Cells with counts between one (1) and four (4) are presented as <5.\r\n* Cells with a count of zero (0) are not suppressed. \r\n* Where suppression has been applied and it is still possible to derive the cell value from other information in the table, the total/s or the next lowest aggregate cells are suppressed and presented with ‘n.p.’ (not provided). \r\n\r\n__Data Caveats__\r\n\r\n1. Any variance from data reported prior to 28 August 2015 is due to a change to conform to the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \r\n2. Inconsistencies may be attributed to participants moving from the location where they were originally triggered onto the program. \r\n3. Participants with ‘Unknown’ locations did not have a recorded address at the time of data extraction. This often occurs because a participant is in the process of moving address. \r\n4. ‘Uncategorised CIM’ customers are instances where a customer was assessed for Income Management but was never switched ON and assigned a Category Code. \r\n5. ‘Greater Brisbane’ includes ‘Logan’. \r\n6. ‘Far North’ includes ‘Cape York’. \r\n7. For ‘Current Income Management Exemptions by Indigenous Indicator’, automatic exemptions for <25% of Max Payment is not included.",

Derwent Beach Watch is a collaborative program between councils and state government that tests water quality at 18 swimming sites around the estuary during summer months. \nWater samples are collected each Tuesday from the start of December to the end of March and analysed for the faecal indicator bacteria Enterococci (Enteralert method) at the Public health Lab. Because the samples must be cultured, it takes several days to publish the results.",

The other two are the 1:500 000 State Cenozoic geology and the 1:500 000 State linear structures layer (DMIRS-015).\nCompilation is based on published 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 Geological Series maps of Western Australia, together with GSWA and GA (AGSO, BMR) regional geological maps at scales from 1:250 000 to 1:1 000 000. Information from these maps has been modified locally using geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and unpublished geological mapping. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the lithostratigraphic units are based on the GSWA Explanatory Notes System (extracted April 2016). Data are held in GDA94 decimal degrees.\n\nThis dataset was formally known as 1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology (DMP-013)",

Landfills can cause contamination, but once a landfill is closed, operators are obliged to rehabilitate and manage their sites. Even when closed, careful management of sites is required. Many rehabilitated landfills are now safe parks and public spaces, enjoyed by the community.\nThe register draws information from various sources and all sites listed undergo verification before inclusion on the register.\nWhile this public register will make landfill information more available, it should not be used as the only source of information when making important decisions. EPA will continue to build on the register, adding information and improving the service.\nThis dataset mirrors the VLR data available on EPA's website, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date information on operating landfill please visit the EPA register of permission.",

    "description": "In this product the Burdekin is divided into 5,521 5km x 5km cells. The main feature in this layer is the 'GullyPres' field, which provides a semi-quantitative gully presence value to each cell, ranging from Very Low to Very High. The gully presence assessment is based on several methods including visual observation, output from previous modelling work, bioregion membership, and the output of a mean of prodictive model. The method of mapping is provided in the 'SubMethod' field. The 'Confidence' field provides the source used to assign the 'GullyPres' field value.

A similar service with a\n‘multiCRS’ suffix is available which can support GDA2020, GDA94 and WGS 84 ≈\nGDA2020 environments.\n\nIn due course, and allowing time for user feedback and testing, it is intended\nthat the original service name will adopt the new multiCRS functionality.\nMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleNSW Administrative Boundaries Theme - ParishContent TypeHosted Feature LayerDescriptionNSW Parish is a dataset within the Administrative Boundaries Theme of the FSDF. It contains 7,459 administrative areas (Parishes) formed by the division of 141 counties. Counties and parishes are administrative divisions of the state and are not separately disposable land parcels. County and Parish are historical layers and the information contained on these layers was gathered from Parish and County maps which are now held at State Records (digital versions can be accessed through the Historical Lands Records Viewer). However, they can be updated (if necessary) after a title inspection.Parishes are divided into separately land parcels called “portions”, these being the common basic units of land disposed of by the Crown (sold), held in occupation (leased) or reserved for public purposes. Other basic units are section and allotments in Towns and Villages. The dataset contains county and parish names. Any changes that occur to the dataset should have a reference in the authority of reference feature class in the lot and property data sets.Features are positioned in topological alignment within the extents of the land and property polygons for each county and are held in alignment, including changes resulting cadastral maintenance and upgrades. NSW Parish is a subset of NSW County.This dataset contains an historical land administration boundary. The original Parish definition is static, however, data will move with changes to the Land Parcel and Property theme.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution©\n State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the \nDepartment of Customer Service NSW).

This dataset was captured by \ndigitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales \nand accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the \nNational Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975).\n Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at\n map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, \n1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = \n50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is \nongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen\n Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption \nby common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This data was collected in July 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052010.\n\nDeparted:  Fremantle Australia, July 6, 2010\nArrived:  \t Fremantle, Australia, July 27, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) is the percentage of ground area occupied by the vertical projection of foliage. The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on an automated decision tree classification technique applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM  imagery for the period 1988-2012. The wooded extent product has a nominal accuracy of 85%. The field data used to calibrate the imagery/FPC relationship was mostly collected over the period 1996-1999. Corrections have been applied to remove errors due to topographic effects, cloud, cloud shadow, water, cropping, and regrowth following clearing. Some errors may remain. The product was generated from WRS-2 path/row scenes obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). While some land cover change may be detected in the FPC processing, this product is not designed to generate clearing or regrowth following clearing layers, and should not be used to assess clearing or be compared with previous years for change monitoring without consideration of the error. The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) produces accurate clearing layers for this purpose.",

    "description": "A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image taken of East Gippsland in February 1995 was used to manually classify probable coupe boundaries resulting from logging utilisation on State Forest land.  The classification was undertaken using a visual interpretation method from digitally enhanced Landsat TM data and cross checked with 1:100 000 Landsat TM photographic data.  Probable coupe boundaries were captured digitally using ERDAS Imagine image processing software.  Following identification, probable coupe boundaries were exported as a vector coverage then imported into ARC/INFO where they were intersected with State Forest block and compartment boundaries.  The resulting coverage, containing forest block, compartment and probable coupe boundaries was printed at a scale of 1:100 000 to allow overlay with the Landsat TM photographic prints.\nThe subsequent classification was validated and attributed using regional harvest and wood utilisation plans provided by District Forestry Officers at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) in September 1996.  This layer was used to confirm and provide accurate spatial representation of regional DNRE logging records from 1990 to February 1995.\n\nThe disturance data consists of existing disturbance records for East Gippsland, which have been compiled into one temporary contiguous database.  The 1950 to 1992 (LOGHIST100) data was updated with 1992 to 1994 coupe95 data, and this dataset updated with 1994 to present wood utilisation plans (WUPS) data.  The more recent data was cut into older data.  Component data sets are loghist100, coupe95, and WUPS.\n\nThese are archived datasets, singly owned by Victoria under the RFA Data Agreement of 28 March 2000.\n\nThe completion date for the East Gippsland RFA was 3 February 1997.\n\nThe specific names of these datasets are LOGHIST1, LOGHIST2, LOGHIST3 and LOGHIST123.Available to the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of development, implementation, reporting or review of the Victorian Regional Forest Agreements.\n\nAll derived information products will acknowledge the data owners and carry a statement of origin, currency and reliability of the data.\n\nUse for other purposes by the Commonwealth is subject to the written approval of VicDNRE.\n\nSupply to third parties must be via VicDNRE and is subject to a written data supply agreememt or licence arrangement.\nRestricted\nData must be used within the documented tolerances, completeness, accuracy, precision and quality specifications.",

    "description": "<strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong> \n\nIntroduction \n\nDungog is located in the Upper Hunter Region of New South Wales, approximately 60 km north of Newcastle and 70 km inland from the coastline at Seal Rocks. The township of Dungog is situated at the confluence of the Williams River and Myall Creek. Three smaller catchments including the township, Common Creek and Melbee Estate catchments also provide a source of flood risk to Dungog. \n\nDungog Shire Council (Council) is responsible for flood risk management and local land use planning within their Local Government Area (LGA). Council has commissioned Royal HaskoningDHV (RHDHV) to produce the Dungog Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan (FRMS&amp;P) on behalf of Council and the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH). \n\nThe present FRMS&amp;P included developing a Flood Study that defined flood risk in Dungog from all sources (i.e. Williams River, Myall Creek and local township catchments. The Flood Study was completed in February 2017. \n\nHistory of Flooding in Dungog \n\nThe extreme flooding that devastated Dungog on the 21st of April 2015 was caused by an East Coast Low that caused significant flooding and damage to a number of areas in the Hunter Region and Sydney and is often referred to as the April 2015 “super storm”. The storm produced catastrophic flooding in Dungog resulting in three fatalities, washing four houses away and flooded some 80 dwellings, many to ceiling level. The flood event is likely to have an approximate annual exceedance probability (AEP) of 0.1% or an approximate frequency of a 1 in 1000 year average recurrence interval (ARI). \n\nOther significant floods include: The “Pasha Bulker storm of 8th June 2007 which flooded a number of low lying properties (on Hooke Street and Dowling Street) was approximately a 1 in 20 year ARI magnitude event. Three older significant events (with a 5yr - 10yr ARI magnitude) occurred in February 1990, October 1985 and April 1946. The recent January 2016 event was smaller than a 5yr ARI event.",

This collection consisted of Siltstones, tuffaceous sandstones and limestones of these, Sixty-two were unfossiliferous and in this report only those which were fossiliferous are described in detail. The majority of specimens were siltstones and tuffaceous sandstones, few of which contained good faunal assemblages. It has, therefore, not been possible to say definitely whether some of them are Pliocene (\"h\" stage) or Upper Miocene (\"g\" stage) in age. More definite age could be determined from the assemblage larger foraminifera found in the few limestones. The places where the samples were taken are shown in the accompanying locality map.",

    "title": "Agricultural commodities: December quarter 2015",
    "description": "Overview \r\n The December edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities in 2015-16, and updates the outlook ABARES released in September 2015. \r\n\r\n In addition to commodity forecasts, this publication includes two boxes: \r\n• seasonal conditions in Australia \r\n• farm cash income of broadacre farms \r\n and one article: • key agricultural outcomes of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. \r\n\r\nFarmer/stakeholder implications \r\n The Agricultural commodities report provides high quality and timely information that supports higher farm gate returns through informed decision making by primary producers. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8 per cent in 2015-16 to around $57.6 billion, following an estimated increase of 4 per cent to $53.5 billion in 2014-15. At this forecast level, the gross value of farm production in 2015-16 would be around 17 per cent higher than the average of $49.4 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 13 per cent in 2015-16 to $30.0 billion following an estimated increase of 16 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects expected increases in the farmgate prices for beef cattle, lamb, sheep and wool. \r\n• The forecast increases in farmgate prices are expected to more than offset a forecast decline of 5 per cent in the volume index of livestock production in 2015-16. This mainly reflects an assumption of more favourable seasonal conditions in the latter half of 2015-16 leading to reduced slaughter as a result of herd and flock rebuilding. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 2 per cent in 2015-16 to $27.6 billion alongside an expected increase of 2 per cent in the volume index of crop production. This mainly reflects increases in horticultural production offsetting the falling world prices of grains and oilseeds. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $44.0 billion in 2015-16, following a rise of 6 per cent to an estimated $43.6 billion in 2014-15. At this level, export earnings from farm commodities in 2015-16 would be around 15 per cent higher than the average of $38.2 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• Agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2015-16 include: wheat (up 3 per cent to $5.7 billion), wool (9 per cent to $3.5 billion), wine (3 per cent to $2.1 billion), lamb (1 per cent to $1.7 billion), sugar (8 per cent to $1.4 billion), live feeder/slaughter cattle (16 per cent to $1.3 billion) and chickpeas (56 per cent to $0.6 billion). \r\n• These forecast increases are expected to be largely offset by forecast falls in export earnings from beef and veal (down 3 per cent to $8.6 billion), dairy (6 per cent to $2.3 billion), coarse grains (14 per cent to $2.3 billion), canola (8 per cent to $1.2 billion), cotton (21 per cent to $1.2 billion) and mutton (2 per cent to $0.8 billion). \r\n• Export earnings from fisheries products are forecast to increase by 17 per cent to around $1.7 billion in 2015-16, after increasing by an estimated 10 per cent to $1.4 billion in 2014-15. \r\n• The index of unit export returns for Australian farm exports is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2015-16, following an estimated rise of 6 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects the effect of the assumed lower value of the Australian dollar, especially against the US dollar. \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of beef and veal, wool, wine, lamb, live feeder/slaughter cattle, rock lobster, mutton and chickpeas are forecast to increase in 2015-16. In contrast, export prices of wheat, barley, sugar and dairy products are forecast to decline. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n• World economic growth is assumed to be 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.4 per cent in 2016. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2015-16, compared with 2.2 per cent in 2014-15. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average around US72 cents in 2015-16, 14 per cent lower than the average of US84 cents in 2014-15. \r\n",

    "description": "Health justice partnerships (HJPs) are early intervention programs. Recognising the complexity of disadvantage, they occupy the space where health and social justice issues overlap. Providing integrated, person-centred services, HJPs work with individuals to overcome structural barriers that negatively impact on a person’s quality of life and to advocate for systemic change.\nAlthough there isn’t a clear causality, the relationship between unmet legal need and adverse health outcomes is thought to be mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, chronic illness or disability can cause barriers to accessing legal assistance and can compound social disadvantage. On the other hand, unaddressed legal issues can cause stress and anxiety contributing to mental and physical ill health1.\nBy taking a holistic approach, HJPs remove the need to draw a distinction between legal and health issues. In its evaluation report, Redfern Legal Centre describe the interrelated nature of health and legal issues for one of their clients:\n“Aron was in the MERIT program. He told his counsellor that he was having difficulty in paying back his loan under a Financial Management Order. He told his counsellor that his drug use was increasing due to the stress and anxiety about the debt, which was also increasing due to default fees and other charges. He was referred to the solicitor who found that as Aron was under a Financial Management Order, legally he was unable to deal with his own finances. The loan should never have been given and as such was voided through our advocacy. He reported saying that his stress had decreased significantly, and therefore his drug use.”2\nBy working together through an HJP the health and legal services are able to improve the negative physical and psychosocial factors which jointly impact the health of the individual, and alleviate the strain on the healthcare and legal systems\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This resource was originally published on opengov.nsw.gov.au.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of closed treatment episodes by source of referral. A treatment episode is the period of contact between a client and a treatment provider where there are defined start (commencement) and end (cessation) dates. It is considered closed where any of the following occurs: treatment is completed or has ceased; there has been no contact between the client and treatment provider for 3 months; or there is a change in the main treatment type, principal drug of concern or delivery setting.\nThe alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the closed treatment episode was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment episodes are excluded from the AODTS NMDS if they: are not closed in the relevant financial year; are for clients who are receiving pharmacotherapy and not receiving any other form of treatment that falls within the scope of the collection; include only activities relating to needle and syringe exchange; or are for a client aged under 10 years.\n\n\nSource of referral is the source from which the client was transferred or referred to alcohol and other drug treatment service.\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC09) was collected from a depth of 166m within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~60cm's into the core. For this reason two samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, the first at a depth of 5cm (GC09-5) representing interglacial sediment, and the second from a depth of 60cm (GC09-60) representing glacial sediment. Both samples exhibited high Mg calcite and aragonite, compared with calcite, suggesting that the primary carbonate influx to the core is from the surrounding reef platform, rather than pelagic influences. There was also a 10% increase in non carbonate material during the glacial, and this was primarily made up of feldspars and quartz indicating a relative increase in terrestrial sediment during the LGM.",

    "description": "This dataset contains environmental readings from microclimate sensors located across the city. The data is updated every hour in fifteen minute increments and can be used to determine variations in microclimate changes throughout the day. Microclimate data includes:\n- Ambient air temperature\n- Relative humidity\n- Barometric pressure\n- Particulate matter 2.5\n- Particulate matter 10\n- Average wind speed\n\nThe Microclimate Sensor Readings helps us to understand temperature, relative humidity, pressure, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, and average wind speed at different locations and different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future.\n\nAdditional values are included in this dataset to provide an easier way to correlate the data with the official EPA Victoria data. These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with the Sensor Locations dataset which contains the sensor location. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical microclimate data.\n\nNote this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every 15 minutes as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.\n\nFor the description of each sensor please see the sensor type document.\n\nRelated datasets: \n\nMicroclimate Sensors - Sensor Locations",

    "description": "The National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) is a public Internet database, which provides the community, industry and government with free information about substance emissions and transfers in waste in Australia. The NPI database currently shows emissions of 93 substances from over 4,300 industrial facilities (including more than 870 in Victoria) and from non-industry (or diffuse) sources, such as non-reporting facilities and everyday household activities, including motor vehicle emissions, wood heaters and lawn mowers. \r\n \r\nThe NPI program aims to track levels of substance emissions to air, land and water so communities have access to information about emissions and transfers of toxic substances, that may affect them locally. The NPI specifically aims to:\r\n•         maintain and improve air and water quality;\r\n•         minimise environmental impacts associated with hazardous waste; and\r\n•         improve the sustainable use of resources. \r\n \r\nIndustrial facilities (above certain limits/thresholds) estimate their emissions and transfers annually using a variety of techniques and report to EPA Victoria and other jurisdictions. The diffuse emissions to air and surface waters are estimated by relevant state and territory government departments and published less frequently than the industry reports.  \r\n\r\nNational Pollutant Inventory data is courtesy of the Australian Government and is available from www.npi.gov.au.",

    "description": "Operational map:\nThe operational map for Grey Box Grey Gum Wet Sclerophyll Forest (GBWS) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) interpreted the determination for GBWS and agreed that GBWS TEC is defined from quantitative floristic analyses of systematic plot data. Based on a strong association with the determination assemblage list and documented occurrences referenced in the determination, we have interpreted GBWS to be equivalent to a community described in a recent classification study in the Northern Rivers (OEH, 2012); 1000-1665: (Grey Gum - Grey Box - Hoop Pine shrubby open forest on hinterland hills of the Richmond and Clarence catchments, South Eastern Queensland Bioregion and NSW North Coast Bioregion). \nWe conducted plot-based floristic comparison to assess whether GBWS or the equivalent Community 1000-1665 was present within 800 000 hectares of State Forest in the North Coast area. A map was developed based on plot assignments, aerial photography interpreted map polygons delineated from overstorey and understorey patterns, and results of predictive modelling. \nIn total, we identified approximately 2936 hectares of GBWS TEC in State forests north from Cherry Tree State Forest. Another state forest area has been identified as potentially supporting GBWS forest and is presented in a separate Indicative map.\nIndicative map:\nThe indicative map for Grey Box Grey Gum Wet Sclerophyll Forest (GBWS) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) interpreted the determination for GBWS and agreed that GBWS TEC is defined from quantitative floristic analyses of systematic plot data.

A map was developed based on plot assignments, aerial photography interpreted map polygons delineated from overstorey and understorey patterns, and results of predictive modelling. \nIn total, we identified approximately 2936 hectares of GBWS TEC in State forests north from Cherry Tree State Forest. However, we also assigned three plots to GBWS, which are disjunct from and well outside the previously known distribution, to the south. Of the three disjunct plots, only one is in our state forest study area, in Nymboida state forest. We have no evidence that GBWS occurs south of Nymboida state forest. We identify Nymboida and Kangaroo River state forests in this Indicative Map, as plausible locations for the GBWS TEC. We recommend the GBWS TEC in these areas be diagnosed on a site-by-site basis using our field key until further survey and mapping can be completed in these forests.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.\nIndicative TEC Mapping have been generated from best available composite environmental data layers - standardised to 30 m pixels.",

Three major samplings (summer 1997, winter 1997 and summer 1998) were undertaken to obtain information on seasonal and annual variations.\n\nAn additional study incorporated samples collected from 11-17 m deep areas dredged in 1985, 1994 and 1996 that were compared to the bare sediments in natural basin habitats to the north and south of the sites on the sand bank. Density, biomass and production of invertebrates were lowest in the most recently dredged areas. There were some differences between dredging time and locations within dredging time.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the summary preliminary estimates of the resident population by age and sex as at 30 June 2017, this includes population by sex, median age by sex and percentage of the population within a certain age range. The data is aggregated to the 2017 edition of the Local Government Areas (LGA).\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 3235.0) available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data.\n\n\nRegions which contain unpublished data have been left blank in the dataset.\n\n\nWhere regions have zero population, the relating ratio and percentage columns have been left blank.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2013.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

The transitional NVR Map was prepared by Department of Planning and Environment (DPE) under Part 5A of the Local Land Services Act 2013 (LLS Act) and supporting Local Land Services Regulation 2014.\n\nThe 2022 annual review of the transitional NVR map was published on 23 March 2022. Please read below for details about changes occurring as a result of the 2022 annual review. The latest version of the map can be viewed online using the transitional NVR map viewer.\n\nhttps://www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/Maps/index.html?viewer=NVRMap\n\nSection 108 of the Local Land Services Regulation 2014 states that the NVR map designates category 2-sensitive regulated land as a sub-category of category 2-regulated land and lists the types of land to be included.\n\nDatasets compiled to generate the category 2-sensitive regulated land layer include those identifying land that:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nhas been declared as a Ramsar wetland (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis under a private land conservation agreement\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis Coastal Wetland or Littoral Rainforests mapped under State Environmental Planning Policy (Coastal Management) 2018\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis native vegetation required to be retained within forestry plantations under the Plantations and reafforestation Act 1999\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis an offset under a property vegetation plan or other approval\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis a set-aside under the Land Management (Native Vegetation) Code 2018 or under the Native Vegetation Regulation 2013.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis an approved conservation measure as part of a Biodiversity Certification of land under Part 8 of the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.\n</li>\n<li>\n\ncontains critically endangered ecological communities or plants\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis considered to be core koala habitat under an approved Koala Plan of Management\n</li>\n<li>\n\nis subject to a remedial action or;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nwas mapped as old-growth forest or rainforest under the Comprehensive Regional Assessment undertaken for the Regional Forest Agreements.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe inclusion an/or update of these layers on the NVR map requires the approval of the Secretary DPIE or delegate.\n\nChanges to the mapping of category 2-sensitive regulated land introduced in the publish of the transitional NVR map on 23 March 2022 included:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nadditions to category 2 – sensitive regulated land of set-aside areas approved between February 2021 and October 2021 under the Land Management (Native Vegetation) Code 2018\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCritically Endangered Plants – Refinements to mapping of some critically endangered plants.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPrivate Native Forestry Old Growth Forest and Rainforest – Updates to mapping of Old Growth Forest and Rainforest via private native forestry code approvals under Part 5B or land holder- initiated reviews under Part 5A of the Local Land Service Act 2013.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nProperty Vegetation Plans – Updates to term incentive property vegetation plans (PVP) agreements under the Native Vegetation Act 2003, for which the term has expired.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nBiodiversity Conservation Trust agreements – Refinements of, and updates to conservation agreements managed by the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Trust.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe data is provided as multi value raster that identifies the category 2-sensitive regulated land, category 2-vulnerable regulated land and where category 2-sensitive and category 2-vulnerable regulated land overlaps.\n\nPixel values:\n\n3 - category 2-vulnerable regulated land \n\n4 - category 2-sensitive regulated land \n\n6 - Where category 2-sensitive and category 2-vulnerable regulated land overlap (display class)  \n\nSpatial datasets compiled in the category 2-sensitive regulated land layer are sourced from Department Planning and Environment, Environment Protection Authority, Biodiversity Conservation Trust, Department of the Environment and Energy and NSW Local councils.\n\nData on the transitional NVR viewer is updated on a monthly basis for Landholder minor data changes. https://www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/Maps/index.html?viewer=NVRMap\n\nPlease contact Department of Planning and Environment data broker on data.broker@environment.nsw.gov.au for additional information.",

    "description": "This data set provides mobile (cellular) network performance, allocated to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) boundaries from the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).\nAdditional columns have been added corresponding to the matching boundaries of the 2016 ABS Statistical Area Levels 2, 3 and 4, and the 2020 Local Government Areas. These were spatially joined using the centroid of each polygon, and therefore, should only be used as an approximation. Furthermore, grid cells residing outside of these boundaries, such as offshore or over rivers, are assigned a null value in these columns.",

Vegetation, including trees and plants used for landscaping, and gas plumes emanating from an exhaust stack are also covered. The regulations also apply to any object hazardous to aircraft or aviation-related communications, navigation or surveillance regardless of whether the DAA height controls are triggered.    \r\n\r\nMaps attached to each DAA declaration for each declared Defence Aviation Area show the heights at which proposed structures need to be referred to Defence for approval.\r\n",

As with other types of accidents, pedestrian accident countermeasures can be applied to the human body, the vehicle and the environment, during the pre-crash, crash and post-crash phases. This paper is primarily concerned with reducing injuries to pedestrians through a study of the vehicle during the crash phase of pedestrian accidents.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This resource was originally published on opengov.nsw.gov.au.

Twelve intact sediment cores were collected from this site on the Western Treatment Plant foreshore (Port Phillip Bay, Victoria) and brought back to the laboratory. Four cores were assigned to each of three treatments, which were no dose of effluent, high dose (7mls effluent per minute) or a 'no escape' treatment. The experiment ran for 13 days in December 1999. Throughout the experimental period, dissolved oxygen levels were measured and animals that migrated from the sediment were collected, counted and identified. At the end of the experiment, infauna remaining in the sediment were counted and identified and the wet weight biomass of each species group was recorded.",

Census housing stress data is best used in comparing results over Censuses (ie did it increase or decrease in an area) rather than using it to ascertain what proportion of households were in rental stress.\nIncome bands are based on household income.\nHigh income households can also experience rental stress. These households are included in the total but not identified separately. Data is representative of households in very low, low and moderate income brackets.\nPlease note that there are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data.

    "description": "The Dinosaur Coast National Heritage Management Plan (DCNHMP) - Geological Units data set represents surface exposures of geological units located within the DCNHMP Project Boundary.\nThe primary purpose of this dataset is to describe areas known to contain geological and palaeontological features relevant to The West Kimberley National Heritage listing. These include dinosaur tracks, other ichnofossils and plant macrofossils in the Lower Cretaceous Broome Sandstone, along with associated geological features that provide insights into the depositional environments represented by this rock unit. A suite of overlying and adjacent Pleistocene and Holocene geological units preserving other heritage-listed ichnofossils also occur in these areas. \nAreas preserving features that are relevant to The West Kimberly National Heritage listing are subject to protection under the federal EPBC Act.\nThis dataset originates from observations performed by The University of Queensland’s Dinosaur Lab and is compiled and published through the DCNHMP (2025) project.\nThe DCNHMP project area is approximately 50km of the intertidal zone (the area between highest astronomical tide and lowest astronomical tide) around the town of Broome. The project area extends 15km east-southeast from Broome along the northern shore of Roebuck Bay to Crab Creek and southwest then north away from Broome along the Dampier Peninsula coastline to conclude 25km northwest of Broome at Willie Creek.\nThis dataset is one of three datasets produced by the DCNHMP.

    "description": "The iron Staining Risk theme is divided into two categories:\n\n1) High risk\n2) Low risk\n\nHigh Risk:\nThe iron staining classification represents areas delineated as having an elevated iron / manganese staining risk according to data available at the time of publication. The map does not include all locations that may have iron staining potential. Groundwater staining is commonly caused by the presence of ferric iron in the groundwater (refer to section on groundwater staining), however staining is also caused by manganese and calcium. This set was developed for ‘Perth Groundwater Atlas (2nd Edition), 2004’.\n\nLow Risk: \nGenerally areas away from present or past wetlands with neutral to alkaline pH's will tend to be low in iron concentration. As soil strata are highly variable, neighbourhood bores should be checked to confirm the status of local iron staining risk.\n\nNotes:\nThe accuracy of the 'Perth Groundwater Atlas (2nd Edition), 2004' is limited by the number of sampled monitoring bores. A high density of monitoring bores is generally associated with well-developed suburbs. A reduction in the density occurs in the outlying areas of the Atlas, such as those locations close to the Darling Scarp in the eastern edge of the dataset,\nor in the southern portions of the map sheet.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Iron Staining Risk (DOW-063)",

Counts are of occupied private dwellings which are being purchased (excludes caravans etc in caravan parks and not classifiable households), based on place of enumeration on census night which; includes overseas visitors; excludes Australians overseas; and excludes adjustment for under-enumeration. The data is by SLA 1991 boundaries. Periodicity: 5-Yearly. \nThis data is ABS data (cat. no. 2101.0 &amp; original geographic boundary cat. no. 1261.0.30.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The tabular data was processed and supplied to AURIN by the Australian Data Archives. The cleaned, high resolution 1991 geographic boundaries are available from data.gov.au.\nFor more information please refer to the 1991 Census Dictionary.\nPlease note:\n\n\n(a) Not classifiable households are those dwellings which were temporarily unoccupied at the time of the census, but the collector had ascertained that it was normally occupied or the household contained only persons under 15 years of age.\n\n\n(b) Comprises households where at least one, but not all, member(s) aged 15 years or more did not state an income and/or at least one spouse, offspring, or co-tenant was temporarily absent.\n\n\n(c) Comprises households where no members present stated an income.\n\n",

Each product  contains six digital soil attribute maps, and their upper and lower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths: 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm. These depths are consistent with the specifications of the GlobalSoilMap.net project (http://www.globalsoilmap.net/). The digital soil attribute maps are in raster format at a resolution of 3 arc sec (approximately 90 x 90 m pixels).\n\n          \n\nThese maps are generated by combining the best available Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) products available across Australia.\n\n          \n\nAttribute Definition: 2 micrometre mass fraction of the less than 2 mm soil material determined using the pipette method;\n\nUnits: %;\n\nPeriod (temporal coverage; approximately): 1950-2013;\n\nSpatial resolution: 3 arc seconds (approx 90m);\n\nTotal number of gridded maps for this attribute: 18;\n\nNumber of pixels with coverage per layer: 2007M (49200 x 40800);\n\nTotal size before compression: about 8GB;\n\nTotal size after compression: about 4GB;\n\nData license : Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC By);\n\nTarget data standard: GlobalSoilMap specifications;\n\nFormat: GeoTIFF.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe National Digital Soil Property Maps are generated by combining the best available digital soil mapping to calculate a variance weighted mean for each pixel. Two DSM methods have been utilised across and in various parts of Australia, these being:\n\n              \n\n              1) Decision trees with piecewise linear models with kriging of residuals developed from soil site data \n\n              across Australia. (Viscarra Rossel et al., 2014a);\n\n              2) Disaggregation of existing polygon soil mapping using DSMART (Odgers et al. 2014a).\n\n              \n\n              Version 1 of the National Digital Soil Property Maps combines mapping from the:\n\n              \n\n              1) Australia-wide three-dimensional Digital Soil Property Maps;\n\n              2) Western Australia Polygon Disaggregation Maps;\n\n              3) South Australian Agricultural Areas Polygon Disaggregation Maps;\n\n              4) Tasmanian State-wide DSM Maps.\n\n              \n\n              These individual mapping products are also available in the CSIRO Data Access Portal \n\n              (https://data.csiro.au).

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "\n\n\nThis dataset shows the modelled regional connectivity links for generalist species (birds and small mammals). Based local corridor values based on least cost paths through a local links dataset (see Barrett and Love 2012) at 2012. Categories indicate quality of regional connectivity between larger high value habitat patches. \nDataset has been re-categorised from  the original raster data source to eliminate \"no value\" cells and converted to a vector.\nRegional Linkage Value: This layer is derived from a two-step process. The first process is a “join the dots” links analysis using 550,000 paths between point pairs selected at random. Points were grouped in high value woodland habitat patches only. This least cost pathway analysis was then run through the local links paths, that is regional links were preferentially routed along paths that did not have a canopy gap of &gt;100m. High values indicate that more paths were found, i.e. more important for regional connectivity between high value habitat patches.\nconnectivityLinkageValue:\nRepresents the categorisation of the \"accumulated least cost pathway\" value for each linkage between habitat patches.  Least cost pathway indicates the a combination of habitat suitability of nodes along the path, and a the barriers to migration along that pathway.\nThe ACT connectivity mapping was undertaken by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A full study report has been produced, and is entitled Fine Scale Modelling of Fauna Habitat and Connectivity Values in the ACT Region. This study built upon an earlier report entitled the Ecological Connectivity for Climate Change in the ACT and surrounding region, commissioned by the ACT Government as part of Weathering the Change Action Plan 1. The report was undertaken by the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University (Manning et al 2010). It is recommended that both reports be consulted when use is being made of the connectivity mapping available. Reports can be downloaded from the EPSDD website at https://www.act.gov.au/environment/research-and-data/conservation-research-and-technical-reports (Technical reports 21 and 27).\nUpdates: This dataset is static. \nFit for purpose: 2012 temporal coverage. This dataset should be used as a modelled tool for aiding landuse, strategic town planning, and conservation planning in the ACT including revegetation targets and informing environmental impacts of infrastructure and building projects. Cell size 15x15m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n1. Is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.\n2. Has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses.\n3.

This release of Data by Region presents various data for 2011-2019 and Census of Population and Housing data for 2011 and 2016 and is based on the Statistical Area 3 (SA3) 2016 boundaries. The dataset includes information in the following specified areas of income: Estimates of Personal Income, Gross Capital Gains, Selected Government Pensions and Allowances, Total Personal Income (Weekly) and Equivalised Total Household Income.\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data with the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) SA3 2016 dataset.\n\n\nSome data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.\n\n\nWhere data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.\n\n\nColumns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset includes all parking expiations issued by the Adelaide City Council, and includes data such as payments, current status and exemptions for all parking expiations issued during the last three years.\nThe dataset is refreshed on the 6th day of every month and includes data up to the end of the previous month. The data is re-written each month as statuses etc. do change for expiations issued during the period.  The data is valid as of the date the extract is run.\nFAQs\nWhy is the amount paid greater than the Expiation Amount?\nThe expiation amount is the amount of the original Expiation Fee on the date the Expiation Fee is issued.  After this time additional fees such as Reminder Fees, Search Fees and some others can be incurred which are added to the Expiation. \nAll Expiation Fees, Reminder Fees, Search Fees etc. are set by the State Government.\nWhat is FERU?\nFERU is the Fines Enforcement and Recovery Unit, who are responsible for the recovery and enforcement of unpaid Expiations.  If an Expiation Remains unpaid Council will refer the matter to FERU to recover the debt.  Expiations can also be referred to FERU when a payment plan is entered into.\nWhen an Expiation has been referred to FERU the Offence Balance in the data is $0.\nWhy is the Offence Balance a negative figure?\nOn some occasions Adelaide City Council receives payments (either one or multiple payments) in excess of the amount payable for an Expiation. Council has a procedure in place to identify these payments and try to return the money.",

    "title": "IMOS - ACORN - Phased array HF ocean radar system (WERA)",
    "description": "Coastal ocean surface radar is a land-based technique which uses scattering from the rough sea surface to obtain echoes which are Doppler shifted by the dynamics of the sea.  It has been shown (Crombie, 1955) that the scatter is predominantly a Bragg interaction between the radio wave and the sea surface gravity wave that is propagating in the same direction and with half the wavelength of the radio wave.  This Bragg interaction gives two strong first-order lines in the echo spectrum; one from the resonant gravity wave moving radially away from the station, and one from the resonant gravity wave moving towards the station.\n\nPhased array systems determine the azimuthal angle between the station and a point on the sea surface by forming a narrow beam; the range to the point is set by the propagation delay for the electromagnetic wave.  For the phased array systems, the two radar stations each operate for alternating periods of 5 minutes on and 5 minutes off, and out of phase, so that they can use the same frequency without interfering with each other.  During each 5 minute of operation the radar measures the component of the surface current at each point projected onto the radial from the station to the point.  \n\nAt the end of 10 minutes, the radial components of surface currents can be combined from the two stations to find the vector at each position on the grid.  While surface currents are generally the data of most interest, the phased array systems can also produce significant wave heights and wind directions at each grid point and a calculation of the full directional wave spectrum at ranges of up to about half the maximum range (which is 150 km).\n\nWERA HF ocean radar systems are used in the Capricorn Bunker Group (Tannum Sands and Lady Elliot Island), Queensland, at South Australian Gulf (Cape Spencer and Cape Wiles), South Australia, for Rottnest Shelf (Fremantle and Guilderton), Western Australia, and at Coffs Harbour (Red Rock and North Nambucca), New South Wales.",
