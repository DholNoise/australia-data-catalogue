    "description": "This dataset comprises the phytoplankton abundance and biovolume estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly phytoplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is an integrated water sample collected with niskin bottles at 10m depth intervals and preserved in lugols solution. The depth of the sample varies at each station. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition / abundance (cells/l) 2. Biovolume (um3/L). Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

    "description": "Temperate WA (Kendrick, Babcock, Smale): A cruise was undertaken in collaboration with the University of Western Australian and CSIRO to document benthic assemblages on temperate reefs off the coast of Western Australia in April, 2010. This cruise was the first in a 3 year series of IMOS AUV Facility cruises intended to establish a benthic habitat timeseries along the Eastern and Western coasts of Australia. The expectation is that these surveys will be repeated annually for at least the next two years. Surveys were conducted off Rottnest Island, Jurien Bay, and the Abrolhos Islands. Six sites were surveyed at each location spanning three depths (15 m, 25 m, 40 m), both inside and outside MPAs, with three 25 m x 25 m full photo coverage quadrants devoted to each site. Site locations targeted kelp beds and were provided by the science party. The locations of individual quadrants within each site were decided on‐site, based on bathymetric or depth sounder information. Additional scientific operations carried out during the cruise consisted of CTD casts, HOBO logger equipped moorings deployments, and SCUBA.",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from creeks inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the overall Flood Awareness Map.\n\nCreek flooding occurs when intense rain falls over a creek catchment. Runoff from houses, streets, parks etc contributes to creek flooding. Once the capacity of the creek is reached, overtopping of the banks will occur which can cause flooding. Creek floodwaters can be very fast moving and rise and recede quickly without much warning.\n\nThere are four different creek flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe creek High likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) from BCC’s flood inundation extents usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 5% AEP (20 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Medium likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Low likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).\n\nThe creek Very Low likelihood layer consists of a combination of the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) from BCC’s flood inundation extents (outside high likelihood area) usually utilising the surfaces produced as part of a Flood Study where available and the remaining areas from the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) delivered as part of the Citywide Flood Awareness Mapping study (Worley Parsons, 2012).",

The On Track survey seeks to: Offer a consistent and comprehensive approach to monitoring the transitions of school leavers; Report the information to schools, TAFE institutions and other education providers, organisations concerned with assisting young people, policy makers, parents and students; Provide detailed analysis of the transitions experienced by different groups of leavers; Enable education providers to use the findings to monitor and improve their programs; and Provide a referral service for school leavers who appear to be experiencing difficulties in the transition process.\nOn Track survey data is based on the number of students who responded to the 2019 On Track survey. This is a proportion of those who consented to participate in the On Track survey within the school.\nMoreover, the information about the survey as well as the annual results (current and historical) are also available from DET website (https://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/research/Pages/ontrack.aspx), where the datasets are listed and available in the Data and reports &gt; Year 12 completers summary section.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Katherine for 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a08.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "The aim of this project is to compile land use and management practices and their observed and measured impacts and effects on vegetation condition. The results provide land managers and researchers with a tool for reporting and monitoring spatial and temporal transformations of Australia’s native vegetated landscapes due to changes in land use and management practices. Following are the details for the Big Scrub Rocky Creek Dam, NSW. \n\nPre-European benchmark - analogue vegetation: The site was originally Lowland Subtropical Rainforest on basalt-derived and alluvial soils. The forest is distinguished by its dense, uneven canopy comprised of typically two to three tall tree layers. Eucalypts and brushbox (<em>Lophostemon confertus</em>) may be present as sparse emergent. Characteristic life-forms include buttressed trees, strangler figs, stands of bangalow palms (<em>Archontophoenix cunninghamiana</em>), woody vines and large epiphytes. \n\nBrief chronology of changes in land use and management:<ul>\n<li>1840: Intact rainforest</li>\n<li>1862: Area opened-up for selection</li>\n<li>1900: Cedar getters select large trees</li>\n<li>1910: Rainforest cleared and converted to pasture for dairying</li>\n<li>1911-1948: Area used for grazing dairy cattle</li>\n<li>1948: Area acquired for public use (water storage)</li>\n<li>1950-1989: Minimal management - land in transition (open public space)</li>\n<li>1950-1952: Rocky Creek Dam constructed</li>\n<li>1983-1990: Commenced experiments using assisted regeneration on small test plots</li>\n<li>1991-2000: Large scale assisted regeneration (25&nbsp;ha) by converting lantana thickets to rainforest</li>\n<li>2001-2011: Minimal management.</li>\n\n</ul>",

    "description": "The goal of this project was to gain a regional understanding of the geomorphology of the Kimberley coral reefs, including their interaction with different substrates, morphological patterns, distribution and relative exposure to terrestrial and other impacts. The most cost effective way to determine reef growth architecture is through shallow seismic surveys which will provide information on foundations, previous reef growth events and Holocene buildup, also providing site survey data for collection of Holocene cores. The Holocene reef record will be obtained by coring selected sites, to gain an understanding of sea levels and growth history responses, timing of events during the Holocene, reef building communities, resilience and climate change responses. This involved addressing the following:\nIn summary, our objectives were: \n\nUse remote sensing with limited ground truth checking to establish the regional geomorphology, growth patterns and substrates of the inshore Kimberley reefs;\nDetermine the seismic architecture of selected Kimberley reefs as part of an assessment of Holocene reef growth and relation to antecedent foundations to assess reef growth;\nObtain a Holocene record of sea level change, reef building communities, chronology and growth patterns and climate history of selected inshore reefs for comparison with the short term record, where suitable coral material is obtained; \nWhere possible, quantify reef flat elevations, reef topography and morphology.\n\nPrior to commencement of acquisition of field data in 2013 time was invested in examining technical, equipment and logistic issues presented for SBP surveys and collection of coral reef cores for the remote and “tidally challenged” operational activities that will be required by this project. This is important also for site selection, which to some extent was dependent on other Kimberley project activities and priorities, and on ongoing discussions within WAMSI and with Industry groups. \nOre pit mapping fieldwork was undertaken on a Holocene reef exposed in a mining pit on Cockatoo Island in July 2013 and a paper published on the findings in Marine Geology in 2015. In October 2013 SBP fieldwork was successfully completed and analysis of the data completed. Collection of cores was completed in October 2014, where possible, in the same locations as the SBP, all cores were been logged and sampled and samples sent for dating, dating results for all reefs, except Adele Reef, have been received. The ‘ReefKIM’ database has mapped more than 800 reefs and 30 analysed in detail.\nData is stored at Pawsey Supercomputing Centre on 'WA Node Ocean Data Network' project under 'WAMSI2 &gt; KMRP &gt; 1.3 &gt; 1.3.1'.  There are seven main folders:\n1) 000 Reports  2) 001 Metadata  3) 002 ReefKIM Database  4) 003 Reef Coring  5) 004 Cockatoo Island  6) 005 Seismic  7) 006 Papers.  Detail of folders is available via '1.3.1_Folder_Structure.pdf' which is attached to this metadata record.",

The data is aggregated to Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2), according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 3235.0) available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data.\n\n\nRegions which contain unpublished data have been left blank in the dataset.\n\n",

Data is collected using a range of sensors including laser, sonar, radar and optical.Technical methodologies are used to derive spot heights, raster surfaces, contours, triangulated irregular networks and digital elevation models.Datasets that form the Elevation and Depth theme include: Historical Contours (2m Urban, 10m and 20m)Current 2m Contours (State wide)Spot HeightsRelative HeightsPoint cloud (LiDAR and Photogrammetrically derived) (available for download from Geoscience Australia ELVIS Platform)Digital Elevation Model (available for download from Geoscience    Australia ELVIS Platform) Elevation Data Sets available from additional services.ELVIS – Elevation and DepthPoint Clouds - The point cloud data set consists of point clouds captured from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and derived from airborne imagery using photogrammetric techniques. Spatial Services Point Cloud data is available for on demand download from Geoscience Australia ELVIS Platform. Digital Elevation Models - Digital Elevation Models (DEM) are derived from Spatial Services’ (SS) point cloud data. The DEM is a bare earth representation of the earth’s surface where all the above ground feature has been removed.Spatial Services have a number of different Digital Elevation Models Digital Elevation Model derived from LiDAR - Are 1m or 2m resolution and is not hydrologically enforced(breaklines) or hydrologically conditioned (identification and analysis of sinks).Digital Elevation Model Derived Photogrammetry - Data is 5m resolution. Areas of no data caused by steep slopes, shadow and vegetation have been interpolated or filled-in with another data source and will not be as accurate as the bare open ground areas. The data is not hydrologically enforced (breaklines) or hydrologically conditioned (identification and analysis of sinks).Spatial Services Digital Elevation Model data is available for on demand download from. Geoscience Australia ELVIS Platform as 2km x 2km tiles. You can also access the 5 Metre Digital Elevation Model Service in the Collaboration Portal.Elevation and Depth provides an accurate representation of the Earth’s surface enabling evidence-based decision making, 3D modelling, planning and earth surface representation.Elevation and Depth underpins:Safe hydrographicAeronautical and road navigationClimate science, including climate change adaptationEmergency management and natural hazard risk assessmentEnvironmental, including water managementEngineering projects and infrastructure developmentDefinition of maritime and administrative boundariesNatural resource exploration.Update frequencies vary for each dataset. Individual current status can be found under each Spatial data profile. The objective is to maintain elevation datasets to meet the FDSI requirements of key data users.Current programs include:Aerial LiDAR capture program across NSW.DEM and Point Cloud generation from photogrammetric techniques.Longer term programs include:Update of contour data using updated DEM data generated from LiDAR and Photogrammetry.Hydrological enforcement using improved surface models.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW). For current information go to spatial.nsw.gov.auData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsElevation and Depth Theme of the Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF)AccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the drainage and topographic digital datasets. These datasets were captured primarily by digitising from the best available aerial photography at scales and accuracies ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)OtherWGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentFull stateContent LineagePlease contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityPlease contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This study assesses the effects of  trampling on Hormosira banksii dominated rocky intertidal algal beds within  Point Nepean National Park, Victoria, over six summers between 1991 and 1996. This dataset gives the percent cover of understory algae within beds of Hormosira banksii after exposure to four levels of trampling for 3 and 5 years.  Sites were located at Cheviot Beach (Harry's pool, Cheviot mid) or Grenade Range, ~ 1 km apart.  Percent cover of understory algae was sampled in the Autumn of 1993 and 1995, after 3 and 5 years of trampling, respectively.  Trampling reduced the abundance of articulated coralline algae at the Grenade Range site but not at either of the two Cheviot Beach sites.",

    "description": "The digital '1:2 500 000 geological map of Western Australia' comprises four layers: the primary 1:2 500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:2 500 000 State Cenozoic geology, the 1:2 500 000 State interpreted dyke suites, and the 1:2 500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology structural lines. The 1:2 500 000 interpreted geology contains geoscience data covering themes such as geology and tectonic boundaries that have been digitally rolled up from 1:500 000 data sources for optimal display at 1:2 500 000 scale. The Cenozoic geology layer can be superimposed over the bedrock layer to allow the extension of older bedrock geology under Cenozoic cover where geological and geophysical information permits, and to depict Cenozoic paleovalleys and additional significant Cenozoic cover. The dyke suites layer is primarily interpreted from aeromagnetic data, using mapped dyke extents as a guide. Individual dykes are assigned to named dyke suites wherever possible. The attribution of linear structures and dykes as concealed or exposed takes into account both the interpreted bedrock and the Cenozoic geology layers and does not reflect regolith cover. Detailed fault attribution has been simplified from the 1:500 000 scale, except in the case of major fault systems or tectonic boundaries. The nomenclature and hierarchy of lithostratigraphic units is based on the GSWA weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships and include more recent geochronology. Stratigraphic units are mostly displayed at greater than or equal to Group or Suite level; Subgroups and Formations are only displayed where areal extent warrants it and the unit does not have a higher order parent.

    "description": "The Western Margin survey (GA survey #2476) was conducted on the R.V. Sonne between 25 October 2008 and 19 January 2009 in collaboration with staff from the Western Australia Geological Survey and the University of the Sea. The voyage was operated through the Offshore Energy Security Program, with the principal aims of acquiring geological, geophysical, oceanographic, and biological data over poorly known areas of Australia's western continental margin. A total of 44 video transects were surveyed, with an associated 6,229 still photographs acquired from water depth of 831-4,827 m. Video was recorded to mini DV tapes, and copied to digital format. Video snippets were also created of representative habitats for some stations. Video and image files or associated parent folders are named according to station number, followed by gear code (CAM  = OFOS camera which collected still images and video, GR = BODO grab which collected black and white video) and then the deployment number. For example 36GR19 represents a video transect from Station 36 that was the 19th video transect from the BODO grab on the survey. For further information on this survey please refer to the post-survey report (GA Record 2009/38 - Geocat #69606) and GA Record 2009/26 (Geocat #69358).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "These datasets are long term averages of solar radiation at the surface over the Australian land mass. Applications of these data include solar energy, agriculture, building thermal design and water balance modelling. Climatologies are given for two radiation parameters: the global horizontal exposure, which is the total amount of solar energy falling on a horizontal surface over a time interval; and the direct normal exposure which is the total of the component of radiation from the sun’s disk on a plane perpendicular to the beam. Climatologies of daily exposure are given as an annual average and as a set of twelve monthly averages. Climatologies of the diurnal cycle are given as monthly averages of hourly exposures through the day. These data sets are derived from 23 years (1990 - 2012) of data from satellites operated by Japan Meteorological Agency and the US National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric Administration. NEII",

The dataset includes information in the following specified areas regarding persons born overseas: Overseas Born Population, Year of Arrival in Australia, Australian Citizenship, Religious Affiliation, English Proficiency, Non-School Qualifications, Occupation of Employed Persons, Labour Force and Total Personal Income (Weekly).\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data with the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) LGA 2019 dataset.\n\n\nSome data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.\n\n\nWhere data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.\n\n\nColumns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.\n\n",

    "title": "Consolidated Exposures – Ultimate Risk Basis",
    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nAll banks operating in Australia complete ARF 231. Between March 2003 and September 2010, only those larger RFCs with sizeable overseas assets and/or liabilities completed RRF 231. Bank and RFC positions are reported in Australian dollars (AUD). Non-AUD denominated positions have been converted to AUD using an appropriate end-quarter exchange rate, so changes in reported data between quarters are due not only to changes in positions but also valuation gains or losses due to exchange rate changes.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are reported in this statistical table.\r\n\r\nThe data in this statistical table summarise the country exposures of Australian-owned banks (and selected RFCs between March 2003 and September 2010). This is a smaller reporting pool than in the series reported in statistical table B11.2, which is based on all banks and RFCs reporting ARF/RRF 231 data. The types of assets included here are consistent with those reported in statistical tables B11.1, B11.2 and B12.1, except that the data are consolidated for Australian-owned reporting entities (i.e. includes the claims on countries of all the offices worldwide of entities with head offices in Australia, but excludes positions between different offices of the same group). Consolidated data only include positions with non-residents (in any currency).\r\n\r\nData are shown for a selected group of countries that account for the bulk of the total. Similar data for other countries are also available in statistical table B13.2.1.\r\n\r\nData presented in this statistical table are ultimate risk claims. Ultimate risk claims cover claims on an immediate counterparty location basis that have been adjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the location of the ultimate counterparty/risk. Data on immediate risk claims (expressed by the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis) are available in complementary statistical tables B13.1 and B13.1.2.\r\n\r\nForeign claims refers to all cross-border claims plus foreign offices’ local claims on residents in both local and foreign currencies. It is equal to the addition of local currency claims of reporting entities’ foreign offices on local residents, and international claims. Data for all these accounts on an immediate risk basis are available in a complementary statistical table B13.1.\r\n\r\nInternational organisations are included in the ‘Public sector’ category in the consolidated data (while in the locational data they can be reported as either bank or non-bank depending on the particular organisation). Official monetary authorities (central banks or similar national and international bodies, such as the BIS) are also included in the public sector in the consolidated data (but are treated as banks in the locational data, B12.1 and B12.2). Publicly-owned entities (other than banks) are classed in the ‘Non-bank private sector’ in the consolidated data (and as non-banks in the locational data).\r\n\r\n‘Cross border’ positions are those positions with bank and non-bank counterparties located in a country other than the country of residence of the reporting entity (or its affiliate). This would include, for example, lending by a bank in Australia to a company in France; it would also include loans by that bank’s subsidiary in the UK to a company in France.\r\n\r\n‘Local’ claims are those claims of overseas affiliates of the reporting entity on the residents of the countries in which they are located. These are largely in local currencies but include non-local currencies as well.\r\n\r\nDerivatives are not included in foreign claims. On- and off-balance sheet derivatives are shown separately as a memo item. ‘Derivatives’ are those on- and off-balance sheet derivative exposures (to the country of ultimate risk) that are in a positive market value position. Negative market values of derivative contracts represent financial liabilities and are therefore excluded from the reporting of financial claims. The data mainly comprise forwards, swaps and options relating to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity and credit derivative contracts. Credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps and total return swaps, are included in ‘Derivatives’ if they belong to the trading book of a protection-buying reporting entity. Credit derivatives that belong to the banking book are reported as risk transfers by the protection buyer. All credit derivatives are reported as guarantees by the protection seller.\r\n\r\n‘Guarantees’ refers to contingent liabilities arising from an irrevocable obligation to pay to a third-party beneficiary when a client fails to perform some contractual obligations. They include: secured, bid and performance bonds; warranties and indemnities; confirmed documentary credits; irrevocable and stand-by letters of credit; acceptances; and endorsements. Guarantees also include the contingent liabilities of the protection seller of credit derivative contracts.\r\n\r\n‘Credit commitments’ covers arrangements that irrevocably obligate an institution, at a client’s request, to extend credit in the form of: loans; participation in loans, lease financing receivables, mortgages, overdrafts or other loan substitutes; or commitments to extend credit in the form of the purchase of loans, securities, or other assets (e.g. back-up facilities including those under note issuance and revolving underwriting facilities).\r\n",

    "title": "Assessment of Swamp Oak Floodplain Forest TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate (South Coast Region)",
    "description": "The operational map for Swamp Oak Floodplain Forest (SOFF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast. \nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for SOFF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that SOFF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of SOFF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas.\nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain SOFF. We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of SOFF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the SOFF determination.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to SOFF based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and model output underlying each API polygon. \nIn total, we mapped approximately 272 hectares of SOFF across our full study area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

Part of a suite of polygon datasets that best represent remnants of original pre-1750 vegetation across the mapped areas as at 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2024. The polygons represent interpreted areas of vegetation using current and historical digital aerial photography (1953-present) sourced from State Government repositories and other commercial products e.g. Digital globe, ESRI wayback imagery and Google. Simplified condition of the vegetation has been attributed to some polygons. \n\nThe mapped area covers the Metropolitan and Peel Region Schemes, the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion as defined in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia V 7.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2025) and the Swan Coastal Plain vegetation complexes (DBCA-046) (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2016). \n\nFor further information refer to Explanatory Report titled 'Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel remnant native vegetation extent mapping in 2000-2020 (5 yearly interval) and the year 2024.pdf'",

    "description": "In 2005 Geoscience Australia and the National Oceans Office undertook a joint project to produce a consistent, high-quality 9 arc second (0.0025 decimal degree (dd) or ~250m at the equator) bathymetric grid for Australian waters. In 2009 a number of new datasets were included in an updated version of the grid.\n, The 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia was produced to include recently acquired datasets, and solutions to issues identified in the previous version. The revised grid has the same extents as its 2005 counterpart, including the Australian water column jurisdiction lying between 92o E and 172o E, and 8o S and 60o S. The waters adjacent to the continent of Australia and Tasmania are included, as are areas surrounding Macquarie Island, and the Australian Territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The area selected does not include Australia's marine jurisdiction offshore from the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory.\n, As per the 2005 grid, the 0.0025 dd resolution is only supported where direct bathymetric observations are sufficiently dense (e.g. where swath bathymetry data or digitised chart data exist) (Webster and Petkovic, 2005). In areas where no sounding data are available (in waters off the Australian shelf), the grid is based on the 2 arc minute ETOPO (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) and 1 arc minute ETOPO (Amante and Eakins, 2008) satellite derived bathymetry. The topographic data (on shore data) is based on the revised Australian 0.0025dd topography grid (Geoscience Australia, 2008), the 0.0025dd New Zealand topography grid (Geographx, 2008) and the 90m SRTM DEM (Jarvis et al, 2008).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nBoth the floodway and flood fringe make up the 1 in 100 (1%) annual exceedance probability (AEP) floodplain, however there are areas where the floodplain exists, but the floodway and flood fringe does not. In such situations, a different floodplain management strategy applies (for example, the Swan River between the Narrows and Canning Bridges).\n\nThis dataset contains four lines - Floodway limit, Extent of 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flooding, Extent of floodway &amp; Extent of study. \n\nThe Floodway limit, Extent of floodway and Extent of 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Flooding and Extent of study line types are boundaries which appropriately overlay over the \"FPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Areas\" (polygon) dataset. \n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River – Toodyay, Northam, York and Beverley Townsites. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nBlackwood River – Augusta, Bridgetown, Nannup and Boyup Brook Townsites.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nBrunswick River - Greater Bunbury \n</li>\n<li>\n\nCoblinine River &amp; Dorderyemunning Creek - Wagin Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nChapman River – Geraldton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDenmark River – Denmark Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGascoyne River - Carnarvon Townsite and the Lower Gascoyne.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGribble Creek - Kalgoorlie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHarding River - Roebourne Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nIrwin River - Dongara Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLower Collie River - Greater Bunbury.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Donnybrook Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSerpentine River, Peel, Birrega &amp; Oaklands Drains, Murray River and the Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary - Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Pinjarra and south to the Darling Scarp (Murray River) and Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Wellard (Peel Main Drain), east to South Western Highway (Serpentine River) and north to Wungong Brook (Birrega Drain).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Perth - Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River). Tributaries include Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Ellen Brook, Helena River, Henley Brook, Jane Brook, St Leonards Creek, Susannah Brook (Swan River) and Southern River/ Wungong Brook (Canning River).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nToby Inlet – Quindalup Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nVasse-Wonnerup Estuaries, Broadwater and New River - Busselton Townsite.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor further information on flooding and floodplain management in Western Australia, please refer to our Water Facts publications: Flooding in Western Australia (Water facts 13) and Floodplain Management (Water facts 14).\n\nThis information is available at the following addresses:\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-13-Flooding-in-Western-Australia.pdf\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFlood fringe - the area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway where development could be permitted provided it is compatible with flood hazard and building conditions provide an adequate level of flood protection. These areas are generally covered by still or very slowly moving waters during a 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodway - the river channel and a portion of the floodplain where a significant flow or storage of water occurs during floods. If the floodway is even partially blocked, then the natural flooding regime of the area may be detrimentally impacted with flood levels being raised and affecting areas which may not have been previously affected. Development in floodways is to be avoided wherever possible.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "The study focussed on the estuarine portion of the Swan-Canning River system, WA using the black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), an estuarine dependent fish species, as a biomonitoring tool.  Prior to the commencement of this study it had been determined that the black bream was a suitable fish species for use as a biomonitoring tool when using mixed function oxygenase (MFO) activity induction under laboratory conditions. Biopsies taken from feral black bream collected from eight sites during the period 2000 to 2002 from the estuary confirmed that the use of MFO induction in this fish species as a biomarker of exposure to organic contaminants is a reliable biomarker.",

Having defined preferred and non-preferred terms within sport is intended to promote consistency in terminology across the entire sporting community.

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in tropical woodland using eddy covariance techniques. The site was situated within a wetland that flooded seasonally. The principle vegetation was <em>Oryza rufipogon</em>, <em>Pseudoraphis spinescens</em> and <em>Eleocharis dulcis</em>. The elevation was approximately 4m, with a neighbouring Bureau of Meteorology station recording 1411mm mean annual precipitation.Maximum temperatures ranged from 31.3°C (in June and July) to 35.6°C (in October), while minimum temperatures ranged from 14.9°C (in July) to 23.9°C (in December and February). Maximum temperatures varied on a seasonal basis by approximately 4.3°C and minimum temperatures by 9.0°C.  The instrument mast was 15m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation were measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes were measured and soil moisture content was gathered using time domain reflectometry. Ancillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, N and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the transect in September 2008. This data is also available at http://data.ozflux.org.au .",

    "description": "This vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale.\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia.\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use.\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use.\nThis update refreshes the entire state of Western Australia to ALUM v8.",

    "description": "This data is Statistical Local Areas (SLA) based Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) - Is a continuum of advantage to disadvantage. Low values indicate areas of disadvantage; and high values indicate areas of advantage. This data is based on the 2006 census and follows the 2006 Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) boundaries.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has developed indexes to allow ranking of regions/areas, providing a method of determining the level of social and economic wellbeing in that region. There are four indexes included in the SEIFA 2006 product. They relate to socio-economic aspects of geographic areas. Each index summarises a different aspect of the socio-economic conditions in an area. The indexes have been obtained by a technique called principal components analysis. This technique summarises the information from a variety of social and economic variables, calculating weights that will give the best summary for the underlying variables. For the SEIFA indexes, each index uses a different set of underlying variables.\nAll the indexes (including the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage) have been constructed so that relatively disadvantaged areas (e.g. areas with many low income earners) have low index values.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 2033.0.55.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \nFor more information on this data please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Please note: \n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data following the 2006 ASGC.\n",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

The Great Northern Seam in places is sufficiently thick for open cut mining but the coal is generally of very poor quality and the overburden to coal ratio much too high to warrant further drilling. Continued prospecting of the Fassifern Seam in this area is not warranted, because of the very poor quality of the coal in this seam. This report contains an account of the operations, and describes the results of the geological investigations. The results of drilling are detailed in the accompanying plates and bore logs.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

It is envisaged that the 2016 and successive Censuses will be added in the future, as well as administrative data sets. The ACLD is released in ABS TableBuilder and as a microdata product in the ABS Data Laboratory. \r\n\r\n The Census of Population and Housing is conducted every five years and aims to measure accurately the number of people and dwellings in Australia on Census Night. \r\n\r\n Microdata products are the most detailed information available from a Census or survey and are generally the responses to individual questions on the questionnaire. They also include derived data from answers to two or more questions and are released with the approval of the Australian Statistician.\r\nThe following microdata products are available for this longitudinal dataset: \r\n•ACLD in TableBuilder - an online tool for creating tables and graphs. \r\n•ACLD in ABS Data Laboratory (ABSDL) - for in-depth analysis using a range of statistical software packages.\r\n\r\n",
