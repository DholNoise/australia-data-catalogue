    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This database contains geochemical data for samples analysed both for inorganic and organic geochemistry. Analytical data are sourced from Geoscience Australia's Inorganic Geochemistry Database (OZCHEM) and Organic Geochemistry Database (ORGCHEM), respectively. The data are joined on a unique sample number. Inorganic geochemical data cover the majority of the periodic table, with metadata on analytical methods and detection limits. Organic geochemical data include results of pyrolysis, derivative calculated values, and, where available, isotopic composition of carbonates (D13C) and isotopic composition of rock nitrogen (D15N). Further, there are provisions for delivery of isotopic data for kerogen (H, C, N) and oxygen (O) for carbonates. Where available, sample descriptions include stratigraphic unit names and ages, and lithology. Location information includes coordinates of the sampled feature (eg, borehole), coordinates of the sample and sample depth. Interpretation of the combined inorganic and organic geochemistry for organic-rich shales will facilitate comprehensive characterisation of hydrocarbons source rocks and mineral commodities source and trap environments. All are achieved within the frameworks of petroleum and mineral systems analysis. The initial data delivered by this service include 1785 samples from 35 boreholes from 14 geological provinces, including recently released data for 442 samples from the South Nicholson National Drilling Initiative Carrara 1 stratigraphic drill hole (Butcher et al., 2021; Carson et al., 2021). Many sampled boreholes are located within the polygon of the Exploring for the Future Barkly-Isa-Georgetown project. This dataset will be updated periodically as more data become available.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for December 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

By animating time-based data, it can be visualised at each step, highlighting patterns or trends emerging over time.\nSpatial Collaboration Portal map layers that are time enabled include different information for the same location at different times.\nWhen a dataset contains time enabled layers, it is “time aware”, and can be configured to display the data during a specific period or to animate the data over a selected time. Time animation can be enabled in the map viewer using the time slider tool.\nFeatures included in the NSW Cadastre History Service\nLot <b>-</b> Depicts a parcel of land created on a survey plan. Each lot may be represented by standard lots, standard part lots, strata or stratum. Each lot has a lot number, section number, plan lot area, plan number, plan label, ITS title status, and stratum label. \nRoad <b>-</b> Represents dedicated public roads which are open ways for the passage of vehicles, persons or animals on land. The road dataset includes public roads in use. Each road type has a section number, plan number, plan label, ITS title status, road type, road width or Crown/Council width, lot number, and stratum label.\nUnidentified <b>- </b>Represents a parcel of land that cannot be identified. Crown land, vested, dedicated and severed land may be included in this category as well as Old System lots for which lot/DP identification cannot be found. This dataset also identifies the locations of 100ft wide reserves, ACT regions, closed roads, crossings, surveyed areas, and un-surveyed areas. \nWater Feature<b> - </b>Represents tidal, non-tidal and ocean waters which form a cadastral boundary.\nThe NSW Cadastre History Service can be used for resource management, environmental management, land use planning, agriculture management, emergency management and recreational purposes. This service can be used to aggregate information for analytical purposes. When used in combination with geocoded address data, imagery, demographic information and agency specific business information, cadastral boundary data underpins the ability to perform high quality spatial analysis.\n<b>How to use the animated time feature</b><ol><li>Open the “Map Viewer”.</li><li>Select the time enabled feature layer from the contents.</li><li>Select the “Configure” button (the icon to the bottom right that looks like two slider controls) to open time settings.</li><li>Select “Show Advanced Settings”</li><li>Choose your desired playback speed</li><li>Choose a time and date for “Start Time” and “End Time”. Note.

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975).

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThe dataset provides a summary for all the locations where maximum drawdown impact and the time when the maximum drawdown impact occurs are generated by the Clarence-Moreton groundwater model. A total of 982 pilot points were selected for layer 1. For other layers, the groundwater model provided predictions at locations where economic receptors were registered in companion product 1.4 for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion. In total, 1462 predication locations are described in the dataset with their corresponding layer numbers.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset is an extraction from pre-registered datasets as specified in the dataset lineage. \n\n\n\nMajor actions applied to the extraction include:\n\n1.\tClip the economic receptors associated with groundwater using the Clarence-Moreton groundwater model boundary.\n\n2.\tAssign the economic receptors derived in step 1 to a specific layer in the groundwater model using the aquifer assignment database compiled in companion product 2.1/2.2.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) CLM groundwater model prediction location.

    "title": "A stocktake of selected agricultural markets of the European Union - Opportunities for Australia",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n The report A stocktake of selected agricultural markets of the European Union: Opportunities for Australia compiles five articles on EU agricultural industries that were originally published in ABARES Agricultural Commodities quarterly reports between June 2016 and March 2017. These articles were on almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. The report examines EU domestic policies and markets, and trade opportunities for Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Since the mid 1990s the share of total Australian exports destined for the EU has been declining in favour of more lucrative and geographically closer Asian markets. \r\n• Part of the reason for the decline in the share of Australian exports to the EU has been caused by the regulation that supports the EU agricultural sector. EU agricultural imports are subject to restrictive quotas, in-quota tariffs and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• The Australian Government and the European Commission are working towards commencing negotiations for a free trade agreement. As the European Union is one of the largest consumers of agricultural goods in the world, a preferential agreement that improves access to the EU market may present opportunities for Australian agricultural exporters. \r\n• The commodities covered in this report are almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. These are high value or growing Australian agricultural industries. \r\n• The EU imports agricultural products from a large number of countries and has numerous existing trade arrangements with these countries. Australia therefore faces significant competition in the EU market for the five commodities. \r\n• The articles discuss the existing trade trends and EU policies for each of the five commodities. For beef, dairy and sugar it is posited that only a significant reduction in tariffs or enlargement of quotas would precipitate a strong diversion of Australian trade away from the geographically closer Asian markets to the European Union. This is because of weakening EU import demand given growing supplies of lower-priced, domestically produced product. \r\n• Australian exports of sheep meat to the European Union are constrained by a relatively small quota of 20,000 tonnes, which it has largely filled in each of the past 5 years. Australian exporters of sheep meat would benefit from improved access to that market given strengthening EU demand for sheep meat and relatively high prices. \r\n• EU imports of almonds are subject to a low tariff and import demand has been growing steadily. Removal of the tariff on Australian almonds would improve Australia's relative competitiveness but gains are expected to be modest over the medium term given the dominant foothold of the United States in the EU almond market. \r\n• The effect of Brexit on EU agricultural commodities markets and trade is uncertain at this stage. \r\n",

    "description": "All designated neighbourhood government schools (referred to as a local school) have a school zone. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English language schools, selective entry high schools, or community schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nEvery Victorian child has the legislated right to enrol at their local government school. A school zone does not restrict a student's  choice to seek enrolment at other government schools. Students can enrol at a school outside their zone if the school has sufficient accommodation and it aligns with the school’s enrolment management implementation plan, where applicable.\nFor students residing in metropolitan Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the local school is usually the nearest government school in a straight line from the student’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is usually the nearest school by the shortest practical route, recognising the additional travel distances often experienced in regional settings.\nIt is recognised that some school zones need to be aligned with geographical and structural barriers that significantly impede direct school access such as rivers and freeways. A main road with pedestrian crossings, however, is not usually considered to be a barrier to accessing a school.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect new schools opening, changing provision at existing schools (e.g., relocating a campus or changing year levels offered), improving school accessibility, or managing enrolment demand.\nThe school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website. More information on Victorian school zones can found at https://www.vic.gov.au/school-zones.\nSchool zones have been produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. The location point for all government schools is taken from the department’s register of school locations. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset have been used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2017 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions dataset is maintained for the purpose of reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries. \n\nThis 2015 version defines the Peel-Harvey NRM region. A boundary for the newly established OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation has not been spatially defined. It has responsibility for enhancing fish habitats and improving water quality in estuaries and coastal marine environments. OceanWatch works with the fishing industry to continue the adoption of industry best harvesting practice and identify issues of common interest for fishers across Australia.\n\nThe 2015 version maintains the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas. The 2012 version updated and formalised the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset. Whilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\n\nSince 2006, NRM regions have been important in the delivery of Australian Government funding initiatives including Caring for our Country, the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Landcare Program, the Environmental Stewardship Program and the Working on Country Indigenous land and sea ranger program.\n\nIn total, this dataset represents 61 regions as set out below. They comprise 56 mainland regions administered by 55 NRM regional bodies (the Cooperative Management Area in QLD is jointly administered by the two adjacent regional bodies: the Cape York and Northern Gulf NRM bodies) and seven islands (five administered by the Australian Government as external territories, and two administered by nearby mainland NRM regional bodies).\n\nQueensland\n1.

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in New South Wales (NSW), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of New South Wales connected by Sydney trains (T1-T9) and Metro services (Metro North West line) have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "As part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018) the Melbourne Water operating region was split into a series of sub-regions. This includes 5 catchments, and 69 sub-catchments. The boundaries of each region generally follow catchment boundaries. There are two separate spatial scales:- Catchments (5 regions: Werribee, Maribyrnong, Yarra, Dandenong, Westernport) and Sub-catchments (69 polygons). This dataset is an update to the Regional River Health Strategy (RRHS) Management Units layer created in 2008. Primary purpose of this data is for reporting of targets, performance objectives, conditions, values etc. relating to the Healthy Waterways Strategy.The sub-catchments in this dataset are an update of the \"management units\" developed for the Regional River Health Strategy in 2008. This dataset was created by merging sub-catchments from the University of Melbourne sub-catchments layer, commonly referred to as the DCI layer (where DCI refers to Directly Connected Imperviousness). The catchment polygons in this layer are similar to, but not exactly the same as those in the DCI layer currently used internally at Melbourne Water - The internally used layer has 15,901 polygon catchments, whilst the layer used to create this dataset has 16,346 polygon catchments. The Melbourne Water internal dataset will shortly be updated to align.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains polygon and line shapefiles representing the Gloucester terrestrial (both a multipart and singlepart version) and riverine Landscape Classes respectively. It also contains KMZ exports of these features.\n\n\n\nNote: This differs from previous versions in that the extent was extended to the Gloucester AE boundary (previously  the extent was to the PAE) so the discontinuous river lines that weaved in and out of the PAE boundary could be wholly included.\n\n\n\nThe polygon landscape Classes are as follows.\n\n\n\nTerrestrial (polygons)\n\nForrested Wetlands\n\nFreshwater Wetlands\n\nRainforests\n\nDry sclerophyll forests\n\nWet sclerophyll forests\n\nSaline wetlands\n\n(Non-GDE) Native vegetation\n\nPlantation or production forestry\n\nDryland agriculture\n\nIrrigated agriculture\n\nIntensive uses (includes mining)\n\n\n\nNote forestry that selectively logs native forests is included in the \"(Non-GDE) Native vegetation\" class rather than the economic \"Plantation and production foresstry\" class.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe terrestrial Landscape class polygons are sourced directly from the two input polygon source datasets and clipped to the Gloucester PAE.\n\n\n\nGDE landscape classes derive directly from the source NSW OoW GDE layer's Keith Form attribute, though the \"Riverine Forests\" Keith form are combined with the \"Forested Wetlands\" LC and the \"Mangrove Swamps\" and \"Saltmarshes\" Keith Forms are combined to form the \"Saline Wetlands\" LC . \n\n\n\nThe remaining non-GDE terrestrial LC polygons are mainly sourced from the ACLUM catchment landuse from the PRIMARY V7 classification, and retain the source class names except that  \"1 Conservation and natural environments\" is rename the \"non-GDE Native Vegtation\" LC.  A further exception  is the \"Plantation and Production Forestry\" LC. This is derived from the SECONDARY_V7 classification where:\n\n\n\n\"SecondV7\" = '2.2 Production forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '3.1 Plantation forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '4.1 Irrigated plantation forestry'\n\n\n\nThe Riverine LC lines are derived directly from the Rivertypes source dataset\n\n\n\nNote for the 2016 March 9 IESC Deep Dive for GLO was necessary to tease out the Keith Forms of the \"non-GDE native vegetaton\" Landscape class in order to generate areal statistics for endangered species habitats. These were sourced from the Greater Hunter vegetation mapping. This sub-LC differentiation is retained in this dataset\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) GLO Landscape Classification polygons 20170324 v06.

    "description": "<b>Version Oct 2021  </b>\nThe Building Heights Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils. \n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

The data was created by digitising the published business directories using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. The extracted information includes the business name, address and business type as listed in the Sands &amp; McDougall directories. The address information was subsequently geocoded to provide a spatial location. The data spans the the Sands &amp; McDougall's Directory of Victoria publication years 1896, 1925 and 1974.\nVictoria Unearthed is a collection of data which includes past and present information about historical businesses, potential land and groundwater contamination, as well as information about contamination management and cleanup activities. Victoria Unearthed has been created in response to the Independent Inquiry into the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Government of Victoria - Department of Land, Water and Planning.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAttributes captured by OCR (\"directory address\", \"business name\" and \"business type\") are uncorrected and may include errors.\n\n\nThe positional accuracy is affected by the limitations inherent with OCR and geocoding. Some issues such as changing street names, are exacerbated by the age of the records.\n\n\nThe directories were not consistent in the amount of information captured as the business address, in many cases it only lists the town or suburb for the business.\n\n\nA modern (July 2018) property address, street or locality as defined by VicMap has been captured for all records.\n\n\nAdditional information has been provided to allow the accuracy of the results to be evaluated with each record containing the data used at each stage of the data capture process.\n\n",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016</b>\nThe Overland Flow Path Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a05.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) route segments for the year of 2016. Route segments are a public transport link between two adjacent activity nodes or other network nodes. A numbered public transport route is usually made up of a sequence of consecutive route segments\nThe SNAMUTS methodology has been developed as a planning and decision-making support tool. It determines accessibility performance from a user perspective, bearing in mind that different users sometimes have different needs: some may value speed more than anything else, some may require barrier-free access as their first priority, others may be drawn primarily to services that are legible and have a high profile in the urban realm. Good accessibility is often the result of a balance and integration of these sometimes competing, sometimes complementary claims on the usability of the land use-transport system. The analysis includes a set of tasks and measurements that highlight the contribution of the public transport network and service development from a range of perspectives.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n\n\nService Intensity\n\n\nCloseness Centrality\n\n\nDegree Centrality\n\n\nNetwork Coverage\n\n\nContour Catchments\n\n\nBetweenness Centrality\n\n\nResilience\n\n\nNodal Connectivity\n\n\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nThis data provides context to the corresponding indicator datasets: \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Activity Nodes (Point) 2016\" or \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Areas (SA1) 2016\".\n\n\nSome routes are composed of disjoint line segments and as such the data should be used for visualisation purposes only.\n\n",

    "description": "This study investigated the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of shrimp in Western Port Bay from July 1977 to January 1980. Water temperature, salinity and oxygen concentrations at the sediment surface were measured from a boat at high tide during the field sampling (see parent record 'The ecology and trophic role of caridean shrimps in the eelgrass community of Western Port, Victoria', File identifier: 268431c0-f18e-11dc-aaae-00188b4c0af8). Additional measurements of low tide surface water temperature over the mudflats, sediments below the mud-water interface, and surface waters of the large, permanent channels between mudbanks were obtained. Above-ground vegetation cover was sampled monthly for 12 months at Site A. \n\nThe water temperature in the eelgrass ranged from 10 to 24 degrees Celsius during high tide and from 5 to 31 degrees Celsius during low tide. Salinity was close to fully marine throughout the warmer months of 1977-78, but fell to lower levels during the cooler months of 1978, presumably as a result of higher rainfall in the latter period. Oxygen concentrations were above 6 ppm at all sites during high and low tide sampling. The dry mass of above-round eelgrass was spatially heterogeneous with few changes in these patterns between seasons.",

    "description": "This data was collected in March 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R4.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, March 1, 2011\nArrivec:  Hobart Australia, March 5, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "title": "A Probabilistic Assessment of Tsunami Hazard in the Indian Ocean",
    "description": "The Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004 made starkly evident the need for better information on tsunami hazard in the Indian Ocean. The tsunami threat faced by Indian Ocean countries consists of a complex mix of tsunami from local, regional and distant sources, whose effects at any particular location in the Indian Ocean are highly dependent on variations in sea floor shape between the source and affected coastlines, complicating tsunami disaster management and the design of tsunami warning systems for the Indian Ocean. In order to provide national governments in the Indian Ocean with the information they need to make informed decisions about tsunami mitigation measures, including development of a warning system,  a comprehensive hazard and risk ass\n\nIn this presentation we discuss the results of this assessment. The study focused on tsunami caused by subduction zone earthquakes, because they are the most frequent source of large tsunami, and tsunami hazard is expressed as annual probability of a tsunami exceeding a given amplitude at a given offshore depth. Because so little is known about the recurrence rates of large megathrust earthquakes in the subduction zones bordering the Indian Ocean, it was decided to develop two hazard maps: a 'low-hazard' end member, based on only those earthquake sources of tsunami for which there is definite evidence, and a 'high-hazard' end member, based on all potential megathrust earthquake sources, including hypothetical ones for which there is no historical or geological evidence, that may affect Indian Ocean coastlines. The actual hazard lies somewhere between these two end members, and the difference between the low hazard and high hazard maps is a simple and effective way to express the uncertainty in the hazard assessment. This uncertainty reflects the lack of knowledge of tsunamigenic earthquake occurrence, and can only be reduced through a better understanding of earthquake and tsunami occurrence in the Indian Ocean.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The data is an update of that presented in the APS Statistical Bulletin 2012-13.\r\nData becomes available at six monthly intervals — through this summary for calendar year data and through the annual State of the Service Report (SOSR) and APS Statistical Bulletin (the Bulletin). The data in these tables is sourced from the APS Employment Database (APSED), which contains data extracted from agencies’ HR systems.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Public Service Commission continues to work with agencies to improve the quality and timeliness of the data they provide to APSED. Each year extensive audits and error checking of APSED are undertaken, to ensure that sound conclusions can be drawn from the data. Through this audit process, previously published data has been updated. The June 2013 data published in SOSR and the Bulletin has been revised.\r\n\r\nAs in the Bulletin, a headcount approach is used in these tables—that is, people working part-time are aggregated with people working full-time without weighting. Data also includes inoperative staff. Employees’ classification in these tables refers to their base or substantive classification. ",

    "description": "ACT Canopy Estimate Statistics 2020 for blocks, divisions and road polygons are derived from the ACT Canopy Cover 2020 footprint dataset (available soon). The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area). The total tree canopy cover estimate for Canberra for 2020 is based on the footprint of all urban divisions (suburbs): 22.5%.

The point clouds were processed by the ACT Government with ArcGIS to produce ACT Canopy Cover footprint for vegetation above 3m. Canopy modelling was completed at 1m resolution. The canopy footprints were then augmented to block, division and road polygon coverage statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate system: GDA 2020 MGA Zone 55.\n\nTemporal coverage: April 2020\n\nUpdate schedule: every 5 years\n\n\n\nTile photo by Mark Jekabsons, Trees over Gungahlin\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveat: Comparison of the ACT 2020 Canopy Cover to the 2015 is not comparable due to differences in methodology, including differences in resolution and point density, and time of year the LiDAR was captured. The 2015 data was captured in late Autumn, whereas 2020 was captured in early Autumn.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2010, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "title": "Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and Non-CALD Populations (2001)",
    "description": "This dataset provides a composite measure of heat vulnerability for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations in Australia, integrating three key indicators: heat exposure, heat sensibility, and heat adaptive capability. Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2014 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 1,126,441 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either:  \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed.  \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2014 car parking event data there are 3,377 records where the parking event goes into 2015 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.56GB, 51.5 million rows)",

    "description": "The prevalence of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in and around the Galactic center and the bulge has been one of the key questions in pulsar astronomy. In addition to finding more exotic and interesting binary systems at and around the Galactic center and bulge due to the enhanced density of stars/stellar remnants, MSPs are also proposed to be one of the candidates to explain the observed Fermi gamma-ray excess. However, most of the MSPs discovered so far are field (disk) MSPs or those in globular clusters. Initial steps towards addressing the question of Galactic center/bulge MSPs were made with the discovery of the first MSPs in a Galactic filament, but more progress comes from the discovery of a sample of MSPs around the Galactic center. Blind surveys targeting MSPs can suffer from many observational biases that smear the pulses due to binary acceleration, scattering from the enhanced density, and so on, which increases the parameter space for discovery and can sometimes make the problem intractable. However, if pulsar candidates can be identified reliably from imaging surveys, then targeted observations can make the problem tractable in identifying the pulsations. We followed up a sample of polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT bulge imaging survey and discovered a sample of 16 new MSPs. Here we request the timing observations of 8 interesting MSPs (a subset of our discovery sample), to study the binary nature of these sources and their potential inclusion in pulsar timing array efforts.",

    "description": "Age of individual fish collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nAbundance and diversity of riverine fish populations are monitored annually at fixed sites within six Selected Areas using a standardised sampling regime involving boat or backpack electrofishing and fine mesh fyke nets (referred to as Category 1 sampling). These methods target large-bodied and small-bodied fish species respectively. A sample of measured individuals (length and weight) were collected for otolith sectioning and age determination to construct age vs length and weight relationships.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin.

    "description": "Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) - Vegetation Complexes - SWF50k\n\nThe dataset is a comprehensive coverage of pre-1750 distribution of vegetation complexes of the south west forest region of Western Australia. This 1:50,000 mapping was undertaken by Mattiske and Havel (1998) as part of the biodiversity assessment for the comprehensive regional assessment for the south west forest region. The outputs from this project were used as inputs to the assessments of national estate, ecologically sustainable forest management, endangered species and the integration of all these values in the 1999 Regional Forest Agreement (RFA). This dataset covers the full extent mapped by Mattiske and Havel (1998) not just the area within the RFA boundary.\nIn March 2015 the dataset was reviewed to correct known and documented minor attributing errors and additional fields were incorporated including a unique numerical identifier (SWFor_ID). \n\nWebb et al. (2016) reviewed the 1:50,000 mapping of the Whicher Scarp and changes were made to ensure the complexes were a continuation of those defined by Mattiske and Havel (1998) and the extent of the landform correlated to that as defined by soil-landscape mapping (DAFWA 2007). In addition the review consolidated the boundaries along the Whicher and Darling Scarp interface with the Swan Coastal Plain. All Swan Coastal Plain complexes were removed and incorporated into the 2016 mapping of the “Swan Coastal Plain Vegetation Complexes” (Webb et al. 2016). ",

    "description": "The Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network (ACORN) facility comprises a coordinated network of HF radars delivering real-time, non-quality controlled and delayed-mode, quality controlled surface current data into a national archive. \n\nBased on experience in Europe and the USA, deployment of these radars is expected to make a profound change to coastal ocean research in Australia. HF radar provides unprecedented time-resolved surface current maps over the monitoring sites for physical and biological ocean research. \n\nDeployment of the radars is in support of regional nodes where there is a range of identified questions concerned with boundary currents and associated eddies and their interactions with shelf water and topography. In turn these are linked to productivity, connectivity of biological populations and phenomena such as coral bleaching and diseases. It provides a basis for applied research in wave prediction and offers test sites for hydrodynamic modelling. \n\nThe equipment comprises long-range WERA and medium-range WERA systems and long-range SeaSonde systems, and associated spares and transport infrastructure. An existing system that was installed by James Cook University in the Capricorn/Bunker region around Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef was integrated into the network. An HF radar acquisition by a consortium led by South Australian Research and Development Institute in South Australia was also integrated into the network.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

It is a dynamic dataset that will change over time and be reviewed every year. It is also important to note that an Incident Control Site whether it be a fixed or field ICC site can also be used as an Operations Point or Staging Area. DBCA does not purport that the information contained in this shapefile represents the only sites/all sites that are potentially available to be used as FFICC-Fixed Facility Incident Control Centre, FICCS- Field Incident Control Centre Sites. It is however a good guide for managers to determine a management site when required. ",

    "description": "Between 1921 and 1977 twelve anthropologists worked in coastal communities of Arnhem Land in Australia's Northern Territory, researching and writing about land tenure, among other things, yet not one of them mentioned the existence of a system of customary marine tenure (for the resulting publications see: Tindale 1925-6; Warner 1937; Worsley 1954; Berndt 1964,1970,1976; Rose 1960; Hiatt 1965; Shapiro 1969; Turner 1974; Meehan 1982; Morphy 1991; Keen 1994;Williams 1986). Some of them such as Ronald Berndt (1976) actually mapped sites in the sea. Today there is a well developed and dynamic system of indigenous marine tenure along the Arnhem Land Coast. This lack of visibility raises a number of questions including how old these systems are and why if they have any antiquity they have not been more visible.",

The data is based on modified 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n\nAPY Lands (SA2 code 41138) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (N) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=3\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 3 in this dataset.\n\n\nAPY Lands (SA2 code 41138) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (%) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=90\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 90 in this dataset.\n\n",

    "title": "Warra Flux Data Release 2024_v2",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\n<em>Eucalyptus obliqua</em> forests dominate the vegetation below 650&nbsp;m where they exist as fire-maintained communities. On fertile soils these forests attain mature heights in excess of 55&nbsp;m: the tallest <em>E. obliqua</em> reaches a height of 90&nbsp;m. The flux station is installed in a stand of tall, mixed-aged <em>E. obliqua</em> forest (77 and &gt;250 years-old) with a rainforest understorey and a dense man-fern (<em>Dicksonia antarctica</em>) ground-layer, on a small flat of elevation 100&nbsp;m adjacent to the Huon River. The understorey vegetation progresses from wet sclerophyll (dominated by <em>Pomaderris apatala</em> and <em>Acacia dealbata</em>) to rainforest (dominated by <em>Nothofagus cunninghamii</em>, <em>Atherosperma moschatum</em>, <em>Eucryphia lucida</em> and <em>Phyllocladus aspleniifolius</em>) with increasing time intervals between fire events. The site supports prodigous quantities of coarse woody debris as is characteristic of these fire-maintained eucalypt forests on fertile sites in southern Tasmania. The soil at the flux site is derived from Permian mudstone and has a gradational profile with a dark brown organic clayey silt topsoil overlying a yellow brown clay. The climate is classified as temperate with a mild summer and no dry season. Mean annual precipitation is 1700&nbsp;mm with a relatively uniform seasonal distribution. Summer temperatures peak in January (8.4&nbsp;°C to 19.2&nbsp;°C) with winter temperatures reaching their lowest in July (2.6&nbsp;°C to 8.4&nbsp;°C).\n\nThe instruments are mounted at the top of an 80&nbsp;m tall guyed steel lattice tower. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation. An open-path gas analyser (EC150) was replaced by a closed-path gas analyser (EC155) at the end of January 2015. Soil moisture content is measured using time domain reflectometry. Soil heat fluxes and temperature are also measured. Micro-meteorology (CO2, H2O, energy fluxes) and meteorology (temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rainfall) were measured from 2013 to late 2016, but the dataset is incomplete due to ongoing problems since changing the open-path IRGA to a closed path system (CPEC200) during 2015. Soil data (moisture, heat flux, temperature) are complete for the time period.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is an extract for the Hunter subregion of the soil thickness data from the ASRIS Continental-scale soil property predictions 2001. The source data are the Surface of predicted Thickness of soil layer 1 (A Horizon - top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.  Data modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State and CSIRO and presented as .0.01 degree grid cells. \n\n\n\nThe dataset consists of statistics for soils depths (MIN, MAX, RANGE, MEAN, STD, MEDIAN) for each of the simulation catchments in the AWRA-L model. The soil thickness data were resampled to the model grid (BILO cells - 0.05 degree grid cells) and the catchments are defined by the BILO cells which fall within them. The gauging station ID in the spreadsheet defines the gauges which were used to define the upstream catchment area.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nUsed to define soils thickness in the AWRA-L model.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe soil thickness data were resampled to the model grid (BILO cells - 0.05 degree grid cells). Statistics for soils depths (MIN, MAX, RANGE, MEAN, STD, MEDIAN) for each of the simulation catchments in the AWRA-L model were calculated using the Zonal Statistics as Table tool within ArcGIS with the simulation catchments used as the zone dataset.

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 6.1 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia.  85 biogeographic regions and 405 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia.  \nThe IBRA Version 6.1 data consists of two datasets.  IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. \n\nIBRA Version 6.1 is the result of refinement of the IBRA Version 5.1 and version 6.0 boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories and also based on alterations by the states/territories along the state borders.  The refined boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies.  Those jurisdictions to refine their data in this version of IBRA include New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.  There are 53 newly named sub regions and 5 have been renamed from version 5.1.  Whilst there has been a refinement of sub-regional and associated bioregional boundaries in Qld, Vic and western NSW, the new sub-regions are found principally in eastern NSW.  In WA changes relate to moving the western boundary of Yalgoo bioregion to the coast, truncating the northern portion of the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion.\n\nNominal attributes that make up IBRA are: climate, lithology/geology, landform, vegetation, flora and fauna, and landuse.  The use of these attributes varies across the jurisdictions and for further information individual jurisdictions should be contacted.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.

    "description": "Crabs sometimes vacate their territories due to continued harassment by their neighbours. To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. 20 Focal males were selected: 10 with male nearest neighbours and 10 with female nearest neighbours. The following day, at the same time relative to low tide, we determined whether the crabs were in the same burrows. Data recorded included: the tidal height and time, and whether each crab was present or not. A new set of 20 pairs were marked each day over a period of 26 days. \n\nThe data suggests the crabs were less likely to change burrows during neap tides. Males with female neighbours also tended to be more stable than males with male neighbours.",

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual retained catch (meaning the catch that is not returned to the sea) in kilograms, by species and fishery, for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea, where generally the weights are estimates only. Fish discarded at sea are not included in this dataset. Location of catches within a fishery is not included.\r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Fishers usually cannot accurately weigh fish at sea, so the estimated weights are mostly based on volume (i.e. the size and number of boxes of fish caught). Catch data are used in combination with gear, effort, and spatial data to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may filter out catches from their assessments because of data quality issues or group species differently. In addition, the data may be different in other datasets with different summations such as catch by season or catch from the date fish were landed at port.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect catches each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as: total allowable catch, closures of fishing areas, reducing boat numbers, or banning the catch of a particular species. Similarly, changes in market demand can affect which species are targeted. \r\nWhen the fish are landed at port, the accurate weight of fish is recorded in AFMA catch disposal records by both the fisher and fish receiver permit holder. This information can be found in the “Reported landed annual catch from Commonwealth fisheries catch disposal records” and its metadata, which is published on data.gov.au. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in the species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness, and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "Counting perinatal deaths - Various definitions are used for reporting and registering perinatal deaths in Australia. The National Perinatal Data Collection defines perinatal deaths as all fetal deaths (stillbirths) and neonatal deaths (deaths of liveborn babies aged less than 28 days) of at least 400 grams birthweight or at least 20 weeks’ gestation. Fetal and neonatal deaths may include late termination of pregnancy (20 weeks or more gestation). Perinatal and fetal death rates are calculated using all live births and stillbirths in the denominator. Neonatal death rates are calculated using live births only. Neonatal deaths may not be included for babies transferred to another hospital, re-admitted to hospital after discharge or who died at home after discharge. The AIHW has established a separate National Perinatal Mortality Data Collection to capture complete information on these deaths. The latest report is available from the AIHW website.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found here > https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mothers-babies/australias-mothers-and-babies-2018-in-brief/contents/table-of-contents\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttps://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mothers-babies/australias-mothers-babies-data-visualisations/contents/stillbirths-and-neonatal-deaths",

    "description": "(Abstract from 'The ducks of Macquarie Island')\n\nEarly reference to waterfowl on Macquarie Island and observations made by ANARE expeditioners between 1949 and 1985 are reviewed and discussed.  Apart from a unique (perhaps erroneous) record of a mute swan Cygnus olor, information is restricted to the Pacific black duck Anas superciliosa, the grey teal A. gibberifrons and the alien mallard A. platyrhynchos and its hybrids.\n\nBlack duck and grey teal were seen by early visitors to the Island, but despite the infrequent potential for escapes of domestic ducks, mallards were not recorded until 1949.  Occasional teal and mallards were seen in the years following the establishment of the permanent scientific station (1948) but mallards (and hybrids) have become more numerous in recent years.  Though grey teal may disperse to Macquarie Island in times of drought on the Australian mainland, the source of mallards may be New Zealand or the less distant Campbell and Auckland Islands.\n\nThe few available records of breeding (eggs, ducklings and nests) for black duck suggest that laying begins in September and extends at least into January.  Zooplankton is most abundant in spring and summer, but ducks may obtain high protein foods from the littoral and sublittoral areas and may also take seeds of terrestrial plants.\n\nAvailable information does not allow separation of habitats used by black duck or mallards.  However, most observations are around coastal areas.  There is some indication that records have increased along the south-western and eastern sides of the Island, but generally there are few observations of either species on the higher, central plateau.\n\nThe intrusion of mallards onto the Island and the resultant hybridisation with black duck poses a threat for the future integrity of the latter native species.\n\nThis dataset contains a review of the data available for Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and grey teal (Anas gibberifrons) and hybrids on Macquarie Island, collected from mid-1949 to January 1985. There is a period of relatively continuous and extensive data between February 1963 and January 1985. Discussion and references about habitat, breeding, feeding and hybrids is provided in the dataset (see the reference), as well as distribution maps.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nYear\n\nMonth\n\nPresence/Absence",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1990 to February 1991. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

These data were obtained from four sets of spatially replicated site-types: (1) a chronosequence of 29 passive regrowth sites (1-67 years) on previously forested land with a subsequent period of land use for agriculture (e.g. cropping or grazing); (2) a comparable chronosequence of 25 actively planted sites (1-25 years); (3) five pasture reference sites, indicating the pre-reforestation condition; and (4) eight rainforest reference sites indicating the target of reforestation. The reference sites provide a context for interpreting the developmental trajectories of reforested sites. Development trajectories are measured using a range of structural and floristic attributes.\n\nThe primary purpose for collecting this data was to: \n(1) evaluate time lags and uncertainty of recovery for different elements of tropical forest (i.e. structure, biomass, species density and community composition) through passive regrowth and active planting; \n(2) identify forest attributes that are particularly slow to develop under either approach; \n(3) explore ecological explanations for the later that might suggest barriers to recovery and inform modifications to current restoration practices to catalyse outcomes.\n\nThe study was conducted in wet tropics uplands of the south-central Atherton Tableland, north eastern Australia (17°10´ ¿ 17°35´S, 145°30´ ¿ 145°45´E). Field surveys in ecological restoration plantings and reference sites (pasture and forest) were completed between May 2008 and August 2009. Comparative assessments of regrowth sites were conducted between October 2012 and June 2013.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nVegetation structure and floristic composition at each site were measured within two 50 x 20 m transects (combined for analysis as one 100 m transect), using an established monitoring protocol (Kanowski et al. 2010).\n\nFour types of structural attribute were quantified: canopy cover, canopy height, wood volume and woody stem density. Canopy cover (%) and height (m) were averaged across six 10 x 10 m quadrats, centred 5, 25, 45, 55, 75 and 95 m along the transect. Stems of all trees and shrubs (free-standing woody-stemmed plants, henceforth ¿TS¿) >1.0 m tall were counted in variable-width transects, according to the following dbh categories (cm): <2.5, 2.5-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-75, 75-100, >100. Transect widths were 5, 10 and 20 m respectively for stem dbh categories <10, 10-50, and >50 cm, giving respective areas surveyed of 500, 1,000, and 2,000 m2. \n\nPresence of special life forms (i.e. vines, epiphytes and ferns), canopy cover and canopy height were assessed within three 10 x 10 m quadrats centred on the 5, 25 and 45 m points of each transect. Aboveground biomass of live trees and shrubs was calculated from site-specific stem data together with assumed average wood densities from Kanowski et al. (2010b).\n\nData on forest attributes were pooled for each site. Estimates of stem density and species density of freestanding trees and shrubs were further partitioned according to species origin, dispersal mode and diaspore size (seeds plus any additional tissues that assist in dispersal) and membership to near-basal plant families. Origin was simply native or non-native. We considered separately species dependent on either of two important dispersal vectors. These were ¿wind dispersed¿ and ¿bird or bat dispersed¿. The later did not include non-volant (non-flying) vertebrates and invertebrates such as cassowary, musky-rat kangaroo, rodents, pigs and ants. For animal dispersed plant taxa, we further differentiated between those species with small diaspores (< 10 mm) and moderate to large diaspores (> 10 mm) to reflect important variation in frugivore capacity (Moran & Catterall 2010). Near-basal plant families followed the assessment of Metcalfe and Ford (2009) derived from current molecular phylogeny of angiosperms. This focus on plant families with ancient origins is in recognition of their importance to the ¿outstanding universal value¿ of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and is relevant to ongoing management targeted at conserving evolutionary history. \n\nFurther details can be found in this publication: \nSHOO, L.

    "description": "<strong>Important notes for interpretation</strong>\n\n<strong>Factors influencing exposure</strong>: High mosquito numbers do not always lead to an increase in human arbovirus cases. Other factors, such as weather, human behaviour, and the use of protective measures, can affect the risk of exposure to mosquito-borne viruses.\n\n<strong>Trapping locations</strong>: Locations on maps reflect the mid-point of sites within a broader location, not exact mosquito trap sites (as some trapping sites are located on private properties).\n\n<strong>Seasonal variation</strong>: Some locations may consistently experience higher mosquito numbers throughout a season while others may have lower numbers and others may have sudden increases in mosquito numbers at points during the season. There may also be variability in mosquito numbers between seasons.\n\n<strong>Positive test results</strong>: For mosquito traps, a detection represents the presence of virus in at least one mosquito in a sample of trapped mosquitoes. For sentinel chickens, a positive test result means that one or more chickens in a flock have tested positive for antibodies directed against a particular virus for the first time, suggesting a newly acquired infection. Infection in chickens gives an indication that there is enough virus to transmit to humans.",

    "description": "###Introduction\r\nTraining.gov.au (TGA) is the National Register of Vocational Education and Training in Australia and contains authoritative information about Registered Training Organisations (RTOs), Nationally Recognised Training (NRT) and the approved scope of each RTO to deliver NRT as required in national and jurisdictional legislation.\r\n\r\n###TGA web-services overview\r\nTGA has a web service available to allow external systems to access and utilise information stored in TGA through an external system. The TGA web service is exposed through a single interface and web service users are assigned a data reader role which will apply to all data stored in the TGA.\r\n\r\nThe web service can be broadly split into three categories:\r\n\r\n1.   RTOs and other organisation types;\r\n\r\n2.   Training components including Accredited courses, Accredited course  Modules Training Packages, Qualifications, Skill Sets and Units of Competency;\r\n\r\n3.   System metadata including static data and statistical classifications.\r\n\r\nUsers will gain access to the TGA web service by first passing a user name and password through to the web server.  The web server will then authenticate the user against the TGA security provider before passing the request to the application that supplies the web services.\r\n\r\nThere are **two web services environments:**\r\n\r\n**1.   Production - ws.training.gov.au** – National Register production web services\r\n\r\n**2.   Sandbox  - ws.sandbox.training.gov.au** – National Register sandbox web services.  \r\n\r\nThe National Register sandbox web service is used to test against the current version of the web services where the functionality will be identical to the current production release.  The web service definition and schema of the National Register sandbox database will also be identical to that of production release at any given point in time.  The National Register sandbox database will be cleared down at regular intervals and realigned with the National Register production environment.\r\n\r\nEach environment has three configured services:\r\n\r\n1.   Organisation Service;\r\n\r\n2.   Training Component Service; and\r\n\r\n3.   Classification Service.\r\n\r\n###Sandbox environment access\r\nTo access the download area for web services, navigate to http://tga.hsd.com.au  and use the below name and password:\r\n\r\n**Username:** WebService.Read (case sensitive)\r\n\r\n**Password:** Asdf098 (case sensitive)\r\n\r\nThis download area contains various versions of the following artefacts that you may find useful\r\n\r\n•   Training.gov.au web service specification document;\r\n\r\n•   Training.gov.au logical data model and definitions document;\r\n\r\n•   .NET web service SDK sample app (with source code);\r\n\r\n•   Java sample client (with source code);\r\n\r\n•   How to setup web service client in VS 2010 video; and\r\n\r\n•   Web services WSDL's and XSD's.\r\n\r\nFor the business areas, the specification/definition documents and the sample application is a good place to start while the IT areas will find the sample source code and the video useful to start developing against the TGA web services.\r\n\r\nThe web services Sandbox end point is: https://ws.sandbox.training.gov.au/Deewr.Tga.Webservices  \r\n\r\n###Production web service access\r\nOnce you are ready to access the production web service, please email the TGA team at *[tgaproject@education.gov.au](mailto:tgaproject@education.gov.au)* to obtain a unique **user name** and **password**.\r\n",

    "description": "The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2014 provides both spatial and text information about government, Indigenous and privately protected areas for continental Australia. State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current to 30 June 2014. The terrestrial component of the database has been previously released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 2010 and 2012.\n\nThis version, provides both spatial and text information about off-shore protected areas in both state and Commonwealth waters.  State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current for 30 June 2014. This is the seventh version of the CAPAD- Marine database, with previous versions published in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008 2010 and 2012. \n\nCAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area:\n\n\"A protected area is an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means\" (IUCN 1994).\n\nThe Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy (DOE) publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad\n\n This version of CAPAD 2014-Marine is a public / downloadable dataset available for use through the CC-BY licencing model. \n\nCommercial users: Commercial users should note the availability of a more descriptive dataset for Commonwealth Marine Reserves. It is recommended for use in commercial applications as it includes additional information about management arrangements for Commonwealth Marine Reserves.

Until the new management plans come into effect transitional management arrangements are in place. Under these transitional arrangements, there are no changes \"on the water\" for users in the new areas added to the Commonwealth marine reserve estate. If people hold an existing approval to undertake activities within Commonwealth marine reserves or the now-revoked Coral Sea Conservation Zone, they are able to continue to operate under the terms of the existing approval. No additional administrative requirements apply.\n\nThe management plan for the South-east Network came into effect on 1 July 2013 with the management plans for the South-west, North-west, North and Temperate East Networks and the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve are under review.

    "title": "MBRC Planning Scheme - Rural Residential Lot Size Overlay",
    "description": "<b>Version 29 January 2020</b>\nThe Rural Residential Lot Sizes Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",
