Important results published in our 53-page Phys. Rev. X paper (2021) include the first measurements of higher-order light-propagation effects and of the relativistic deformation of the orbit and highlight the importance of a long term observational campaign, including VLBI observations, for this remarkable system. The main aims of this proposal are to provide the strongest tests to date for general relativity and to measure for the first time the moment-of-inertia of a neutron star. Additionally, we will determine the system geometry, map the pulsar beams via geodetic precession, and search for the reappearance of Pulsar B. We exploit the high sensitivity and broad bandwidth of the UWL receiver. We are collaborating with the MeerKAT Double Pulsar Timing team to optimise combination of MeerKAT and UWL data.",

Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2017 car parking event data there are 3,858 records where the parking event goes into 2018 and ends at midnight.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/u9sa-j86i.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.13GB, 35.9 million rows)",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

Two sites WB 72 and WB73 were located by way of x and y coordinates supplied by GPS survey. Site WB 30 was located by local knowledge of the sites. Location of bores should fall within accuracy ± 20m.\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.  \n\nEach mooring is equipped with surface CO2 systems, using proven and robust technology.  Three sensors will determine surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. \n\nAcidification moorings are co-located at three National Reference Stations:\n* the Yongala NRS in Queensland (replaced in September 2013 after Tropical Cyclone Yasi) (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and a WETLabs WQM)\n* the Maria Island NRS in Tasmania (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT), and\n* the Kangaroo Island NRS in South Australia (removed in June 2013, and redeployed in May 2014) (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT).  \n\nA fourth acidification mooring is located adjacent to the Heron Island reef slope in the Wistari channel on the Great Barrier Reef (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT).  \n\nThe Yongala, Wistari and Maria Island acidification moorings are located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean.  The Kangaroo Island mooring monitors the deeper waters upwelled on the South Australian shelf which are expected to have higher CO2 and thus could accelerate the exposure of ecosystems to acidification earlier than in other regions.",

Data may change over time as agencies undertake data quality assurance processes or as contract information is varied. Please refer to the tenders website below for the latest of each week.**\n\n**Note: **As part of the implementation of the new Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs), Procurement Method descriptions for Contract and Standing Offer Notices reported on AusTender changed, effective 1 July 2012. Open, Select and Direct are now Open Tender, Prequalified Tender, and Limited Tender, respectively. For Contract Notice Export files extracted prior to 1 July 2012, Procurement Method descriptions are unchanged.\n\nSource of information at [http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.lis\ntCNWeeklyExport](http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.listCNWeeklyE\nxport)\n\n**UPDATE:** Now below is also the current list of goods and services category codes used by Australian Government agencies to code their open approaches to market and contracts awarded for publication on AusTender. The codeset is a subset of the United Nations Standard Product and Services Code (UNSPSC) and is reviewed and updated periodically. Code numbers starting with the prefixes **43 a Information Technology, Broadcasting and Telecommunications** and **81 a Engineering and Research and Technology Based Services** apply in the main to Information and Communications Technology related contracts, primarily ICT goods and services respectively.\n\n_Please note: we will make an API available to this dataset in the near\nfuture_.\n\n",

    "title": "Australian lamb: Financial performance of lamb producers, 2013-14 to 2015-16 - Research report 16.9",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for lamb producers for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Lamb producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that sold, on average, 200 or more lambs for slaughter a year over the three years ending 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income of lamb producing farms rose on average over the period 2013-14 to 2014-15. The majority of the rise in farm incomes came from higher beef and lamb receipts due to increased prices and sales for both commodities. Average farm cash income of lamb producing farms is estimated to have increased further in 2015-16 mainly as a result of increased crop, wool and beef cattle sales. \r\n• Average incomes of lamb producing farms are estimated to have risen from 2014-15 to 2015-16 in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The majority of the increase in farm incomes in these states was from higher cropping receipts. \r\n• In real terms, the estimated average farm incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 were among the highest recorded since 2001-02. \r\n• Rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for lamb producers fell marginally from 2.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 2.5 per cent in 2014-15. The average rate of return is estimated to have increased in 2015-16 to around 3.0 per cent, reflecting higher incomes. \r\n• Average debt for lamb producers increased in real terms by around 88 per cent from $323 000 in 2000-01 (in 2015-16 dollars) to an estimated $605 000 in 2015-16. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of increases in average farm size and borrowing for land purchase, as well as for ongoing working capital. \r\n• Overall, changes in average debt over time have been modest relative to lamb producers' capacity to service debt by generating income. On average, around 8 per cent of lamb producers' farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments over the 10 years to 2015-16. In 2015-16 an estimated 6 per cent of farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments. \r\n",

    "description": "AUV Sirius (IMOS Platform code: SIRIUS) was deployed near Batemans Bay in New South Wales, November 2011.\n\nDives in New South Wales were coordinated around existing BRUVs locations maintained by DECCW and the Batemans' Bay MPA.  Broad grids and dense patch surveys were completed at each site, although an issue with the vessel, a fault with the vehicle’s battery and weather meant that not all sites were completed at Port Stephens.  We are looking to complete these in early 2011.The 2010/11 period has predominantly been spent establishing benthic reference sites at numerous sites around Australia using the AUV.\n\nThe SIRIUS overtook 13 dives and travelled for 36 kms. 79296 stereo pairs images were captured every around each 40cm at an average altitude of 2.2m.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trip the dataset included over 1TB of geotiff imagery, multibeam, AUV tracks, 3D textured meshes and hydrographical data (CDOM, Salinity, Temperature, .\n\nThe dive reports from this campaign summarise AUV activity during each dive.",

    "description": "This record describes the CTD data collected on Investigator voyage IN2025_V04, titled: \"Untangling the causes of change over 25 years in the southeast marine ecosystem - Voyage IV (SEA-MES Voyage 4).\" The voyage took place between May 27, 2025 and June 28, 2025 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart.\nData for 61 CTD deployments were acquired using the Sea-Bird SBE911 CTD unit #22, fitted with 36 twelve-litre bottles on the rosette sampler. Sea-Bird-supplied calibration factors were used to compute the pressures and preliminary conductivity values. CSIRO-supplied calibrations were applied to the temperature data. The data were subjected to automated QC to remove spikes and out-of-range values.\nMajority of casts were bottom approaches to 10m off bottom, some casts did not approach the bottom due to the operators deciding that conditions were too risky to attempt a bottom approach. The test cast was not attempted due to strong winds, hence cast #01 was a scientific cast.\nCast #61 no SUNA data is available for this cast.\nBetween cast #35 and #36 the pumped sensors were cleaned with freshwater. This did not affect the conductivity sensor but did the oxygen sensor, hence the final calibrations were based on a single deployment group for conductivity and multiple deployment groupings for oxygen. The final conductivity calibration from the secondary sensor had a standard deviation (SD) of 0.0030364 PSU, outside our target of ‘better than 0.002 PSU’. The standard product of 1-decibar binned averages were produced using data from the secondary sensors. The dissolved oxygen data calibration fit had a SD of 0.68397μM (#01-#35) and 0.79591μM (#36-#61). The agreement between the CTD and bottle data was good.\nPAR, CDOM, Transmissometer, Chlorophyll-a and Scattering sensors were also installed on the auxiliary A/D channels of the CTD.\nThe collected data were processed (quality-controlled), and subsequently archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).\nAdditional information regarding this dataset may be contained in the Voyage Summary and the Data Processing Report.",

    "title": "Photosynthetic and growth responses in three tropical seagrass species to pCO2 enrichment (440, 700, 890, 1204 µatm) (NERP TE 5.2, AIMS)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of one data file (spreadsheet) from a 2 week aquarium experiment manipulating pH (pCO2) changes and measuring photosynthetic and growth responses of three tropical seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii). \n\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased pCO2 would increase photosynthetic and growth rates to various extents between seagrass species.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nThis experiment exposed three seagrass species, Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii, to four pCO2 treatments (440, 700, 890, 1204 µatm) for two weeks to investigate the effects of acidification on their physiology. These treatments were chosen to bracket the range of atmospheric CO2 levels predicted for different end-of-century emission scenarios in the near-future (2100). Each treatment was replicated across four aquaria, each with 2 duplicate pots per species.\n\nC. serrulata and H. uninervis were collected from the intertidal meadow at Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef (19°10.88¿S, 146°50.63¿E) in late March 2013. T. hemprichii was collected from Green Island in the Northern Great Barrier Reef (16°45.37¿S, 145°58.19¿E) in early April 2013. H. uninervis and sediment was collected as intact plugs. C. serrulata and T. hemprichii were collected by excavating intact shoots with connected horizontal rhizomes from the sediment. The experiment started two to four weeks after the collection.\n\nPhotosynthetic rates and respiration of the second youngest leaf of a haphazardly chosen shoot from each pot were measured using optical oxygen sensors. Photosynthetic rates were measured over a series of light steps (10, 30, 70, 110, 220, 400, 510 µmol m-2 s-1), with each light step lasting 20 minutes. Rates were normalised to the dry weight of the leaf, after drying leaves at 60°C for 48 hours. To determine photosynthetic parameters (Pmax, alpha, Ek, Ec), photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-E) data plots were fitted to the adapted hyperbolic tangent model equation of Jassby and Platt (1976). Net productivity (NP) was taken to be the photosynthetic rate measured at the experimental light level (400 µmol m-2 s-1). Energetic surplus (PG:R) was calculated as the ratio of gross productivity to dark respiration rate. \n\nTo measure growth rates, all shoots were marked at the top of the sheath with a needle at the start of the experiment. After 14 days, the shoots were harvested, the length of new tissue growth were excised, dried at 60°C for 48 hours and weighed for determination of weight of new leaf growth. Leaf tissue growth was normalised to the aboveground biomass to derive relative leaf growth rates (RGR). Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated by dividing total leaf area with the total biomass of the leaves.\n\nChlorophyll content was determined by acetone extraction of chlorophyll from a young mature leaf from each pot at the end of the experiment. \nTo determine non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content, roots and rhizomes were dried at 60°C for 48 hours, before being homogenised. Soluble carbohydrates were extracted with 80% ethanol at 80°C. The amount of soluble carbohydrates was assayed after removal of phenolic compounds and acid hydrolysis. Starch content was analysed from the residue of the soluble carbohydrate extraction through enzyme (amylase and amyloglucosidase) digestion. The concentration of glucose is measured using a commercially available glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) testing reagent (Megazyme). Absorbance was then measured at 510 nm. Total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content was the sum of the amount of soluble carbohydrates and starch content.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nComma Separated File (CSV)\n\n\nData Dictionary:\n\nseagrass_pCO2only.csv:\n\n- pH: Average of the calculated pH of the aquarium over the experimental period.\n- pCO2 (uatm): average pCO2 levels over two weeks.\n- Temp_real (oC): Average of measured temperatures of the aquarium over the experimental period (N=3). These were measured manually.\n- N_sampling: Number of water samples taken for pCO2 and pH determinations\n- Species: ¿CS¿= Cymodocea serrulata, ¿HU¿= Halodule uninervis, ¿TH¿= Thalassia hemprichii\n- Aquaria: ID of the aquarium each pot was kept in.\n- Duplicate_pot: ID of duplicate pot of species in each aquaria \n- Resp (mgO2 g-1DW h-1): dark respiration rates of leaf from haphazardly choosen shoot from pot\n- Productivity (mgO2 g-1DW h-1): photosynthetic rates measured under experimental treatment light level (400 µmol m-2 s-1), measured after 14 days.\n- alpha: photosynthetic efficiency of shoot, calculated from the linear slope of fitted hyperbolic tangent curve (Jassby and Platt, 1976)  P=P_max×tanh((alpha P_max)/E)\n- Ec (µmol m-2 s-1): Light level at which photosynthetic rate is equal to the dark respiration rate.\n- Ek (µmol m-2 s-1): Light level at which photosynthetic rate reaches maximal photosynthetic rate (Pmax).\n- Pmax (mgO2 g-1DW h-1): maximum photosynthetic rates, derived from fitted curve (shown above).\n- Pg:R_ratio: ratio of gross photosynthetic rate (Productivity+Resp) to dark respiration rates.\n- Chl_a (mg g-1FW): chlorophyll a content per gram fresh weight leaf tissue.\n- Chl_b (mg g-1FW): chlorophyll b content per gram fresh weight leaf tissue.\n- Growth (mg sht-1 d-1): increase in leaf biomass per pot, averaged over duration of experiment (14days) and normalise to number of shoots in pot.\n- RGR (g g-1 d-1): relative growth rate. Increase in leaf biomass per pot, averaged over duration of experiment (14days) and normalised to aboveground biomass in pot.\n- Specific leaf area: Total leaf area extended divided by the total biomass of the leaves.\n- SolCarbs (mg g-1DW): Soluble carbohydrates content per unit dry weight of rhizome tissue. Only 4 reps were analysed, i.e. 1 per aquaria.  \n- Starch (mg g-1DW): Starch content per unit dry weight of rhizome tissue. Only 4 reps were analysed, i.e. 1 per aquaria.\n- NSC (mg g-1DW): Total non-structural carbohydrates content per unit dry weight of rhizome tissue. Only 4 reps were analysed, i.e. 1 per aquaria.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from the Gloucester Deep Wells Completion Reports - Geology dataset (GUID: 0529ae9a-4d40-460d-b52a-fb0e5f646746). The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe data set consists of two files which correspond to the wells location and data (formation markers) used to identify the depth of formations used in the geologic model. \n\n\n\nFiles:\n\nWell_picks.txt\n\n\n\nContains the well name, datum and the calculated depths of formations form the datum identified from the well completion reports.\n\n\n\nWells_locations.kmz \n\n\n\nContains the locations for use in GoogleEarth.  Geographic coordinates are available in the original well completion reports.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nData were extracted from 25 well completion reports obtained for the Gloucester basin from the DIGS database.  Each report lists the depth of the various formations encountered during well drilling and the elevation at the surface.  Using these values the formation tops and bottoms were calculated and formatted accordingly for input into the geological model.  The file well_picks.txt represents the input data.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) GLO Deep Well Locations and Depths of Formations V01.

    "description": "    \n\nThis statistical table brings together aggregate data for banks, credit\nunions, building societies, corporations covered by the Financial Sector\n(Collection of Data) Act 2001 (known as Registered Financial Corporations\n(RFCs)) and other significant parts of the financial sector for which\naggregate data are published by the RBA, the ABS and APRA.\n\nCare should be exercised in drawing conclusions about relative sizes and rates\nof growth of institutions because of the different nature of their activities\nand different coverage of the various data collections. Coverage differences\ninclude: timing (e.g. most bank data are monthly averages until June 2000 and\nend-month thereafter); valuation; location (e.g. life office data before 1988\nonly covers assets in Australia, most other collections include overseas\nassets); and netting out of transactions within some groups. Coverage of some\nseries changes over time: in recent years aggregates for individual groups\nhave been significantly affected by conversion of non-banks to banks,\nreclassification between RFC categories and changes to reporting forms. Some\nfurther details of coverage can be obtained from statistical files dealing\nwith the relevant institutions.\n\naReserve Bank (RBA)a data for June 1996 adjusted for change in accounting\npolicy.\n\naBanks (other than RBA)a: up to 1985 inclusive refers to A$ assets in\nAustralia only. From 1989 equals the totals shown in statistical table B2.\n\naOther authorised deposit-taking institutionsa excludes some ADIs, including\nSCCIs. Data from December 1999 inclusive are drawn from APRAas quarterly\nreturn. These data will differ from the total assets figures presented in\nstatistical tables B7 and B8 because they include assets of all building\nsocieties and credit unions, whereas statistical tables B7 and B8 only include\ndata for building societies and credit unions with total assets greater than\nor equal to $50 million.\n\nFrom December 1999 data, aRFCsa cover registered corporations whose assets in\nAustralia (including related corporations) exceed $50 million. Prior to\nDecember 1999, this threshold was set at $5 million. In April 2003,\nresponsibility for the collection of financial statistics from RFCs was\ntransferred from the RB to APRA. Prior to April 2003, these data were\ncollected by the RB under the now repealed Financial Corporations Act 1974.\nThese changes have resulted in breaks in all series covering RFCs at April\n2003. aFinance companies and general financiersa includes corporations\nformerly registered as Category E (Pastoral Finance Companies), F (Finance\nCompanies) and G (General Financiers) under the Financial Corporations Act\n1974.\n\nThe assets of life offices and superannuation funds and other managed funds\nhave been consolidated by the ABS. As a result, these data should not be\ncompared to statistical tables B14aB18, which contain unconsolidated data.\n\naGeneral insurance officesa include both private and public sector offices.\nData are sourced from the ABS Financial Accounts and relate to financial\nassets only.\n\naSecuritisation vehiclesa (commonly referred to as issuers of asset-backed\nsecurities) are special purpose vehicles set up to securitise selected assets,\nincluding residential mortgages. Many of the securities issued by these\nvehicles are held by other institutions shown in the table. More detailed data\nare shown in statistical table B19.\n\n",

    "description": "Indicators help us to assess our municipality's performance, measure progress and compare with other cities. The results also help us monitor our Council Plan and guide policy, planning and management to ensure that Melbourne continues to be a liveable, bold, inspirational and sustainable city.\n\nA visual representation of the indicators presented here can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/research-and-statistics/Pages/Liveability.aspx\">online visualisation.</a> The indicators are from a select list we collect for the following two main activities: \n\n1. The City of Melbourne Social Indicator Survey (CoMSIS) provides insight into the health, wellbeing, participation and connection of residents in our city. This data is collected to directly address some of the Council Plan’s municipal outcome indicators and support our health and wellbeing priorities. Findings of the survey give insight into the perceived quality of life for our residents.\n\n2. The <a href=\"https://www.dataforcities.org/wccd/\">World Council on City Data (WCCD)</a> is a network of cities committed to improving services and quality of life with open city data and standardised urban indicators. The WCCD developed and oversees an international standard for city data: <i>ISO 37120 Sustainable Development of Communities: Indicators for City Services and Quality of Life.</i> The City of Melbourne is a member of this network and annually submits indicators for verification in accordance with this standard.\n\nRelated datasets: <b><a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/social-indicators-for-city-of-melbourne-residents-2018/information/\">Social Indicators for City of Melbourne Residents 2018</a></b>",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "title": "Current meter and tide gauge data obtained from an off-shore mooring near Jervis Bay: 05/04/89 - 07/12/89",
    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed in 100m of water, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular, Jervis Bay. This mooring housed 3 current meters (at 30m, 55m and 90m water depth) and also a tide gauge. Over a period of approx. 8 months the mooring was deployed 3 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1 - 35.16 S, 150.817 E. \nDeployments 2 & 3 - 35.1267 S, 150.825 E. Datasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the three current meters over the study period.\n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 3 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2 & 3) for the upper two meters at 30m and 55m water depth. The current meter at 90m utilised sampling intervals of 10mins (deployments 1 & 2) and 30mins (deployment 3). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 11/4/89 - 5/6/89... 2) 28/7/89 - 29/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 29/11/89\n\nTIDE GAUGE: The tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~100m for all three deployments  In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Almost two thirds of convicts were English (along with a small number of Scottish and Welsh), with the Irish making up the remaining one third.\nConvicts were usually given sentences of transportation for seven, 14 years or life. Some convicts in the 1830s received ten-year sentences. About one quarter of the convicts were sentenced to ‘the term of their natural lives’, and a proportion of these had reprieves from the death sentence.\nThese seven indexes contain around 140,000 entries in total.",

The voyage took place between November 14 and November 26, 2017 departing from Fremantle (WA) and arriving in Hobart (TAS). \nThe Kongsberg SBP120 (sub bottom profiler) was used to acquire data containing the specular reflections at different sediment interfaces below the seafloor. The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP120 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\nData are stored in .raw (139 files 12.2 GB) raw and .seg (139 files 12.2 GB) segy formats at CSIRO. Dedicated shelf transects were run from 15/11/2018 until 20/11/2018.\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request",

    "description": "Ramularia Leaf Spot (RLS) disease is a significant threat to Australian barley production caused by the fungal pathogen Ramularia collo-cygni. These data resources include information on epidemiology and distribution of the pathogen as well as yield and grain quality loss caused by RLS.\nAccurate identification of RLS is indispensable for effective crop management. These data resources include information for RLS identification in Australian barley crops. This knowledge facilitates timely intervention for disease control, minimizes crop mismanagement, and mitigates losses in yield and grain quality due to RLS disease.\nThe datasets on this page include information on genetic and population diversity of Ramularia collo-cygni in Australia, disease incidence, triggers, potential regional relationships, and the quantification of economic losses stemming from this pathogen. Additionally, these resources include insights into the contributions of seeds, stubble, and alternate hosts in pathogen dissemination and disease development, as well as best practices for disease management and fungicide resistance.\nThese data resources result from collaborative research co-funded by the NSW Department of Primary Industries and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. These data resources include datasets which are available to download as well as metadata for resources which have restricted access and will be made available only on request.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of small for gestational age births, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nBabies are defined as small for gestational age if their birthweight is below the 10th percentile for their gestational age and sex, according to national birthweight percentiles. Includes singleton liveborn babies with known birthweight, gestational age and sex.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

    "title": "The ecology and impacts of the introduced basket clam, Corbula gibba in Port Phillip Bay, Australia",
    "description": "This thesis describes the ecology and impact of the introduced European basket clam, Corbula gibba (Olivi, 1792), in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. A bay-wide survey conducted in 1998 found C. gibba throughout the bay but it was significantly more abundant in deeper, muddier sites. Life history studies carried out at three sites found that two sites were dominated by a single cohort of large adults while the third site had one cohort of adults and one of juveniles.  This juvenile cohort grew at a rate of about 4 mm2 per month but experienced high mortality, with only 0.5% surviving a six month period. Longer term abundance patterns available at St. Leonards, and supplemented by this study, found that, between 1969 and 1999, adult density varied between 0 and 106 individuals per m2 while juveniles were found in varying densities in 5 of 6 years sampled. The effect of anthropogenic disturbance on resident populations and subsequent invasion by C. gibba into disturbed sites was assessed experimentally using scallop dredging. Scallop dredging did not affect resident populations but the impact on subsequent invasion by C. gibba could not be determined as recruitment failed to occur over the study period and adult migration was not observed. The effect of ambient densities of C. gibba on endemic species such as the commercial scallop, Pecten fumatus, was investigated experimentally in the field.  These experiments found that C. gibba significantly reduced the size and growth of juvenile P. fumatus to a greater extent than an equivalent number of conspecific scallops. Competition for shared food resources did not appear to be the mechanism underlying this impact, however, as dietary studies found that C. gibba was not a superior competitor. Additional studies found that C. gibba did not affect the recruitment of the native bivalves, Mytilus edulis and Electroma Georgiana, but significantly reduced conspecific recruitment. This effect is likely to have implications for the structure of C.gibba populations in the bay.",

    "description": "<b>Version Oct 2021</b>\nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Caboolture West Local Plan and  North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nFor more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/subsite.aspx?id=139941\">helpful information sheets</a> or contact Council. \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of emergency department presentations in public hospitals by patient location. Mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations are defined as presentations to public hospital EDs that have a principal diagnosis of mental and behavioural disorders. However, the definition does not fully capture all potential mental health-related presentations to EDs such as intentional self-harm, as intent can be difficult to identify in an ED environment and can also be difficult to code. The data spans the financial years of 2014-2018 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nState and territory health authorities collect a core set of nationally comparable information on most public hospital ED presentations in their jurisdiction, which is compiled annually into the National Non-Admitted Patient Emergency Department Care Database (NNAPEDCD). The data reported for 2014–15 to 2017–18 is sourced from the NNAPEDCD. Information about mental health-related services provided in EDs prior to 2014–15 was supplied directly to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) by states and territories.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCaution is required when conducting time-series analyses. The data source changed in 2014–15 from data provided by state and territory health authorities (2004–05 to 2013–14) to the NNAPEDCD. Additionally, due to the methodology applied for mapping the data over time, years prior to 2017–18 may be an undercount or data may not be displayed where SA3s have changed over time.\n\n\nMental health-related emergency department presentations included in this report are those that had a principal diagnosis that fell within the Mental and behavioural disorders chapter (Chapter 5) of ICD-10-AM (codes F00–F99) or the equivalent ICD-9-CM or SNOMED codes. It does not include codes for self-harm or poisoning.\n\n\nFrom 2014–15 onwards, diagnosis information was not reported using a uniform classification. The mapping of SNOMED codes (used by NSW) to ICD-10AM may lead to an under-estimation of mental health-related presentations.\n\n\nChanges in the volume of patients over time for NSW may be attributed, in part, to the increased number of hospitals included in the data for this jurisdiction.\n\n",

    "description": "Site KB is sampled monthly by the Derwent Estuary Program as part of the  Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The data is current as at 31 Dec 2021, includes quarterly snapshots beginning from Dec 2019, and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) 2016.  The geographical boundaries are sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) website.\nThe National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is an independent statutory agency. Their role is to implement the NDIS, which will support a better life for hundreds of thousands of Australians with a significant and permanent disability and their families and carers.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the NDIA.\nPlease note:\n\n\nThe State/Territory groupings are based on the participant's latest residential address.\n\n\nThe availability status of each SA3 is based on the mapping between the SA3, NDIA Service Districts and the bilateral agreements to determine phase-in date for each SA3.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised the participant data.  Participant count values of '&lt;11' have been set to null.",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "These data sets include the picoplankton component analysed by flow cytometry from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. \nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>Fusarium</strong> model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information about this hemi-pelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core and the percentage of carbonate material in each sample. XRD analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

    "title": "Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 19 August 2015.",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n The dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\nThe Clarence-Moreton Asset database V6.1 supersedes the previous version (Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 11 December 2014, minor version v20150603 GUID = 248361ac-2495-4228-a4e4-e3c6cabf7433) of the Asset database. \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v6.1  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150819.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150819_GISOnly.gdb), the Water Dependant Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150819.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.

    "description": "We propose to continue undertake a pulsar survey along the Galactic Plane using the new Methanol Multibeam receiver in order to uncover pulsars previously selected against in lower frequency surveys. The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies.",

    "description": "\n<b>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</b>\nRiver and Creek Flooding \nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\n\n\n\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside. \n\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i> Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions - with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage. \n<i>Purpose</i>: To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i> Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations. <i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i> \n<i>Flood Height:</i> Indicates the\napproximate water surface level of potential inundation during a\ncomputer-modelled flood event, expressed in meters above mean sea level. This dataset\nrepresents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of\n0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i> The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is: 1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year\n<i>Likelihood: PossibleAnnual Exceedance Probability (AEP): </i><i>1%</i>\n<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 100 Year</i>\nA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but nevertheless still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.\n<i>Version Notes 3.1.0</i> - First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE. (October 2023)\n<i>Version Resolution: 2.5m</i>\n<i>Data Reliability: A </i>\n<i>Indicates the flood data is of the highest available standard and has been prepared using the most recent flood model and input data </i>\n<i>Further Information: </i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website: <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding</a>",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "Since 1993 some students have enrolled part-time . All enrolments are reported in full-time equivalent units (FTEs) and include full-time and part-time students. \nData Notes:\n\n\nDistance Education refers to enrolments in Distance Education Centres. It is separate to home learning arrangements made necessary by extraordinary circumstances such as pandemics. \n\n\nDistance education centres (DECs) provide schooling for students who are isolated or whose special circumstances prevent them from attending a regular school. They operate either as separate schools or as units within regular primary, central and high schools. Students enrolled in DECs are counted in their corresponding years of schooling. \n\n\nIn conjunction with the NSW School of Languages (formerly Open High School), DECs also provide individual subject enrolment, widening study opportunities for secondary students. These students are enrolled and counted at their home schools.\n\n\nEnrolments (FTE) in distance education are recorded mid-year.\n\n\nAll enrolments are reported in full-time equivalent units (FTE), and include full-time and part-time students whose main school is the distance education centre.\n\n\nThe FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

    "description": "Disjunct faunal species were defined as those with populations separated by a substantial geographic distance from other populations, such that non-flying taxa are unlikely to interbreed with other populations. These species are often evidence of past distributions or biogeographic events and therefore demonstrate past processes, as required by National Estate criterion A1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate. Vagrant species were excluded from consideration. \n\nAs is the case for flora, the fact that Tasmania is an island and its extreme southerly position in Australia mean that many faunal species are necessarily at the edge of their biogeographic range in the region or have disjunct populations across Bass Strait. \n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:500 000 scale) detailing disjunct fauna populations. Disjunct fauna polygons are given a unique code, the relevant National Estate values and criteria, and cleared land status.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "title": "Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 26 February 2016",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\nAsset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 26 February 2016 (V2) supersedes the previous version of the SSB Asset database V1.1 (Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 18 December 2015, GUID: d7dd32e7-a0cc-4537-a280-c71f4be87e01). It contains the Asset database (SSB_asset_database_20160226.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (SSB_asset_database_20160226_GISOnly.gdb), the draft Water Dependent Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-SYD-SSB-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-v20160226.xlsx), a data dictionary (SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the Water Asset Information Tool (WAIT) process as outlined below. This version should be used for Materiality Test (M2) test.\n\nThe user needs to join the Table Assetlist  or Elementlist  to the spatial data.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Sydney regions are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Sydney bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \" SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate_\t              Notes\n\n1.0\t               3/08/2015\t        Initial database.\n\n1.1\t               18/12/2015\t         \"(1) Added 93 assets/9897elements from 18 datasets required by SSB asset workshop.\n\n                                                           (2) Fixed 22 AIDs in spatial data, which can not directly join  to relevant table in asset database\"\n\n2\t              26/02/2016             \"1) Updating for \n\n                                                              (a) Updated Group/SubGroup/Class of Platypus elements and assets to Ecological/ Vegetation/ Habitat (potential species distribution)\n\n                                                              (b)Turned off all economic elements/assets from GWMP (11), SW BWR area (40) and SW WAR area (40)\n\n                                                              (c)Add one point Economic assets from Water access licence 10CA117220 (WAL) \n\n                                                              (d)Turned off 382 GW point elements and reprocess GW point assets\n\n                                                              (e)Turned off five assets (AID: 63163,63162,63161,63160,63159)  from  GMA data  \n\n                                                              (f)Updated asset name and name rule for previous SCA assets by replacing \"(SCA Water Supply Dams)\" using \"(Sydney water supply dams)\" \n\n                                                              (g) Turn off all four assets of SCA water source areas(AID:  63567, 63568, 63569, 63570)\n\n                                                              (h) Turn off 12 assets of SCA dams.\n\n                                                         (2)Updated for M2 test results from SSB assessment team and create the draft Water Dependent Asset Register file \n\n                                                              (BA-SYD-SSB-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-v20160226.xlsx)\"\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 26 February 2016.

Each microclimate sensor device will have several climate sensors embedded inside. Sensor devices are typically installed on a street pole and locations are selected based on relevant project criteria.\n\nSince the beginning of the Microclimate Sensor Readings dataset in 2019, some sensor devices have been relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works or re-assignment to new climate projects. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical data.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with related dataset (linked below). Site_id refers to the location of the unique sensor device which may have changed over time. \n\nRelated datasets:\n<a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/microclimate-sensor-readings/information/\">Microclimate Sensor - Sensor Readings</a>",

    "description": "The study area of the Hawkesbury Floodplain Risk Management Study &amp; Plan comprises all\nof the Hawkesbury River and its immediate surrounds that fall within the Hawkesbury Local\nGovernment Area. It extends from Agnes Banks/Yarramundi in the south to Wisemans\nFerry in the north, representing a river distance of approximately 83 km and an area of some\n220 km2 subject to inundation in the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF). The main area of\nfocus is for the area from Agnes Banks/Yarramundi to Wilberforce, including the flood?prone\ncommunities of Richmond and Windsor (see Figure 1.2).\n\nThe Hawkesbury?Nepean catchment covers about 22,500 km2 and is one of the largest of all\ncoastal rivers in New South Wales (see Figure 1.3). It includes extensive grazing areas in\nthe south?west and large National Parks in the Blue Mountains to the north?west. Urban\ndevelopment in the catchment area includes towns such as Goulburn and Lithgow and outer\nsuburbs of western Sydney including Camden and Penrith (ERM Mitchell McCotter, 1995).\n\nMore than 40% of the total Hawkesbury?Nepean catchment  about 9,000 km2  is upstream\nof Warragamba Dam. Half of this area comes from the Wollondilly River. The Warragamba\nRiver joins the Nepean River 3.5 km below the dam. The Grose River is a major tributary\nwhich joins the Nepean at Yarramundi, after which the Nepean is known as the Hawkesbury.\nWhilst the Grose has a catchment of only 650 km2, it drains a high rainfall area and can\nhave a significant effect on flooding at Windsor. In particular, it can cause flood levels to rise\nquickly in the early part of major storms (ERM Mitchell McCotter, 1995).\n\nThe catchment area at the Windsor gauge is about 12,800 km2. South Creek joins just\ndownstream of the Windsor gauge. Whilst its catchment area of 640 km2 is virtually the\nsame as the Grose, it receives less rainfall and thus has less impact on Hawkesbury River\nflooding. At Lower Portland the Hawkesbury is joined by the Colo River, which drains an\narea of 4,640 km2 (ERM Mitchell McCotter, 1995). The Colo can influence flooding in the\nHawkesbury River depending on the movement of flood producing rainfall over the\nHawkesbury and Colo River catchments. The Colo has a shorter response time to rainfall\nand as shown in the 1978 flood, it can have a large impact on Hawkesbury River levels,\nparticularly downstream of Sackville. A study of the joint probabilities of floods originating\nfrom the Hawkesbury and the Colo has been carried out (AWACS, 1997). AWACS found\nthat the 100 year design flood levels in the Hawkesbury downstream of the Colo confluence\nwere relatively insensitive to the assumed Colo contributions. Nevertheless in some events,\nflooding in the Hawkesbury River within the lower portions of the study area can be\nsignificantly influenced by the Colo subject to the spatial and temporal distribution of the\nrainfall.\n\nWhen measured in 2000, the Hawkesbury River was subject to tidal influence up to\nYarramundi Bridge (MHL, 2005). However, the limit of tidal influence is rarely constant.\nThere are short?term cyclical changes in response to the ever?changing ocean tides, and\nchanges over long time spans according to both natural processes and artificial disturbance.\nSand extraction in the vicinity of the limit of tidal influence in the Hawkesbury River is\nreported to have caused the tidal limit to move a further 10 km upstream over the 20th\ncentury (Estuaries Branch, 2010).\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Floodplain Risk Management Plan (FRMP) showing the preferred floodplain risk\nmanagement measures for the Hawkesbury study area is presented in this chapter. The recommended measures have been selected from the range of measures discussed in\nChapter 6, after an assessment of each measures impact on flood risk, as well as\nconsideration of environmental, social, and economic factors. The recommended measures\nare presented in Table 9.1. The principal components of the Plan are presented below\naccording to priority, which is assessed on the basis of how easily (quickly) each measure\ncan be implemented and on value for money. The timing of the proposed works will depend\non Councils overall budgetary commitments, and the availability of funds from other\nsources.\n\nPRIORITISED MEASURES\n\nHigh Priority Measures\n<ul>\n<li>Item 1: Community Flood Education</li>\n<li>Item 2(a): Dual Outbound Lanes on Jim Anderson Bridge</li>\n<li>Item 2(c): Construction of Community Refuges</li>\n<li>Item 2(d): Flood Emergency Plans for Special Uses and Utilities</li>\n<li>Item 2(e): Flood Emergency Plan Templates for Caravan Parks</li>\n<li>Item 2(f): Review and Update Hawkesbury?Nepean Flood Emergency Sub Plan and\nNSW State Flood Sub Plan (Annex C)</li>\n<li>Item 2(i): Investigation of Road Duplication Options at the Eastern End of the Jim\nAnderson Bridge</li>\n<li>Item 3(a): Provision of Evacuation Risk Advice for Existing Development Proposals</li>\n<li>Item 4: A range of Town Planning Measures including revisions to the Flood Risk\nchapter of Councils DCP</li>\n</ul>\n\nMedium Priority Measures\n<ul>\n<li>Item 2(b): Enhance Emergency Management Assessment Tools</li>\n<li>Item 5: Study of Voluntary House Raising and Redevelopment Options</li>\n<li>Item 6: Assessment of a Levee and Refuge Mound for McGraths Hill</li>\n</ul>\n\nLow Priority Measures\n<ul>\n<li>Item 2(g): Provide additional crossing of South Creek</li>\n<li>Item 7: Update Flood Behaviour Data for Valley</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The Port Phillip Bay Coastal Hazard Assessment (the product) is a digital dataset consisting of multiple spatial layer outputs from modelled erosion, inundation and groundwater hazard scenarios.\n\nThe product is recommended for use at the regional scale around Port Phillip Bay. Application of the data should be guided by the accompanying Port Phillip Bay hazard assessment technical reports (CSIRO 2022, Water Technology 2023, Kennedy 2022) and expert advice. The product is not suitable for individual property scale assessments.\n\nThe datasets available are as follows. Further detail on technical assumptions for these scenarios are provided in the accompanying technical reports. Additional data sets referenced in the reports are also available on request.\n\nStorm tide inundation\n\nStorm tide inundation extents for the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) for a range of Sea Level Rise (SLR) scenarios (0m, 0.5m, 0.8m, 1.1m):\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_00SLR\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_05SLR\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_08SLR\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_11SLR\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_14SLR\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_00SLR_WITHRAINFALL\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_05SLR_WITHRAINFALL\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_08SLR_WITHRAINFALL\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_11SLR_WITHRAINFALL\n- PPBCHA_INUNDATION_EXTENT_1AEP_14SLR_WITHRAINFALL\n\nStorm tide inundation extents for each SLR scenario are presented as a combined vector layer that incorporates the modelled 95th, 50th, and 5th percentiles.\n\nErosion\n\nErosion extents for the 1%AEP for a range of Sea Level Rise (SLR) scenarios (0m, 0.2m, 0.5m, 0.8m, 1.1m).\n- PPBCHA_EROSION_EXTENT_1AEP_2010_00SLR\n- PPBCHA_EROSION_EXTENT_1AEP_2040_02SLR\n- PPBCHA_EROSION_EXTENT_1AEP_2070_05SLR\n- PPBCHA_EROSION_EXTENT_1AEP_2100_08SLR\n- PPBCHA_EROSION_EXTENT_1AEP_2100_11SLR\n- PPBCHA_EROSION_EXTENT_1AEP_2100_14SLR\n\nErosion hazard extents are the modelled 95th percentile. Sea level of 0m as of 2010.\n\nGroundwater\n\nGroundwater extents indicating where the hazard is shallow (within 0 to 2m below land surface) for a range of Sea Level Rise (SLR) scenarios (0m, 0.2m, 0.5m, 0.8m):\n- PPBCHA_GROUNDWATER_EXTENT_SHALLOW_00SLR\n- PPBCHA_GROUNDWATER_EXTENT_SHALLOW_02SLR\n- PPBCHA_GROUNDWATER_EXTENT_SHALLOW_05SLR\n- PPBCHA_GROUNDWATER_EXTENT_SHALLOW_08SLR\n- PPBCHA_GROUNDWATER_EXTENT_SHALLOW_11SLR\n- PPBCHA_GROUNDWATER_EXTENT_SHALLOW_14SLR\n\nShallow groundwater extent layer is derived from the groundwater depth raster.\n\nReport Citations:\n\nCSIRO - McInnes, K.L., O’Grady, J.O., Prakash, M., Dahlhaus, P., Rosengren, N.J., Hoeke, R.K., Lauchlan Arrowsmith, C., Hernaman, V., Cohen, R., Seers, B., Chen, Y., Walters, D., Couto, P., Trenham, C., Forbes-Smith, N.

The location of recaptures was documented for 916 tagged prawns in 1997 and 512 tagged prawns in 1998. Tag recapture information and commercial fishery logbook information was used to test whether red-legged banana prawns moved continuously to deeper waters or whether they moved first to deep water but then returned to shallower waters. The analysis is based on compartment models of recaptures per unit of fishing effort.",

The data shows business establishments with their trading name, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, location and CLUE block and small area allocation. The data covers the year period of 2007.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has acquired the data through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Hilltops Council (Council) commissioned the Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan for the township of Boorowa. The overall objectives of the Floodplain Risk Management Study (FRMS) were to assess the impacts of flooding, review existing Council policies as they relate to development of land in flood liable areas, consider options for the management of flood affected land and to develop a Floodplain Risk Management Plan (FRMP) which:\ni) Proposes modifications to existing Council policies to ensure that the development of flood affected land is undertaken so as to be compatible with the flood hazard and risk.\nii) Proposes Flood Planning Levels for the various land uses in the floodplain.\niii) Sets out the recommended program of works and measures aimed at reducing over time, the social, environmental and economic impacts of flooding.\niv) Provides a program for implementation of the proposed works and measures.\nThe FRMS focuses on Main Stream Flooding from the Boorowa River, Ryans Creek and Ryans Tributary, as well as two major un-named tributaries, Minor Tributary Flooding caused by high flows in the minor un-named tributaries which drain to the aforementioned watercourses, and Major Overland Flow areas which occur in the urbanised parts of Boorowa and its immediate surrounds.",

    "title": "Victoria - National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Map (PLUS)",
    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "We propose to monitor the bursts from the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst FRB 20240619D over six months using the Murriyang UWL receiver. The primary aim is to study the evolution of burst activity and polarization properties with frequency and time, and to discover any potential periodicity in the burst activity. These insights will enhance our understanding of the progenitor, emission physics, and the immediate magneto-ionic environment of FRB 20240619D, thereby informing the general FRB population. A total of 15 hours of observing between August and November 2024 resulted in over 1300 bursts detected using the UWL receiver. Some bursts exhibit complex spectro-temporal emission patterns. The burst rate, based on Murriyang and MeerKAT observations, indicates that the source was active until September 2nd, after which it became inactive. Given that two other repeating FRBs have exhibited periodic activity cycles, it is reasonable to expect that FRB 20240619D could become active again, making continued monitoring crucial. The UWL receiver's broad frequency coverage and sensitivity are essential for detecting many bursts and enabling simultaneous observations at different frequencies. This is important for understanding the burst activity evolution with time and frequency, spectral properties, and underlying emission mechanisms. The combination of sensitivity and wide bandwidth makes Murriyang the ideal telescope for monitoring this FRB. Results from these observations will be pivotal in understanding FRB 20240619D's place within the broader repeater population and its potential connection to broader FRB progenitor models.",

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. \n\nThe most obvious change in relative abundance in core BAR9403 (off the coast of Sumatra) is shown by sub-polar to transitional 'upwelling' species Ga. bulloides with abundances of 26% at approximately 14,000yrs BP and 22.7% during the Holocene. This is compared to the periods from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) where the relative abundance of Ga. bulloides is generally <10%. Gr. menardii, a tropical 'upwelling' species, also increases its relative abundance during MIS 2 from <8% during MIS 3 to a peak abundance of 16% at ~17,000yrs BP.",

    "description": "The Australian Priority Investment Approach to Welfare (PIA) policy initiative was established as part of the 2015-16 Budget, following a comprehensive review of Australia’s welfare system. The initiative uses data analysis to identify groups at risk of long-term welfare dependence. As part of the PIA, in September 2016, the Minister for Social Services announced a plan to allow limited public access to PIA data. \r\n\r\nA synthetic version of the PIA data has been created to provide access to administrative data for general users while maintaining the privacy of individuals. The synthetic PIA data relates to individuals who have made a claim for, are receiving or have received payments or services administered under social security law. This includes benefit types such as Aged Pension, Youth Allowance, Newstart and Disability Support Pension. The synthetic data contains a limited number of variables suitable for research, while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of individuals. The synthetic dataset has been created by applying a privacy-preserving algorithm on the original PIA data. This process results in each person’s true data being modified such that the overall group data very closely represents that of the original dataset, yet no one individual’s data remains in the synthetic dataset. That is, the dataset is a combination of synthetic records that, when combined, reflect the shape of the original dataset. \r\n\r\nThe synthetic PIA data contains a series of point-in-time quarterly snapshots dated from July 2001 to June 2015. This results in 56 separate quarters of administrative data. Each quarter includes 31 variables (listed below) that are consistent across all quarters. There are approximately 5 million individual records represented in each quarter. \r\n\r\nThe synthetic PIA data is available via free registration at Dataverse: https://dataverse.ada.edu.au/dataverse/pia_synthetic. \r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Peth (West) - Northbridge in WA with SA2 code 503021297, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This dataset contains hourly pedestrian counts since 2009 from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated on a monthly basis and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with the Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations dataset which details the location, status and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting pedestrian counts over time.Importants notes about this dataset:• Where no pedestrians have passed underneath a sensor during an hour, a count of zero will be shown for the sensor for that hour.• Directional readings are not included, though we hope to make this available later in the year. Directional readings are provided in the Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute) dataset.The Pedestrian Counting System helps to understand how people use different city locations at different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future. A representation of pedestrian volume which compares each location on any given day and time can be found in our Online Visualisation.Related datasets:Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations",

    "description": "The Drainage Point Feature Class sits within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Assets Geodatabase.  The Drainage Point layer includes Stormwater Outlets, Stormwater Drain Pits, Retention Basins, Rubbish Traps, Grease Traps, Head Walls, and Oil Separators.   \n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially.   The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes.  The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS.  The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field.  AMS is also set up to be used by other Department Planning, Industry &amp; Environment groups eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\n\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hazards, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point.\nDetailed documentation is available including:\n-  Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets)\n-  Data Model\n-  Business Rules\n-  Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed.  Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

    "description": "###_NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a register (known as the Charity Register), which contains information about charities. This dataset is a subset of the information available on the Charity Register.\r\n\r\nAdditional information for each charity (including governing documents and names of any Responsible Persons) can be found by searching the Charity Register at [acnc.gov.au/charity](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nIn some situations, charities can apply to have some or all of their information withheld from the Charity Register.  If the ACNC has approved for the information to be withheld, it won’t appear on the Charity Register, or in this dataset. \r\n\r\nEach year, charities also lodge Annual Information Statements with the ACNC. These record further information about charities’ purposes, activities and operations for the year - the ACNC publishes datasets for each Annual Information Statement. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",
