    "title": "AGSO Cruise Report: Cruise 210 : The \"Sojourn 7\" Swath-mapping Cruise of R.V. Melville off Eastern Tasmania and in the Gippsland Basin",
    "description": "From 10 to 17 April 1997, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) chartered the 85 m Research Vessel Melville from Scripps Institution of Oceanography on a cooperative scientific basis, to map the sea bed east and northeast of Tasmania including the deep water part of the Gippsland Basin. The vessel was equipped with the SeaBeam 2000 multibeam sonar system, capable of swath-mapping the morphology and roughness of the sea bed in a swath 3.5 times as wide as the water depth. The central beam gave a 12 kHz bathymetric profile. Other equipment employed included a magnetometer and gravity meter. Navigation, by military standard GPS using the P code, had an accuracy of about 5 m. Detailed ship's tracks for the survey, from south to north, are shown in Figures 2-5.\n\nThe aims of the cruise were to determine the morphology and sea bed character of selected areas, to aid in tectonic, basin and sedimentological studies, to aid the fishing industry, and to provide critical information for future seismic profiling and geological sampling. Satellite gravity images, and sparse bathymetric and seismic profiles, were used to plan the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU beef industry, world biofuel policies and the South American wine industry. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 6.1 per cent to around $60.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 4.2 per cent increase to $56.7 billion in 2015-16. At this forecast level the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 16 per cent higher than the average of $52 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to decrease by 2.2 per cent to $28.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 14.7 per cent to $31.7 billion in 2016-17. This reflects forecast increases in the gross value of horticulture and cotton production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to increase by 6.7 per cent to $47.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.4 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.6 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2016-17 are wheat (up 25 per cent), wool (3 per cent), sugar (23 per cent), wine (3 per cent), barley (15 per cent), cotton (56 per cent), chickpeas (74 per cent), lamb (4 per cent), canola (33 per cent) and rock lobster (6 per cent). \r\n• The forecast increases in export earnings are expected to be partly offset by forecast falls in beef and veal (down 17 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (17 per cent) and mutton (12 per cent). Export earnings for dairy products are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 3.4 per cent to $1.6 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7.1 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US75 cents in 2016-17, slightly higher than the average of US73 cents in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU beef industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers and importers of beef. Access to the EU market is controlled by strict animal health requirements and various quotas, which limit the amount of beef that can be imported. \r\n• As the European Union is a high value market for beef, improved access for Australia from a free trade agreement would likely lead to increased exports to this market. \r\n\r\n Oils ain't oils  \r\n• Biofuel policies in some of the world's largest biofuel producing economies have the potential to affect returns to Australian agricultural exports such as canola, sugar and coarse grains. \r\n• This article looks at recent developments in the world's leading biofuel producers and consumers (the United States, European Union and Brazil) and discusses the expected impact on world commodity prices in 2016-17 and the high-level implications for agricultural commodities in the medium term. \r\n South American wine industry  \r\n• South America is a major world producer and exporter of wine, accounting for almost 14 per cent of world production. Wine exports from South America have increased markedly in the past 15 years and its wine increasingly competes in Australia's major and emerging export markets. \r\n• This article focuses on the development of the Argentine and Chilean wine industries, with a focus on their competitiveness with Australian wine exports. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2014 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia conducted a marine seismic survey (GA-0352) over poorly defined areas of the Gippsland Basin between 5th of April to the 24th of April 2015. The aim was to acquire industry-standard precompetitive 2D seismic data, Multi-beam echo-sounder (MBES) and sub-bottom profiling (SBP) data to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the basin. The survey, undertaken as part of the Department of Industry and Science's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP), aimed to identify and characterise indicators of natural hydrocarbon or fluid seepage that may indicate compromised seal integrity in the region. The data collected during this survey will enhance sequence stratigraphic studies in the Gippsland Basin that provide constraints on the most suitable areas for storage of CO2 and help to identify potential CO2 storage reservoirs. The survey was conducted by Gardline CGG vessel MV Duke \nThe data collected during the survey are available for free download from the Geoscience Australia website.\nThis dataset include all the bathymetry data collected during the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Summary: \nA comprehensive NSW Land Tenure layer has been developed, integrating the latest and most reliable datasets sourced from various governmental authorities and departments. To the best of our knowledge, this layer offers detailed mapping of recent updates and changes in land tenure across the state. It includes information on land allocations, ownership transformations, and management updates, providing an up-to-date and accurate representation of land tenure in New South Wales.\nDescription: \nThe statewide Land Tenure layer is a comprehensive dataset created by incorporating spatial and aspatial data from various state and commonwealth government departments, organisations and authorities, including the Forestry Corporation of NSW; NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development; NSW Spatial Services; Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (Environment and Heritage); The Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (ABARES: SOFR23 &amp; SOFR18); the NSW SEED data portal; and National Park. \nThe wall-to-wall spatial feature class demonstrates how land in NSW is being managed or owned. It can also be employed to monitor changes in land management or ownership transfer over time.\nThe process of acquiring datasets for updating the tenure layer and creating the statewide layer began in January 2024 and continued until August 2024. The collected datasets were amalgamated, and gaps were filled. This combined layer has then been manually assessed and visually compared against various datasets to ensure its completeness and accuracy. Esri basemaps such as Imagery, Imagery Hybrid, OpenStreetMap, and Google Earth maps were also used for visual assessment. Furtheremore, expert knowledge from government professionals, and land history web search were considered to address potential inaccuracies and unreliability in datasets from various sources.\nThe land tenure data consists of seven Tenure classes each class covering various tenure types as below: \n    - Tenure Class: presents tenure classification of the dataset as Crownland-Leasehold; Crownland-Other; Indigenous Owned; National Park; Private; State Forest; Unresolved Tenure.\nTenure Type of each tenure class are as follow:    Crownland-Leasehold: Crown Timberland Lease; LEASE (SOFR2023); Leasehold Crown Land; Western Lands Lease;      Crownland-Other: Crown Road; Crown Waterway; Either Crown Waterway, Road or other; OCL (SOFR2023); Other crownland; Public Road; Reserved Crown Timber Land; Timber Reserve; Vacant And Reserved Crown Land; Vacant Crown Land; Reserve for Public Buildings (Forestry);      Indigenous Owned: Aboriginal Area;     National Park: Conservation Reserve; Fire trail within national parks; Historic Sites; National Park; Nature Reserve; NCR (SOFR2023); Regional Park; State Conservation Area;     Private: Hardwood Joint Venture; PRIV (SOFR2023); Private; Hardwood Plantations; Private Property; Private Softwood Plantation; Profit á Prendre; Softwood Joint Venture;     State Forest: FCNSW Ownership; MUF (SOFR2023); State Forest: State Forest OEH Managed Flora Reserve;     Unresolved Tenure: null (-2); ND (SOFR2023).\n    - Shape_Area: Area of each Tenure class in  square meter.\n    Caveats: \n    - In general, data from diverse sources retains different levels of accuracy, reliability and coverage, therefore, a thorough visual assessment has been carried out to overcome the issue. Having said that, there still could be potential minor errors which could have been missed due to the large extent of the dataset. \n    - Note that Roads, Waterways and general public areas across the Greater Sydney and Wollongong have not been properly mapped in this version. This will be updated in the next update.",

    "description": "ESRI grids showing silicate, linearly interpolated from CARS2000 mean and seasonal fields to 0.1 degree spaced grid, at depths of 0, 150, 500, 1000 and 2000 metres. The loess filter used to create CARS2000 resolves at each point a mean value and a sinusoid with 1 year period (and in some cases a 6 month period sinusoid - the \"semi-annual cycle\".) The provided \"annual amplitude\" is simply the magnitude of that annual sinusoid. CARS is a set of seasonal maps of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, generated using Loess mapping from all available oceanographic data in the region. It covers the region 100-200E, 50-0S, on a 0.5 degree grid, and on 56 standard depth levels. Higher resolution versions are also available for the Australian continental shelf. The data was obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 98 and CSIRO Marine and NIWA archives. It was designed to improve on the Levitus WOA98 Atlas, in the Australian region. CARS2000 is derived from ocean cast data, which is always measured above the sea floor. However, for properties which do not change rapidly near the sea floor, this would not lead to a significant error. All the limitations of CARS2000 also apply here.",

It is important to note that the plan must be sealed. On top of this the parcel must have been transferred to council, which you can tell from the folio text. That's why these fields have been included: Sealed Plan, Plan Notation and Transfer Date. If all three fields are populated the land parcel does not need a council decision. Note: \"for drainage purposes\" does not suffice.\r\n\r\nIn situations where there is no sealed plan or the sealed plan doesn't contain wording as described, there must be a council decision for it to become part of the public land list. For this the fields: council decision date and agenda item are provided. There are two fields for agenda item as some area were part approved in one item with the rest in another.\r\n\r\nDirection was given by the Property Coordinator in the creation of this layer.\r\n\r\nThis layer follows cadastral boundaries where they are accurate. Where they are not, it follows the area boundary. We have excluded roads from the layer. Some areas are not whole of title. Proposed public lend is included.

    "description": "We propose to monitor the bursts from the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst FRB 20240619D over six months using the Murriyang UWL receiver. The primary aim is to study the evolution of burst activity and polarization properties with frequency and time, and to discover any potential periodicity in the burst activity. These insights will enhance our understanding of the progenitor, emission physics, and the immediate magneto-ionic environment of FRB 20240619D, thereby informing the general FRB population. A total of 15 hours of observing between August and November 2024 resulted in over 1300 bursts detected using the UWL receiver. Some bursts exhibit complex spectro-temporal emission patterns. The burst rate, based on Murriyang and MeerKAT observations, indicates that the source was active until September 2nd, after which it became inactive. Given that two other repeating FRBs have exhibited periodic activity cycles, it is reasonable to expect that FRB 20240619D could become active again, making continued monitoring crucial. The UWL receiver's broad frequency coverage and sensitivity are essential for detecting many bursts and enabling simultaneous observations at different frequencies. This is important for understanding the burst activity evolution with time and frequency, spectral properties, and underlying emission mechanisms. The combination of sensitivity and wide bandwidth makes Murriyang the ideal telescope for monitoring this FRB. Results from these observations will be pivotal in understanding FRB 20240619D's place within the broader repeater population and its potential connection to broader FRB progenitor models.",

The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2013.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Sydney Metropolitan catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who reported they were covered by private health insurance in the preceding 12 months, by Primary Health Network (PHN) area. The data spans the years of 2015-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "title": "State Planning Policy 2.4: Significant Geological Supplies (DMIRS-074)",
    "description": "This dataset comprises mapping associated with the State Planning Policy 2.4 Basic Raw Materials (BRM). Significant Geological Supplies (SGS) are those BRM areas identified by the DMIRS as having State significance due to the size of the resource, relative scarcity, demand and/or location near growth areas and transport routes. Most SGS areas are derived from, and therefore are a subset of, DMIRS published Regionally Significant Basic Raw Material mapping. Where this is not the case, they are derived using the same rule set as for the Regionally Significant Basic Raw Material mapping. Within the Perth and Peel Region, the SGS areas were further refined by an extensive interagency BRM planning process, which included public consultation in 2015. In the Perth and Peel Region, the SGS areas took into account environmental values, current and future land uses, including sequential land use opportunities, current and future infrastructure and BRM supply and demand considerations. BRM types shown are the dominant surface materials, but the application of the policy is not restricted to those materials. For example, a SGS area designated as ‘Sand’ may include limestone and gravel and the policy applies to all BRM derived from within those areas. The designation of an SGS area does not obligate a private landowner or State agency to extract these resources, nor does it presume that extraction would be environmentally acceptable or that subsequent approvals for extraction or environmental approvals are guaranteed. Planning policy associated with this mapping is documented in the State Planning Policy 2.4.",

    "title": "Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan Report Cessnock City (Black Creek) - Report",
    "description": "Cessnock City Council has engaged Cardno (NSW/ACT) Pty Ltd to prepare the Black Creek Floodplain Risk Management Study and the Black Creek Floodplain Risk Management Plan in accordance with the NSW Government Floodplain Development Manual (NSW Government, 2005). Flooding in the catchment can pose a hazard to residents and businesses near the creeks, channels and overland flow paths.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify and examine options for the management of flooding within the Black Creek catchment.\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to document a strategy of suitable actions for implementation. The Black Creek catchment is located within the Cessnock Local Government Area (LGA) and comprises all urban areas including the Cessnock Central Business District (CBD) and surrounding suburbs. Black Creek has several tributaries, including Bellbird Creek, Lavender Creek, Limestone Creek, Kearsley Creek and Aberdare Creek. Other tributaries include the Oliver Street channel in South Cessnock and the East Cessnock Drain. These tributaries flow through rural areas towards Cessnock and generally comprise concrete lined trapezoidal channels in the urban areas. Given the numerous creeks converging in Cessnock, flooding has occurred regularly including in 1949, 1977, 1990, 1992 and 2007.\n\nAs part of this study, the existing hydrological and hydraulic models developed as part of the Black Creek Flood Study (DHI, 2010) were extended to include areas outside of the Cessnock CBD where limited information on flooding behaviour existed including Bellbird, Mount View detention basin and surrounds and northeast of the CBD. Up-to-date ground survey information was collected in 2011 and was used to represent the terrain in the hydraulic model. Flood modelling was undertaken for seven design storm events ranging from the 20% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) event up to the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event in order to assess flood behaviour in the extended hydraulic model.\n\nA number of key differences from the DHI (2010) study resulted from the extension of the hydraulic model and incorporation of up-to-date survey information including a reduction in 1% AEP flood levels ranging from 0.2m to 0.5m along Bellbird Creek and a reduction in flood levels of 0.2m along East Cessnock Drain. The updated hydraulic model provides detailed information on flood behaviour and overland flow paths in the vicinity of Mount View detention basin and through the urban areas of Cessnock. The revised flood extents were adopted by Council in March 2014.\n\nAn assessment was undertaken on the number of properties that would be subject to overground and overfloor flooding within the floodplain under various design storm events ranging from the 20% AEP event up to the PMF.  \n\nOptions to reduce or manage the effects of flooding in the catchment were investigated to manage the risks of flooding. Under the merits-based approach outlined in the NSW State Government’s Floodplain Development Manual (NSW Government, 2005) a number of potential options for the management of flooding were identified, namely:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFlood modification measures (FM Options);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nProperty modification measures (P Options); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nEmergency response modification measures (EM Options).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nAn extensive list of options was assessed against a range of criteria (technical, economic, environmental and social) and hydraulic modelling of some of the flood mitigation options was undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of those options that would involve significant capital expenditure.\n\nThe highest ranking options identified by the multi criteria analysis include:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFM5, proposed bund/flood wall east of Sixth Street properties and railway line in South Cessnock;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nEM4, Public awareness and education;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nEM5, Flood warning signs at critical locations;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nP6, Land Swap;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nP3, House Raising; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nP4, House Rebuilding;\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nA number of structural options assessed were not considered viable either due to:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nadverse impacts on flood levels such as Option FM2 (A combination of a detention basin, a bund and channel reshaping along Bellbird Creek); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nwhere the cost benefit ratio indicated the cost of implementing the option were much higher than the resultant reduction in flood damages, including:\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM1 (Combination of detention basins along Black Creek);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM3 (A combination of channel widening, channel reshaping and culvert upgrades on Black Creek);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM4 (Channel widening of the existing Oliver Street channel at South Cessnock); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM6 (Detention Basin at Austar Coal Mine Site on Bellbird Creek upstream).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe ranking is used as the basis for prioritising the components of the Floodplain Risk Management Plan  It is noted that scoring adopted is not absolute and the proposed scoring and weightings used should be reviewed in future.\n\nThe Floodplain Risk Management Plan (Chapter 15) represents the proposed implementation plan of actions for the management of flood risks in the Black Creek Floodplain. The action list contains a mix of approaches to managing flood risks with a priority system of high, medium and low for implementation of the actions.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Primary schools in Victoria for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2005.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS062008.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, New South Wales, April 16, 2008\nArrived:  \tNoumea, New Caledonia, April 29, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2016 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia has been updating its collection of navigation for marine seismic surveys in Australia. These include original navigation files, the 2003 SNIP navigation files and digitised survey track maps. The result will be an updated cleansed navigation collection.\n\nThe collection is based on the SNIP format P190 navigation file which follows the UKOOA standard. Industry standard metadata associated with a seismic survey is preserved.\n\nTo assist industry, Geoscience Australia is making available its updated version of cleansed navigation. Although the process of updating the navigation data is ongoing and there is still legacy data to check, the navigation data is at a point where a significant improvement has been achieved and it is now usable. Users should be aware that this navigation is not final and there may be errors. Geoscience Australia (email - AusGeodata@ga.gov.au) appreciates being notified of any errors found.\n\n The data is available in both KML and Shape file formats.\n\nThe KML file can be viewed using a range of applications including Google Earth, NASA WorldWind, ESRI ArcGIS Explorer, Adobe PhotoShop, AutoCAD3D or any other earth browser (geobrowser) that accepts KML formatted data.\n\nAlternatively the Shape files can be downloaded and viewed using any application that supports shape files.\n\nDisclaimer: Geoscience Australia gives no warranty regarding the data downloads provided herein nor the data's accuracy, completeness, currency or suitability for any particular purpose. Geoscience Australia disclaims all other liability for all loss, damages, expense and costs incurred by any person as a result of relying on the information in the data downloads.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information about this hemi-pelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile, the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core and the percentage of carbonate material in each sample. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

    "description": "Fiddler crabs are often spectacularly coloured and capable of dramatic colour changes. While the adaptive significance of variation resulting from short- or long-term colour changes is generally well known, the phenotypic diversity in colour pattern between individuals is often neglected. To fully understand the development and function of colour pattern variation, it is necessary to first describe its morphological basis and the naturally occurring diversity. - NB Colour pattern refers to the configuration of any coloured areas on the black carapace, regardless of their spectral composition. \n\nDuring this experiment 276 fiddler crabs of the species Uca capricornis were photographed - 117 females and 159 males. Using these pictures and a host of software programs, images were constructed that illustrate the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs, including males and females in general, and males and females with various size classes; <8mm, 8-9.9mm, 10-11.9mm, 12-13.9mm, 14-15.9mm, 16-17.9mm, and males >18mm (no photographed females were >18mm).   These images are the equivalent of an average crab's colour pattern. \n\nTo more clearly illustrate the variation in colour pattern between the groups, similar images were constructed using the standard deviation of crabs coloured at each coordinate (1mm x 1mm square).",

Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans.

The team will focus on the conditions under which these arrangements lead to effective joint management.\n\nThe overall goal of the project is to identify the means for effective engagement of Indigenous knowledge and co-management for biodiversity and cultural protection in the region; and for joint management of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area between governments and Rainforest Aboriginal peoples, in partnership with communities.\n\nThe project will deliver tested mechanisms for co-governance and collaboration between Traditional Owners, government managers, and other key partners, for biodiversity and Indigenous cultural conservation in the Wet Tropics region.\n\nThis project is now complete.",

    "title": "ACNC 2015 Annual Information Statement Data",
    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2015 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for a charity’s 2015 reporting year. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2014 – 30 June 2015, for others it will be the 2015 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2015 reporting period. \r\n\r\nSome charities report to the ACNC as part of a reporting group. The 2015 AIS information for these charities is attached as a separate dataset on this page. Any analysis of AIS data should include those charities as well.  \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS collects information about charity finances. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a network of researchers who are interested in the sector, and hold regular teleconferences. If you are interested in becoming involved in the Research network, please [email us](research@acnc.gov.au). The ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "The 2020-21 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2020-21 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n*\tPBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n*\tSelected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2020-21 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n*\tTable 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n*\tTable 1.2: Entity 2020-21 Budget Measures;\r\n*\tTable 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n*\tTable 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n*\tTable 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n*\tTables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2020-21 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n*\tPortfolio\r\n*\tDepartment/Entity\r\n*\tOutcome\r\n*\tProgram\r\n*\tExpense type\r\n*\tAppropriation type\r\n*\tDescription\r\n*\t2019-20\r\n*\t2020-21\r\n*\t2021-22\r\n*\t2022-23\r\n*\t2023-24\r\n*\tSource document\r\n*\tSource table\r\n*\tURL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n*\tAgriculture, Water and the Environment\r\n*\tAttorney-General's\r\n*\tDefence\r\n*\tEducation, Skills and Employment\r\n*\tFinance\r\n*\tForeign Affairs and Trade\r\n*\tHealth\r\n*\tHome Affairs\r\n*\tIndustry, Science, Energy and Resources\r\n*\tInfrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications\r\n*\tPrime Minister and Cabinet\r\n*\tSocial Services\r\n*\tTreasury\r\n*\tVeterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n*\tDepartment of the House of Representatives\r\n*\tDepartment of the Senate\r\n*\tDepartment of Parliamentary Services\r\n*\tParliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both _Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook_ and _Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing_ are included for reference as well.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of employed optometrists and full-time equivalent (FTE) per 100,000 population. The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWD). The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), in conjunction with the national health professional registration boards, is responsible for the national registration process for 14 health professions. The data from the annual registration process, together with data from a workforce survey that is voluntarily completed at the time of registration, form the Department of Health’s National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWDS). Data in the NHWDS includes demographic and employment information (for example, labour force status, location of main job, area of practice, work setting) for registered health professionals. In this report, the data on optometrists and ophthalmologists comes from the NHWDS as reported by AIHW.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nFTE is a measure calculated by dividing an estimate of the total hours worked by employees in an occupation in a week by an estimate of the standard hours worked for optometrists (38 hours per week). The number of FTE is then compared with the size of relevant population to get the FTE 100,000 population.\n\n",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘h_vulnerability.shp’ contains polygon data indicating the approximate boundary of the basal aquifer that is at high risk from water contamination and over extraction.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behaviour on the island.  The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the high vulnerability boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "\n\n\n<strong>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</strong>\nRiver and Creek Flooding\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside.&nbsp;\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i>&nbsp;Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions&nbsp;- with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage.&nbsp;\n<i>Purpose</i>:&nbsp;To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure&nbsp;with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach&nbsp;based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations.&nbsp;<i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i>&nbsp;\n<i>Flood Height:&nbsp;</i>Indicates the approximate water surface level of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event, expressed in metres above mean sea level. This dataset represents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of 0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i>&nbsp;The dataset includes three possible flood events of different probability.\n<i>Likelihood: Likely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood:&nbsp;Possible</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):&nbsp;1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):&nbsp;100 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood: Unlikely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year</i>\n<i>Version Notes&nbsp;3.1.0</i>&nbsp;- First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE.

Model does not include underground structures however rainfall was scaled down to account for the possibility of some run-off being contained within the underground system. A post-process was applied to eliminate areas of shallow depth, low velocity and low velocity depth product. Additional removal of model errors and small property intersects using spatial analysis and manual techniques.<i>Existing Conditions Scenario:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Modelled estimate of the extent of overland flow paths following a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability storm outside the river and creek flood extent and with some model errors and small property intersects removed.<i>Purpose:</i>&nbsp;To determine flood extent along overland flowpaths in areas outside the extent of the river and creek flood modelling. Suitable for public dissemination.<i>Flood Extent:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indicates the approximate extent of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event (not actual recorded levels). The inundation area may be less accurate where the property is flat near the outer limit of inundation, or where the ground surface has been modified since being surveyed.This dataset represents the flood extent as vector polygons without attribution.<i>Modelled Probability:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is:&nbsp;1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year<i>Likelihood:</i>&nbsp;Possible<i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):</i>&nbsp;1%<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):</i>&nbsp;100 YearA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but neverthess still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.<i>Version Notes&nbsp;1.25.0 - Sub set of F01 Version 1.24 with areas removed where field Public = N in F00N Version 1.18.8 (April 2025)</i><i>Version Resolution: 1.0m</i><i>Data Reliability: D</i><i>Indicates that Council can only provide an extent but not levels as the flood data is of limited reliability</i>\n<i><strong>Further Information</strong></i><i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website </i><a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">Flood information for residents of Moreton Bay - City of Moreton Bay</a>",

    "description": "Land capability for perennial horticulture in the south west of Western Australia based on analysis and interpretation of the best available soil-landscape mapping dataset (DPIRD-027).\n\nThe assessment for perennial horticulture covers production of irrigated horticultural crops on plants with long life-cycles (typically trees, shrubs or woody vines). Included are orchard crops (e.g. apples, citrus, stone fruit, avocados, nuts, etc.) and vineyard crops (e.g. grapes and kiwifruit). Although the plants are perennial, crops are harvested annually. \n\nThe assumptions for the land use as assessed include: \n• crops are grown for commercial production \n• plants are deep-rooted with roots typically extending to depths of 100 cm or more \n• plants are irrigated using drip, micro-jet or mini-sprinkler systems \n• fertilisers and herbicides, fungicides and/or pesticides are broadcast at least annually \n• mechanised cultivation occurs only during crop establishment \n• weeds are controlled by mowing, slashing or sprays \n• machinery access to the crop is required for spraying, pruning and/or harvesting \n• considers physical requirements only and ignores socio-economic factors.\n\nLand capability refers to the ability of land to support a type of land use without causing damage. \n\nSee DAFWA Resource Management Technical Report 298 for a description of the qualities assessed and the methodology involved.\n\nCapability ratings do not take into account factors such as the availability and quality of water supplies for irrigation or climatic risks such as frost or heat stress. Such factors need to be considered as a separate layer of information.",

The LRA dataset identifies land that is to be acquired for a public purpose. The dataset identifies the purpose for which the land is to be acquired and the relevant authority. Public purposes can include roads, recreational and open spaces and national parks.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards.

    "description": "\nThis layer contains information on the distribution and vegetation types of High Country Sphagnum Bogs and Fens in the ACT as defined by Nature Conservation (High Country Bogs and Associated Fens) Conservation Advice 2019 (Nature Conservation Act). The dataset includes areas of RAMSAR significance. The threatened Northern Corroboree Frogs are also associated with these ecosystems. Veg mapping was undertaken by Geoff Hope et al in 2009 and later revisited during mapping of ACT Vegetation Communities in 2015-2018 (Baines et al 2018).\nThe ACT Scientific Committee determined that the ecological community High Country Bogs and Associated Fens is eligible for inclusion in the ACT Threatened Ecological Communities List in 2019. Most ACT High Country Bogs and Associated Fens communities are consistent with the nationally listed Alpine Sphagnum Bogs and Associated Fens ecological community.\nThe mountains of the Australian Capital Territory support substantial areas of peat-forming mires in interfluves and valley heads, as well as areas of riparian fen vegetation along streams. While similar fens and bogs occur in the Snowy Mountains, the ACT represents a significant outlier of major biogeographic significance because the mires are near their climatic limits and hence sensitive to climate change.\nMapping of the mires was originally completed by Hope et al 2009. The mapping was developed in three stages using orthorectified aerial photography and satellite imagery and extensive field checking. More information can be found at: Hope, G., Nanson, R. and Flett, I. 2009. Technical Report 19. The peat-forming mires of the Australian Capital Territory. Territory and Municipal Services, Canberra. <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2539595/19-peat-forming-mires-of-the-act-2009.pdf\">https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2539595/19-peat-forming-mires-of-the-act-2009.pdf</a>\nKey plant communities of ACT Bogs and Fens (Armstrong et al. 2012):\n•   a2: Baeckea gunniana – Epacris paludosa – Richea continentis – Sphagnum cristatum Wet Heathland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Bog).\n•   a7: Ranunculus pimpinellifolius – Gonocarpus micranthus herbfield of wetland heathland of the Australian Alps bioregion (Bog).\n• a8: Carex gaudichaudiana – Myriophyllum pedunculatum – Deschampsia caespitosa Sedgeland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Fen).\n•   a9: Carex gaudichaudiana – Ranunculus amphitrichus – Phragmites australis Aquatic Herbfield of waterways in the Australian Alps and South-Eastern Highlands Bioregion (Montane Bogs and Fens).\nOther key plant communities (Hope et al. 2009):\n•   Empodisma minus restiad Fen.\n•   Phragmites – Typha tall sedgelands (Fen).\nAssociated plant communities (Armstrong et al. 2012):\n•  a14: Poa costiniana – Carex gaudichaudiana Subalpine Valley Grassland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Grasslands/Herbfields).\n•   e59: Hakea microcarpa – Baeckea utilis – Leptospermum myrtifolium Subalpine Wet Heathland on Escarpment and Eastern Tableland Ranges of the South-Eastern Highlands Bioregion.\n• u193: Hakea microcarpa – Epacris breviflora – Epacris paludosa Montane Wet Heathland of the Australian Alps and western South-Eastern Highlands Bioregions.\nNote this product includes some areas of a33 vegetation community, which is formally considered to be associated with the threatened community (see ACT High Country Bogs and Fens Action Plan 2024, ACT Government). However, these areas were originally mapped by Hope et al 2009 with high altitude sphagnum bog (HSB) present.\nFor more information on ACT High Country Bogs and Fens, visit <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens</a>\nUpdates: Majority of the mapping was completed post 2003 fires. However, the dataset is was updated using Near Infrared Imagery 2015 and LiDAR data in 2019. Further updates will be implemented as required if new or better mapping of bog and fen areas become available.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:3,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for showing presence of bogs and fens in the ACT. Exact boundaries and extents will contract and expand throughout time. This should be considered if data use purpose requires accuracy of greater than 50m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors. © ACT Government",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2014 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 1,126,441 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either:  \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed.  \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2014 car parking event data there are 3,377 records where the parking event goes into 2015 and ends at midnight.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/t6hb-9uf2.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.56GB, 51.5 million rows)",

    "description": "A geological investigation of the Maranboy Tin Field was commenced by officers of the Bureau of Mineral Resources in May, 1951. The object of the survey is, primarily, to obtain a detailed preliminary assessment of the potential ore reserves of the field. Geological mapping and sampling of the major lode lines has been carried out in an attempt to determine the features which control ore deposition and to enable estimates to be prepared of the grade and tonnage of ore per vertical foot, which may be expected from these lode lines. The main emphasis of this work during the 1951 field season was on the major producing lines in what has been called the Southern Field, the Main Lode and part of the Stannum King lode. In addition to this programme, an area of approximately nine square miles was mapped in detail using aerial photographs. Approximately 1,000 square miles of the area surrounding Maranboy was mapped on a regional basis.\n\nThe history of the field, general geology, and the geology of the individual lodes are discussed in this report. The accompanying maps are enclosed.",

    "description": "All designated neighbourhood government schools (referred to as a local school) have a school zone. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English language schools, selective entry high schools, or community schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nEvery Victorian student has the legislated right to enrol at their local government school. A school zone does not restrict a student’s choice to seek enrolment at other government schools. Students can enrol at a school outside their zone if the school has sufficient accommodation and it aligns with the school’s enrolment management implementation plan, where applicable.\nFor students residing in metropolitan Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the local school is usually the nearest government school in a straight line from the child’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is usually the nearest school by the shortest practical route, recognising the additional travel distances often experienced in regional settings.\nIt is recognised that some school zones need to be aligned with geographical and structural barriers that significantly impede direct school access such as rivers and freeways. A main road with pedestrian crossings, however, is not usually considered to be a barrier to accessing a school.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect new schools opening, changing provision at existing schools (e.g., relocating a campus or changing year levels offered), improving school accessibility, or managing enrolment demand.\nThe school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website. More information on Victorian school zones can found at https://www.vic.gov.au/school-zones.\nSchool zones have been produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. The location point for all government schools is taken from the department’s register of school locations. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset have been used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

All proposed development within the Jandakot Groundwater Protection Area should be consistent with Tables 1, 2 and 3 which set out appropriate land uses and activities within the assigned priority area.\n\nPriority areas may change from time to time. The relevant priority areas and wellhead protection zones within the Jandakot Groundwater Protection area can be found on the Department of Planning’s PlanWA interactive planning map.\n\nFor any enquiries regarding the policy, contact waterpolicies@planning.wa.gov.au.",

    "description": "<b>Version 1 February 2016</b> \nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nFor more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/subsite.aspx?id=139941\">helpful information sheets</a> or contact Council. \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Further details on the Qld Planning Provisions can be found <a href=\"http://www.dilgp.qld.gov.au/planning/state-planning-instruments/queensland-planning-provisions.html\">here</a>.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "Core MD88-784 was recovered during the French ASPARA IV cruise in 1988, aboard the Marion Dufresne. The core was located on the Tasman Fracture Zone of the Mid-Ocean Ridge, within the Polar Front Zone.  \n\nIsotopic analysis was performed on tests of the planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (200-250um), and indicate that the core contains isotope stages 1 to 3. The base of the core is found to reach the oxygen isotope stage 3-4 boundary. \n\nThe core is considered to have lost the uppermost section of the core that converts the last 3kyr against the SPECMAP stack. The results also indicate that the Holocene period has the highest rates of sedimentation observed through time. Further variations (excluding isotope-stage 1) appear to indicate that a reduction of the sedimentation rate occurred during the interglacial periods, in contrast to that of the glacials.",

Fourtytwo sources have been discovered in targeted observations of Fermi unidentified point sources, two towards Supernova Remnants, 19 in the Magellanic Clouds, 105 in Globular Clusters and 81 in a survey of the Galactic plane. A large fraction of the new discoveries are recycled pulsars (including a few relativistic systems and several 'spider' binaries), or young pulsars. Timing observations have an essential role in exploiting the full potential of any pulsar discovery, allowing for the precise measurement of rotational, astrometric and orbital parameters which, in turn, give us powerful tools to improve our understanding of the physics in extreme environments as well as of the population of neutron stars as a whole. The UWL receiver of the Parkes telescope is a sensitive, versatile instrument that is allowing us to successfully time these new sources, in the bright-end of TRAPUM discoveries.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "title": "Seagrass proliferation precedes mortality during hypo-salinity events: a stress-induced morphometric response (NERP TE 5.3, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of one data file from a 10 week aquarium experiment manipulating salinity and measuring density, reproduction and growth responses of three tropical Indo-pacific seagrass species (Zostera mueller, Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis). \n\nHalophytes, such as seagrasses, predominantly form habitats in coastal and estuarine areas. These habitats can be seasonally exposed to hypo-salinity events during watershed runoff exposing them to dramatic salinity shifts and osmotic shock. The manifestation of this osmotic shock on seagrass morphology and phenology was tested.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nHypo-salinity exposure experiments were conducted on three species of seagrass, which are ubiquitous throughout the Indo-Pacific, except Zostera muelleri Irmisch ex Ascherson, which is widespread in Australia and New Zealand only. Halodule uninervis (Forsskål) Ascherson is a tropical species that occurs throughout the Indo-West Pacific in coastal and reef habitats, while Halophila ovalis R. Brown is one of the most broadly distributed seagrass species occurring throughout the Indo-West Pacific, including temperate regions, and can be found in estuarine, reef and deepwater habitats (Waycott et al., 2004). Their habitats are periodically exposed to flood plumes of reduced salinity (Furnas, 2003). Both Z. muelleri and H. uninervis are species with linear leaf blades (blady), whereas H. ovalis has pairs of ovate leaves arising from the rhizome on petioles.\n\nZostera muelleri plants were collected from Pelican Banks, Gladstone (23º45.895¿S, 151º18.244¿E) during low tide three months before the experiments started. The plants were collected using a 10 cm corer, with sediment and rhizome and roots collected intact. The cores were placed in plastic-lined pots, the plastic bag sealed over the top of the seagrass with 2 ¿ 3 cm of water during transport to the experimental facility. Halodule uninervis and H. ovalis plants were collected from Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island (19º10.612S, 146º49.737E) using the same technique two months prior to the experiments. The plants were kept in 1000L aquaria at the Aquaculture facility in James Cook University on a closed circulation system in seawater piped from Bowling Green Bay seawater intake under a 30% light-reducing roof. \n\nThe experiment consisted of 12 salinity treatments, starting from 3 PSU and increasing by 3 PSU to 36 PSU (approximate marine seawater). Salinity treatments were obtained by diluting the seawater with de-chlorinated freshwater. Every salinity treatment consisted of four replicate tanks (65L KiTab clear plastic containers) with one pot of each species per tank (i.e. n = 4). All treatments started at 36 PSU and salinity was reduced by 25% each day over four days to the target treatment salinity to mimic the more gradual decline in salinities that occur during run-off events and to minimize potential impacts from shock osmotic changes. Throughout the experiment, salinity was measured every 1-3 days using a digital salinity/conductivity/temperature meter (YSI, model 63) and salinity was adjusted when necessary to maintain salinity within 0.5 PSU of target salinity. Plant responses to these salinities were monitored for 10 weeks. Previous salinity studies indicate that seagrass changes settle down by this time (Griffin and Durako, 2012; Koch et al., 2007), and furthermore, this experimental duration is approximately equal to or more likely exceeds the length of individual hypo-salinity events in the region.\n\nThe experiments were conducted outdoors during summer/autumn months (February to April) when high ambient temperatures occur, thus chilling units were installed to moderate temperature fluctuations within the treatment tanks throughout the experiment. There were three chilled freshwater baths (1000L tanks) that were cooled using external water chillers. Each of the 12 salinity treatments had one 60L sump (60L plastic bin) that was placed randomly in one of the 3 chilling baths, each bath containing 4 sumps. The chilled baths with sumps were held underneath tables that held the experimental tanks. From each sump, water with corresponding salinity was pumped into four replicate tanks resulting in a total of 48 tanks (4 replicate tanks x 12 sumps/salinity treatments = 48 tanks in total). Each tank contained one pot of each of the three species (48 tanks x 3 species/pots = 144 pots). Temperature was recorded every 30 mins using iBCod 22L model of iBTag¿ in six randomly selected tanks for the duration of the experiment. Water temperature was 26°C on average and ranged from 22°C to 34°C reaching these temperature extremes for short periods (1-2 h) on some days. Nitrogen (N) as NH4Cl and phosphate (P) as KH2PO4 were added to the water column at very low concentrations to increase concentrations within each system by 0.05 µMol of P and 1.0 µMol of N every 2 weeks. Nutrient concentration was measured after six weeks and was found to be 0.8 µMol (±0.2) NH3, 0.4 µMol (±0.1) NOx, and 0.2 µMol (±0.8) PO4. Average light intensity under the 30% light-reducing roof was 17 mol photons m-2 d-1 of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), measured with an Odyssey 2Pi quantum sensor (Dataflow, Odyssey photosynthetic recording system) recording every 30 mins throughout the experimental period. The tanks were periodically cleaned by syphoning out sediment and organic matter accumulating at the bottom of tanks and plants were inspected every week for signs of grazing by amphipods. Amphipods were removed to prevent an outbreak, which could lead to overgrazing of the plants. Although signs of grazing were observed at times, this cleaning regime was sufficient to avoid outbreaks.\n\nThe number of shoots in each pot for Z. muelleri and H. uninervis, or the number of leaf pairs for H. ovalis were counted prior to the experiment and then weekly during the first four weeks of the experiment and fortnightly from the sixth week up to and including the tenth week. Change in shoot density (deltaSht) was calculated as a percentage change in each week relative to pre-treatment for each individual replicate:\n              deltaSht=[(Sht tx-Sht t0 )/Sht t0 ]×100\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEq 1\nwhere deltaSht is change in shoot density, Sht tx is shoot density at time x (weeks 1 through to 10) and Sht t0 is shoot density at week zero (pre-treatment).\n\nLeaf morphometrics (width and height) of Z. muelleri, H. uninervis and H. ovalis and number of leaves per shoot for the two blady species were measured after 10 weeks at treatment salinity. These data were used to calculate foliar surface area (SA) as follows:\n                SA=shoot density × (leaves per shoot-0.5)  × leaf length × leaf width\t\tEq 2\nfor blady species (H. uninervis and Z. muelleri); and,\n                SA=leaf density × pi × ((leaf length)/2)  × ((leaf width)/2)\t\t\t\t\tEq 3\nfor the ovate species H. ovalis where: \nSA is the foliar leaf area (cm2), \nshoot density are leaves per experimental pot,\nleaves per shoot are the mean number of leaves (usually 1 to 4) per seagrass shoot and \nleaf length (cm) and leaf width (cm) of the youngest fully mature leaf. \n\nA half leaf was subtracted from the total number of leaves per shoot in calculating SA of blady species to account for one leaf on each shoot being in development and therefore not full sized (Collier et al., 2012). \n\nHalophila ovalis was the only species to flower throughout the experimental period. Flowering had commenced prior to the initiation of the experiment and continued throughout. New leaf pairs are produced in H. ovalis every 3 or 4 days at experimental water temperatures (~26 - 27°C McMahon, 2005) and H. ovalis typically had 4 to 5 leaf pairs per branch. Flowering is initiated in young leaf pairs, with more advanced reproductive structures away from the growing apex. Assuming a leaf pair production rate of 4 days, we conservatively assumed that all reproductive structures present after 4 weeks (28 d) were initiated under treatment conditions. We counted all reproductive structures (male and female flowers, as well as fruits) in each pot at weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10. \n\nLeaf growth rate was measured in week 10 on the two blady species (Z. muelleri and H. uninervis) using the leaf hole punch method (McMahon, 2005). Holes were punched using a hypodermic needle in the top of the sheath of each shoot, and after 5 ¿ 7 days we measured the distance between the mark in the sheath and the mark on the leaves. We aimed to measure up to 10 shoots per replicate pot, though the actual number measured in each pot was variable depending on shoot density and visibility of marks.\n \nFor more details see the publication:\n\nCollier, C.

This will secure long-term protection of biodiversity and associated environmental values. The policy recognises the protection and management of significant bushland areas as a fundamental consideration in the planning process, while also seeking to integrate and balance wider environmental, social and economic considerations. In general terms, the policy does not prevent development where it consistent with the policy measures in this policy and other planning and environmental considerations.\n\nThe three key objectives of this policy are:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nto establish a conservation system at the regional level (through Bush Forever areas and to operate with the clearing controls under the Environmental Protection Act 1986) that is, as far as is achievable, comprehensive, adequate and representative of the ecological communities of the Swan Coastal Plain portion of the Perth Metropolitan Region; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nto seek to protect and manage significant bushland recommended for protection and management for conservation purposes through a range of implementation mechanisms and as a collective and shared responsibility and general duty of care on the part of government, landowners and the community; and \n</li>\n<li>\n\nto provide a policy and implementation framework for significant bushland areas recommended for protection and management to assist conservation planning, planning assessment and decision-making processes.\n</li>\n</ul>",

This data includes Orthomosaic, DSM, DTM, Elevation Contours, 3D Mesh, 3D Point Cloud and LiDAR constructed from over 500 images and LiDAR sensor captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh\nThis LiDAR dataset is a 3D point cloud (i.e. a 3D set of points in .LAS format): the X,Y,Z position and colour information is stored for each point of the point cloud of the Floreat dog beach (2021 Flight-1 project area).",

They include areas of sediment supply (sources), sediment loss (sinks), and the sediment transport processes linking them (pathways). Sediment transport pathways include both alongshore and cross-shore processes, and therefore cells are best represented in two-dimensions.

Serial Number - YC030001\nFocal Length - 69.8261mm\nImagery Type - RGB\nAcquisition Date(s) - North-South runs: 15th, 16th, 17th, 22nd &amp; 23rd July 2019 Tie/coastal strips: 22nd &amp; 23rd July 2019\nFlying Height (above MSL) - Approx 3000ft MSL for 6cm resolution, but variable due to terrain.\nCapture Methodology - Primary Runs - 95, Secondary/Tie Runs - 10\nForward / Side Overlap (%) - 70 / 40\n\n<b>Orthosmosaic</b>\n\nA digital orthophoto is a raster image of remotely sensed data in which displacement in the image due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been corrected (orthorectification). Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - &lt;3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)*\nSpatial Accuracy Notes - Based on check against selected visible survey marker coordinates (Type ‘minimark’ and ‘STAND’ with CLASS A, B, C, D) downloaded from QLDSpatial website.  Final imagery checked and accuracy verified against available cadastral data with sub 1m accuracy (B&amp;D ENTRY CONTROLLED - 0.1M, 0.25M, 0.3M, 0.5M, 1M\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - Utilised 1m Lidar DSM downloaded from https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/.  The DSM was not manually edited and no 3D  Breaklines were mapped.  In areas of disturbance or obvious terrain change eg. Mines/quarries etc, a new DSM was generated via stereo photogrammetric techniques at ½ full image resolution. The photogrammetric DSM was filtered using automated building and vegetation filter algorithms to remove some (but not all) above ground features. The filtered DSM was then gaussian smoothed and resampled to 1m resolution to match the LIDAR DTM.\nRectification Surface Accuracy Vertical - +/- 0.15m @ 67 % CI for client supplied LIDAR DTM, as per client metadata for dataset (not independently verified)\nRectification Surface Accuracy Horizontal - +/- 0.3m @ 67 % CI, as per client metadata for dataset (not verified)\nTile Size / Grid - 1km2\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2016.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",
