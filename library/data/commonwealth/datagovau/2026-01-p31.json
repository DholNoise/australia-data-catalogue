    "description": "This layer describes the stormwater priority areas for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Stormwater priority areas were determined by a combination of decision support tools and the co-design process. The decision support tool used was Zonation, which prioritised management actions across the region with the objective of improving instream habitat suitability for platypus, fish and macroinvertebrates. The stormwater priority area polygons were created by merging sub-catchments from University of Melbourne’s subc layer, i.e. the network of sub-catchments used for assessing attenuated imperviousness and for habitat suitability modelling. \n\n\n\nPrimary purpose for this data is identifying stormwater priority areas of Melbourne Water's Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This dataset covers the Greater Melbourne region with the stormwater priority areas presented in this dataset aligning with the priorities of the Melbourne Water Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. However, it is important to note that stormwater management activities require additional judgement to consider whether areas beyond (e.g. upstream) of the priority areas identified will also require treatment to achieve the desired waterway health outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe harvesting and infiltration targets presented in this dataset provide an estimate of what is required to achieve stormwater disconnection and recreation of the natural hydrology. However, is should be noted that these values are approximate only and do not replace site-specific investigations. The values have been calculated in reference to Walsh et al. 2012 , who presented target ranges for infiltration and harvesting required to achieve urban stormwater disconnection (i.e. re-creation of forested/vegetated hydrology). The values presented are the average of the ranges estimated by Walsh et al. 2012. These values do not replace a detailed site investigation. Site-specific factors (soil type, topography, geology and other hydrological features of the catchment) will influence the appropriate targets for a site.\n\n\n\nFor further reading on the prioritisation process see:\n\n<ul><li>Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership</li><li>Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document. Each priority area contains targets for harvesting and infiltration. Achievement of these targets is required to achieve stormwater disconnection. These targets are presented in two ways: per impervious hectare, and total volume to full urban development (i.e. complete urban development to the urban growth boundary). It should be noted that these targets are approximate values only and do not replace site-specific studies. See notes above about how target values were selected.</li></ul>\n\nFor further reading, see: Walsh, C. J., Fletcher, T. D., &amp; Burns, M. J. (2012).

It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from the 2011-12 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Australian Health Survey (AHS): National Health Measures Survey.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nPopulation in this dataset refers to 'population at risk' as modelled by the ABS. For more information, see the Explainatory Notes.\n\n\nCKD prevalence estimates are based on measures of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) to identify biomedical signs of CKD.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Dart Point in the east, to Callala Beach(S) in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 6 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Chemical digestion of the polycarbonate filter enabled us to determine the particulate silicon concentration for each sample (using the nutrient autoanalyser onboard the Aurora Australis, see hydrochemistry section), fibreglass filters have been dried and stored for CHN analysis back on shore.\n      \n      This work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2655 and 2679 (ASAC_2655, ASAC_2679).",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "Geographic location of the outer margin of the Antarctic ice cover for the sector between longitudes 79E and 108E, including margins of ice shelves, glaciers, and iceberg tongues.  The data set does not in general include the grounding zone at the inland margin of the ice shelves or glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe margin was defined by interpretation of an image mosaic generated from Synthetic Aperture Radar data.  The image mosaic was built using navigation data accompanying the SAR images to transform the images to a map projection. The image navigation data were adjusted so that overlapping images were registered to one another, the indivual images merged into a mosaic, and the overall process adjusted so that the mosaic was tied to the few ground control points available in this large sector.  Two separate mosaics were used to span the whole sector.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the SAR data were acquired by the ERS-SAR instruments in August 1996, some ERS data were acquired in August 1993, and one Radarsat scene was acquired in September 1997.  The data were pre-processed to produce a mosaic with a 100 m pixel size, and adjusted so that the majority of the coastline positions refer to the August 1996 epoch.\r\n\r\nThe location data are internally consistent, and extracted at nominally 200 m intervals.  The external position accuracy is generally better than 600 m. The coverage is complete over the whole sector.  The coordinate set includes some island/ice rise features.  Two very large grounded icebergs are included.\r\n\r\nData are in an ascii arc/info export file format as geographic coordinates on the ITRF1996 system and contains attribute information.\r\n\r\nERS-SAR data, copyright ESA, 1993, 1996\r\n\r\nRadarsat data, copyright Canadian Space Agency, Agence spatiale canadienne, 1997.\r\n\r\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 454, 1125 and 2224 (ASAC_454, ASAC_1125 and ASAC_2224).",

    "description": "A 6m steel pole has been installed within a small bommie within Second Lagoon of One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the second lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the second lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity. The pole is available for mounting of additional third part instruments and so forms an infrastructure to support future observational work at the Island.",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who have high blood pressure. High blood pressure (or hypertension), is defined as including any of the following; systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg, or; diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg, or; receiving medication for high blood pressure. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "Preservation is defined as the capacity for coastal blue carbon decomposition to be inhibited due to saline anaerobic conditions, and for long-term sequestration within soils. Fine-grained sediments typical of alluvial floodplains, fluvial deltas and to some extent estuarine floodplains will inhibit decomposition more than sandy coastal barrier sediments (Saintilan et al., 2013) and carbon will be more concentrated in these regions. Due to significant decline in hydrodynamic energy as tributaries enter estuaries, fluvial deltas are composed predominantly of finer grain sizes (although pro-delta and delta fronts may have highly variable grain sizes) yet are influenced by tidal inundation resulting in saline conditions ideal for ongoing preservation of stored carbon. Coastal barrier sediments that are typically dominated by sands store less carbon due to greater oxidation of sediments (Kelleway et al., 2016) and in some locations, frequent reworking. \nSaintilan, N., Rogers, K., Mazumder, D., and Woodroffe, C. (2013). Allochthonous and autochthonous contributions to carbon accumulation and carbon store in southeastern Australian coastal wetlands. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 128, 84-92.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to map each groundwater works with the volumetric entitlement without double counting the volume and to aggregate/ disaggregate the data depending on the final use.\n\n\n\nThis has not been clipped to the CLM PAE, therefore the number of economic assets/ relevant licences will drastically reduce once this occurs. \n\n\n\nThe Clarence Moreton groundwater licences includes an extract of all licences that fell within the data management acquisition area as provided by BA to NSW Office of Water.\n\n\n\nAim: To get a one to one ratio of licences numbers to bore IDs. \n\nImportant notes about data:\n\nData has not been clipped to the PAE.\n\n\n\nClarence Moreton worksheet links the individual licence to a works and a volumetric entitlement. For most sites, this can be linked to a bore which can be found in the NGIS through the HydroID. (National_Groundwater_Information_System_v1.1_Sept2013 GUID = e157b1cd-3cb7-4cf9-a13c-a6bed576b8c7). This will allow analysis of depths, lithology and hydrostratigraphy where the data exists.\n\nWe can aggregate the data based on water source and water management zone as can be seen in the other worksheets. \n\n\n\nData available: \n\n\n\nOriginal Data: Any data that was bought in from NSW Offcie of Water, includes\n\nSpatial locations provided by NoW- This is a exported data from the submitted shape files. Includes the licence (LICENCE) numbers and the bore ID (WORK_NUO). (Refer to lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Entitlements Spatial Locations).\n\nSpreadsheet_WAL - The spread sheet from the submitted data, WLS-EXTRACT_WALs_volume. (Refer to Lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract CLM- Oct 2013)\n\nWLS_extracts - The combined spread sheets from the submitted data, WLS-EXTRACT .  (Refer to Lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract CLM- Oct 2013)\n\n\n\nProcessed Data: The two final products, includes\n\nCLM_Draft - this includes cancelled licences and licences where the old licence has been replaced by a share component (essentially a repeat)\n\nCLM_final- The final working linking all licences to bore IDs, removal of cancelled licences and licences that have been replaced in the new WaterAct. Also includes the volume of the licence per works \n\nAggregated share component to water sharing plan, water source and water management zone\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nNo decision have been made in regards to what purpose of groundwater should be protected. Therefore the purpose currently includes groundwater bores that have been drilled for non-extractive purposes including experimental research, test, monitoring bore, teaching, mineral explore and groundwater explore\n\nNo volume has been included for domestic & stock as it is a basic right. Therefore an arbitrary volume could be applied to account for D&S use.\n\nLicence Number - Each sheet in the Original Data has a licence number, this is assumed to be the actual licence number. Some are old  because they have not been updated to the new WA. Some are new (From_Spreadsheet_WALs). This is the reason for the different codes.\n\nWA/CA - This number is the 'works' number. It is assumed that the number indicates the bore permit or works approval. This is why there can be multiple works to licence and licences to works number.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nProcedure: \n\n\n\n1) Original spread sheets from the licence extract ( GUID d9bd77b6-5bc3-4832-a212-0e8f5ba48076) have mulitple licence instances if there are more than one WA/CA (works) number. This means that there are more than one works or permit to the licence. The aim is to only have one licence instance. \n\n\n\n2) The individual licence numbers were combined into one column \n\n\n\n3) Using the new column of licence numbers, several vlookups were created to bring in other data. Where the columns are identical in the original spreadsheets, they are combined. The only ones that dont are the Share/Entitlement/allocation, these mean different things. \n\n\n\n4) A hydro ID column was created, this is a code that links this NSW to the NGIS, which is basically a \".1.1\" at the end of the bore code.\n\n\n\n5) All 'cancelled' licences were removed\n\n\n\n6) A count of the number of works per licence and number of bores were included in the spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n7) Where the ShareComponent = NA, the Entitlement = 0, Allocation = 0 and there was more than one instance of the same bore, this means that the original licence assigned to the bore has been replaced by a new licence with a share component. Where these criteria were met, the instances were removed\n\n\n\n8) a volume per works ensures that the volume of the licence is not repeated for each works, but is divided by the number of works\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the Bioregional assessment data conversion script for methodology.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) CLM16gwl NSW Office of Water, GW licence extract linked to spatial locations in CLM v2 28022014.

    "description": "This data was collected in November 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V07.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, Nov 21, 2011\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, Nov 27, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the location of point features representing entries into the Australian Building Energy Efficiency Register spanning the years of 2011 to 2019. The data includes entries related to NABERS ratings, Tenancy Lighting Assessments and Building Energy Efficiency Certificates under the Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) program. Entries are based upon each functional space within a building, so multiples entries may be recorded for a single point location.\nThe CBD Program is an initiative of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). It was established by the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010 and is managed by the Australian Government. The CBD Program is a regulatory program that requires energy efficiency information to be provided in most cases when commercial office space of 1,000 square metres or more is offered for sale or lease. The aim is to improve the energy efficiency of Australia's large office buildings and to ensure prospective buyers and tenants are informed. The CBD Downloadable Data Set is a compilation of the entire Building Energy Efficiency Register since its commencement in 2011 into a downloadable form updated on a weekly basis.  \nFor more information, please visit:\n\n\nCommercial Building Disclosure - Downloadable Dataset.\n\n\nCommercial Building Disclosure - Frequently Asked Questions.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this dataset.\n\n\nWhile the Australian Government uses reasonable endeavours to monitor the quality of information available on the CBD website and to update this information regularly, it does not guarantee, and accepts no legal liability whatsoever arising from, or in connection with, the accuracy, reliability, currency or completeness of any material contained on this website or on any linked site.\n\n\nThe Australian Government recommends that users exercise their own skill and care with respect to their use of the CBD website, and the information contained in the CBD Downloadable Data Set.\n\n",

If you have an ongoing requirement to use the statistics, to meet a legislative or policy requirement, please seek advice from the relevant WA Government Department or Authority rather than contacting the Data Custodians listed under Key Information. If you use the reports, please include a caveat stating the following: (1) year of currency, (2) a statement that the statistics presented may now be out of date, and (3) the report citation.\nImportant update (October 2025):\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) have updated the remnant vegetation mapping and statistics for the Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes and, they are available on DataWA. Please refer to the Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics available at:\nhttps://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-region-schemes-2024-remnant-vegetation-statistics\nThe Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics provide status of remnant vegetation for the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion, the Metropolitan, Peel and portion of the Greater Bunbury Region Scheme areas, and local government areas within these regions.\nThe mapping and statistics for the South West Forest outside of the Perth and Peel Region Schemes have not been updated by DWER.\nOverview of the Report\nFrom 2016 to 2018, DBCA provided annual updates of statistics on the pre-European and current extent of the vegetation complexes of the south-west of Western Australia and are based on more detailed vegetation complex mapping than the Statewide vegetation association mapping. The statistics were used for several purposes including conservation planning, land use planning and when assessing development applications.\nThe statistics provided a general overview of the status of vegetation complexes, noting the limitations detailed in the README document relating to scale, remnant vegetation mapping and currency of the analysis. They were intended to be used in conjunction with other information on the biodiversity values of an area and with input and advice from people familiar with the vegetation complex and the vegetation condition of an area of interest.\nFor the Swan Coastal Plain and South-West Forests regions, three reports are included:\n· CAR Report - provides information on the progress towards achieving a conservation reserve system that is comprehensive, adequate, and representative (CAR Reserve Analysis);\n· Region Scheme Report – provides supporting statistics regarding EPA policies for Region Scheme areas;\n· LGA Report – summary statistics for each LGA.\nA CAR system of reserves helps conserve our biodiversity. Please contact DBCA for advice on the CAR statistics.",

    "description": "Version 2 minor revision 27 June 2024.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest compilation of land use mapping information for Australia’s regions as at December 2023. The land use data are supported by a supplementary commodities dataset, containing extra information on the location of select predominantly agricultural commodities. These datasets replace the previous 2020 December updates. \r\nVersion 2 fixes issues caused during the conversion of the state vector datasets to rasters, where single pixel horizontal lines were generated in local areas. This does not affect the date or scale of mapping.\r\n\r\nThese data were compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs and other authoritative sources through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). These datasets are not recommended for change analysis or for national land use statistics—instead use the Land use of Australia 2010-11 to 2015-16.\r\n\r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n\r\nA seamless raster dataset that combines land use vector data for all state and territory jurisdictions, at a spatial resolution of 50 by 50 metres.\r\nShows a single dominant land use for each location, based on the management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies).\r\nUpdates have been made to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, the capital city of Adelaide, parts of the Great Barrier Reef NRM regions, and national updates to select horticultural tree crops and protected cropping structures. There are also minor corrections to Western Australia, and more accurate representation of mining areas in South Australia.  \r\nThe date of mapping (2008 to 2023) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary and are provided as supporting datasets. \r\nProduced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. \r\nRefer to the metadata and ABARES website for additional information.\r\n \r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n- Provides location, extent and year verified for 185 commodities, where mapped, as a vector dataset. \r\n- Commodity data are validated in the field and using other sources.\r\n- Generally, a single commodity is shown at a location reflecting the most recent date that location was verified.\r\n- The location of a commodity may change on a seasonal to annual basis, depending on factors such as climate, markets or farming systems.\r\n- Not nationally complete or comprehensive, and with various dates of capture (1967 to 2023) and input mapping products (2014 to 2023). \r\n- Refer to the metadata for additional information.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n- Land use: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 version 2, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, June, CC BY 4.0, DOI: 10.25814/2w2p-ph98\r\n- Commodities: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "In 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to fly an airborne laser scanning survey (LiDAR) of Christmas Island. The survey was carried out using a fixed wing aircraft between the 24th and 26th of August 2011. All data was captured within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.5m to 1.2m.\nAAM classified the raw LiDAR points into the following classes using a single algorithm across the project area:\n0 Unclassified - Created, never classified\n1 Default - Unclassified\n2 Ground - Bare ground\n3 Low vegetation - 0 – 0.3m (essentially sensor 'noise')\n4 Medium vegetation - 0.3 – 2m\n5 High vegetation - 2m &gt;\n6 Buildings, structures - Buildings, houses, sheds, silos etc.\n7 Low / high points - Spurious high/low point returns (unusable)\n8 Model key points - Reserved for ‘model key points’ only\n9 Water - Any point in water\n10 Bridge - Any bridge or overpass\n11 not used - Reserved for future definition\n12 Overlap points - Flight line overlap points\nThe raw LiDAR points in the .las format were provided to Geoscience Australia along with 1km ESRI grid tiles generated by interpolation from the points. The tiles were then joined to create a DEM (TIFF) that covers the full extent of Christmas Island. Each cell, 1m x 1m, in the grid contains the height in metres of the ground surface. As a guide, the DEM data is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm. Manual checking and editing was carried out by AAM to improve accuracy. Positional accuracy has been checked by Geoscience Australia and was found to match the ground surface well.\nThe DEM data is complete for the full extent of Christmas Island.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "Sediment cells are spatially discrete areas of the coast within which marine and terrestrial landforms are likely to be connected through processes of sediment exchange, often described using sediment budgets. They include areas of sediment supply (sources), sediment loss (sinks), and the sediment transport processes linking them (pathways). Sediment transport pathways include both alongshore and cross-shore processes, and therefore cells are best represented in two-dimensions. They are natural management units with a physical basis and commonly cross jurisdictional boundaries. ",

    "description": "A dataset of enrolments (FTE) of all schools in Victoria, based on collections from the February 2023 schools census, including Government and non-Government Schools (Catholic and Independent schools).\nInformation collected from the February school census of Victorian schools: For each school, Full Time Equivalent (FTE) enrolments by school type and year level are included. A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.\nFor this 2023 census year data, the students' sex/gender category is not included for the following reasons:                       \n•   The gender of 'self-described' was implemented at the beginning of 2022 for Victorian government schools. Enrolments with this gender value are collected in the 2023 February School Census results but this value is currently under represented.      \n•   Due to the small numbers of enrolments with the 'self-described' gender, there is the potential for individuals to be identifiable at the school and year level.\n•   The 'self-described' counts are in their infancy and will likely increase over time but at this stage the department deems the risk of possible identification as too high.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\n\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

Loading zones are located and operate at times where there is a demand for a particular activity such as passenger loading or delivering goods.\nBrisbane City Council has passenger set down and pick up loading zones available across the city. The locations of these zones can change over time, so you must check local signs to make sure you do not park illegally.  \n\nThese loading zones allow passengers to be dropped off or picked up without affecting traffic flows.  \n\nIf you park longer in these loading zones, even if you remain in your car, you can be fined. Make sure these spaces are only used to pick up or drop off.\nThe following data is an indicative guide of passenger loading zone locations across Brisbane.

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R2.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January 23, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, January 30, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "    \n\nGross Benefit Salinity (gb97s = p97s a pfe97) ($/ha/yr) dataset is one of 11\nnational surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic\nopportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in\n1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a04.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2017.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Report produced in collaboration between Universities and Commonwealth and State Government agencies.  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  provide national assessments of the status of key wild-capture fish stocks. The reports provide scientifically based stock status assessments for 68 key species (or species complexes), which cumulatively contribute over 90 percent of the value and 85 percent of the volume from Australian fisheries. \r\n• Stock status assessments in the 2014 reports are based on the abundance and level of harvest in 2013. In total, 238 stocks were assessed across the 68 key species; 129 stocks were classified as sustainable, these contribute around 87.5 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. There were 7 stocks classified as transitional-recovering, 19 as transitional-depleting, 11 as overfished and 4 as environmentally limited. There were 68 stocks where status was classified as undefined; these stocks contribute 6.4 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  focus on the status of targeted fish stocks. The status classifications do not consider broader ecosystem impacts of fishing, such as bycatch or habitat impacts, or social and economic considerations. These elements may be included in future editions, or companion reports. \r\n• The reports rely on a consistent national reporting framework that was developed collaboratively by fisheries scientists from around Australia. The framework provides transparency and consistency in stock status reporting across jurisdictions. \r\n• The Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  builds on the 2012 inaugural edition with 19 new species. Four of the new species are caught in Commonwealth fisheries. The additional species were nominated by the states and the Northern Territory as either iconic species that are likely to be seen in retail outlets or historically overfished species. \r\n• There were minor alterations to the national stock status classification framework and species chapters. The main update to the framework is the inclusion of the new environmentally limited stock category. The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  Advisory Group included this additional category to describe stocks depleted below the limit reference point by environmental factors rather than fishing. \r\n• Between 2012 and 2014 there have been a number of changes to stock structure and stock status for some species. In both cases the changes are based on the most recent and reliable information available. \r\n• The reports were developed collaboratively by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) and government fishery research agencies from all states, the Northern Territory and the CSIRO; more than 100 fisheries researchers were involved. \r\n",

    "description": "In early 2011 PRL provided Geoscience Australia with the Old Drill Hole Clearing dataset.\nThis dataset shows the location of old drill lines cleared through the rainforest on Christmas\nIsland. Drill lines were cleared to test the land for phosphate deposits and were cleared from\nthe 1950’s through to the 1970’s, before Phosphate Resources Limited (PRL) began mining\non the island.\nThe Old Drill Hole Clearing dataset has been developed from the Peg and Line grid.   PRL used Surpac to create a road outline 7 m wide (this is the\nestimate of two dozer D6 blades widths) along each of the previous drill lines. They were\nthen stitched together and made into a polygon.\nThere seems to be a good correlation between the extent of the drill lines and evidence of\nclearing from the 1987 orthophotography.\nThe accuracy of the Peg and Line used as a base when the shapefile was produced is of\nrelevance. The error in the data appears to be in the vicinity of 100 metres. As clearing\nboundaries and coast (though highly simplified) of the same map plot in far better position\n(after transformation) in relation to the orthophotographs and other GIS themes, the majority\nof inaccuracy in this theme is probably inherited from the original map (abbsite.dwg). That\nis, it appears that the clearings and coast of abbsite.dwg are reasonably accurate though very\nimprecise (intended to be viewed at much greater scale), while the line and peg grid appears\nless accurate. Thus the grid on the GIS is mainly illustrative at this time.\nThere are no attributes assigned to the data.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Exploring for the Future (EFTF) program is an Australian government initiative aimed at stimulating investment in resource exploration and development. It operates multiple interconnected projects, such as the Australia’s Resources Framework (ARF), a continental-scale endeavor to enhance understanding of Australia's geology and resource potential. A module of ARF, the Geochemistry for Basin Prospectivity (G4BP), studies Australian basins with prospective base metal mineral systems. \n\n\n\nThe current report focuses on the Neoproterozoic segment of the Stuart Shelf region in South Australia, a part of the Adelaide Rift Complex. This research is conducted collaboratively with the Geological Survey of South Australia, examining sediment-hosted copper potential in the rift complex.\n\n\n\nThe Adelaide Rift Complex is a geological formation that underwent extensive sedimentation from the Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian, particularly within the rift zone. Stuart Shelf sediments overlay Mesoproterozoic magmatic and Paleoproterozoic metasediment layers. The complex hosts multiple copper deposits, which are usually associated with movement of basinal brines that leach metals from lower basinal layers or rift-related volcanic rocks.\n\n\n\nTo improve understanding of the geology of the Stuart Shelf and related copper mineralisation, two primary objectives were set: \n\n\n\n1. Geochemical fingerprinting and baseline data collection: This involves compilation and reanalysis of existing data, along with new data collection aimed at providing comprehensive geochemical data for stratigraphic units within the Stuart Shelf.\n\n\n\n2. Identification of mineral system components: Utilising data from the first objective, this phase aims to identify potential metal and fluid sources and potential sites of metal deposition. \n\nIn conjunction with these efforts, a GA-GSSA geochemical sampling project is underway, tying geochemistry to lithostratigraphic units and facies. The newly acquired geochemical data will be integrated into the overall GSSA-CSIRO project to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the sediment-hosted stratabound mineral system.\n\n",

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nBoth the floodway and flood fringe make up the 1 in 100 (1%) annual exceedance probability (AEP) floodplain, however there are areas where the floodplain exists, but the floodway and flood fringe does not. In such situations, a different floodplain management strategy applies (for example, the Swan River between the Narrows and Canning Bridges).\n\nThis dataset comprises two polygons - Flood fringe, and Floodway. The flood fringe is that part of the floodplain where development may be considered acceptable subject to certain building conditions that will provide adequate flood protection. The floodway is that part of the 1 in 100 (1%) AEP floodplain where development that is considered obstructive to major flows is not acceptable as it would increase flood levels upstream. No new buildings are acceptable in the floodway.\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River – Toodyay, Northam, York and Beverley Townsites. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nBlackwood River – Augusta, Bridgetown, Nannup and Boyup Brook Townsites.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nBrunswick River - Greater Bunbury \n</li>\n<li>\n\nCoblinine River &amp; Dorderyemunning Creek - Wagin Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nChapman River – Geraldton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDenmark River – Denmark Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGascoyne River - Carnarvon Townsite and the Lower Gascoyne.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGribble Creek - Kalgoorlie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHarding River - Roebourne Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nIrwin River - Dongara Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLower Collie River - Greater Bunbury.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Donnybrook Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSerpentine River, Peel, Birrega &amp; Oaklands Drains, Murray River and the Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary - Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Pinjarra and south to the Darling Scarp (Murray River) and Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Wellard (Peel Main Drain), east to South Western Highway (Serpentine River) and north to Wungong Brook (Birrega Drain).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Perth - Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River). Tributaries include Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Ellen Brook, Helena River, Henley Brook, Jane Brook, St Leonards Creek, Susannah Brook (Swan River) and Southern River/ Wungong Brook (Canning River).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nToby Inlet – Quindalup Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nVasse-Wonnerup Estuaries, Broadwater and New River - Busselton Townsite.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor further information on flooding and floodplain management in Western Australia please refer to our Water Facts publications: Flooding in Western Australia (Water facts 13) and Floodplain Management (Water facts 14).\n\nThis information is available at the following addresses:\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-13-Flooding-in-Western-Australia.pdf\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFlood fringe - the area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway where development could be permitted provided it is compatible with flood hazard and building conditions provide an adequate level of flood protection. These areas are generally covered by still or very slowly moving waters during a 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodway - the river channel and a portion of the floodplain where a significant flow or storage of water occurs during floods. If the floodway is even partially blocked, then the natural flooding regime of the area may be detrimentally impacted with flood levels being raised and affecting areas which may not have been previously affected. Development in floodways is to be avoided wherever possible.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for December 1988. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

Dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity samples were also collected at selected stations to continue the time series established during previous voyages, with these samples to be analysed on shore by the CSIRO carbon team. Additionally, Thermosalinograph (TSG) samples were continuously collected throughout the voyage, with on-board measurements of their salinity used to calibrate the ship's underway system.\nPlease cite the following manuscript when reporting or publishing data for silicate, phosphate, nitrate+nitrite (NOx) and nitrite:\nRees, C., L.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth and reported smoking tobacco in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and reported smoking in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, divided by the total number of females who gave birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nSmoking refers to the use of cigarettes or inhaled tobacco.\n\n\nData excludes mothers whose smoking status was not stated.\n\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is self-reported smoking of tobacco.\n\n\nBecause of differences in definitions and methods used for data collection, care must be taken when comparing across jursidictions.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3 year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

It is simply the ratio of water volume to soil volume.- ºC: Temperature in degrees celsius.- µS/cm: Salinity is the measure of the concentration of dissolved (soluble) salts in water from all sources. (microseimens per centimetre)Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every hour as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.",

Applied, Approved and Under\nConstruction, and Complete.\n\nSite content is derived from a range of sources\nat various times and as such the content may not be free from errors, omissions\nor defects. Inconsistencies may occur in some data sets. The City of Melbourne\nuses its best endeavours to ensure that the information is reliable.\n\nThe massings in the Sketchup model are\nrepresentational only, sit on a two dimensional planar surface and are not\nintended for analytical or comparative purposes. The massings are derived by\nextruding simplified polygons of an indicative floor plate for the podium (if\nrelevant) and tower. The height data is an approximation of the height of the\nbuilding and does not show the architectural features of the buildings.\n\nUsers can then make an informed decision as to\nwhether the site content is appropriate for their particular purpose and\ninformation needs.\n\nAlthough all due care has been taken to ensure\nthat this data is correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by City of\nMelbourne in its use.\n\n<b>Preview Image:</b>\n\n\n\n<b></b>\n\n<b>Download:</b>\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/3D_DAM_Sketchup/DevelopmentActivityModel.skp\">Download</a> the Development Activity Model as a .skp file.

    "description": "Koalas in the landscape (KITL1.0) enhances the prioritisation of landscape conservation actions for the Koala Strategy. It measures and forecasts the statewide status and trends in population persistence and habitat carrying capacity, considering future climate change based on NARCliM1.0 climate models. The risk of future clearing of koala habitat is not part of the model. The model projects how the current pattern of native vegetation is able to support koalas into future climate.\nSpatial data identifies candidate areas for the establishment and enhancement of habitats that are capable of supporting koalas into the future. The project also identifies where translocating koalas into currently unoccupied regions has a higher likelihood of success.\nFor further detail refer to the KITL1.0 project technical report.\nKITL2.0 is currently under development. It also uses NARCliM1.0 climate models. Future versions of KITL will make use of updated climate and other input data, as it becomes available.",

Previously, students in support classes in mainstream schools were not included.\n\n\nStudents in schools for specific purposes (SSPs) are not included.\n\n\nStudents in distance education and Intensive English Centres are included with their appropriate grade levels.\n\n\nOC classes are not included in secondary students. IEC students are included.\n\n\nIn most scholastic years there are a small number of students in atypical age groups. For students under 18 years, these have been included in the nearest band. This is indicated with an asterisk. As a result, the sum of each row may not equal the totals reported.

The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the _Public Sector Management Act 1994_, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sectors reports is the public sector entity survey (PSES).\r\n\r\nThe 2016 PSES collected information across topics such as the application of _Commissioner’s Instruction No. 7 – Code of Ethics_, codes of conduct and general principles of human resource management, public interest disclosure, equal employment opportunity strategies and agency management at June 2016 or for the 2015/16 financial year. The survey was sent to chief executive officers and chief employees of public sector entities with over 20 full-time equivalents as at December 2015, including Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state. In 2016, 78 public sector entities completed the survey.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2016.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant entities to access online.\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2016 data.xls – individual agency responses to the PSES with a question key and response key. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset.\r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2016 data.sav – individual agency responses to the PSES, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset.\r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of PSES data is available in the State of the sectors statistical bulletin 2016.\r\n",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

The data spans the months of 2013 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nHousehold projections show the number of households that would form if demographic trends continue and if assumptions about living arrangements are realised over the projection period. A household is two or more people who share a dwelling (house, apartment, townhouse, caravan, etc.) and share food and cooking facilities, and other essentials. Household projections show the future number and type of households living in private dwellings. Private dwellings are self-contained accommodation such as houses, apartments, mobile homes or other substantial structures. It does not include accommodation such as boarding houses, nursing homes or prisons.\nThe household projections also include the implied dwelling demand for those households.  This is the likely number of private dwellings needed to accommodate future population-driven demand.\nFor more information please read the Household Projections User Guide.Please note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nHousehold and dwelling numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. They should not be taken to be accurate to that level of detail.\n\n",

Each decision has been stamped and signed by the Secretary to Cabinet. A statement of certification as a correct copy is also stamped.\nThe circulation records include the decision number, location and date of the meeting, subject, submission number (number or oral submission), number of copies made and circulation details (number, name of minister or department, date and time).\nCabinet submissions were intended to lead to cabinet decisions and come in four distinct forms: policy, authority to prepare a Bill, authority to introduce a Bill, and authority to forward significant subordinate legislation. Submissions include the submission number, copy number and the name of the person or department making the submission. Each submission is stamped with the date and time received. Supporting documentation for submissions are included, such as plans, reports and bills. \nCabinet Minutes are held at Queensland State Archives",

    "description": "This data set is an index of the cancelled Bonne (imperial) series of public plans within Western Australia. i.e.: 20, 40, 80, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800 chain and 4, 8 mile scale ranges. The scale is <em>n chains/mile to one inch</em> and the plans are based on the Bonne Modified Conical Projection.\n\nBefore 1903, Public Plans of most of the areas covered by this series were drawn on sheets of the C, G, M, N and K collection of plans (see Record Series No. 979).\n\nFrom 1903, sheets of the 300 Chain cadastral series were used as bases for the Public Plans.\n\nAlready in 1910, some of the Public Plans on 300 Chain sheets were cancelled to, and continued on sheets of the 80 Chain series. In the 1970's, the 300 Chain series began to be retired in favour of sheets constructed on the Universal Mercator projection, with sheet lines conforming to the Australian Map Grid.\n\nThe sheets are hand coloured and annotated on lithographic bases (app. 68cm x 101cm), linen backed. Later plans are drawn on acetate sheets.\n\nThe plans in this series are held at the State Records Office at consignment 4567.",

    "title": "The collection of aerial photographs held by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre",
    "description": "Aerial photography has been an important means of acquiring spatial data in Antarctica and the subantarctic islands, though satellite imagery is playing an increasingly important role.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Data Centre's collection of aerial photographs includes (but is not limited to) the following.\n\n1 Vertical and oblique aerial photography of the Australian Antarctic Territory coastline and some inland areas, acquired by the US Navy during Operation Highjump in 1946/47.\n\n2 Vertical and oblique aerial photography flown by National Mapping (now part of Geoscience Australia) during 1954 - 1965 from fixed wing aircraft, mainly using a K17 trimetrigon camera. From 1960 the vertical camera in the system was replaced with a Wild RC9.  An Eagle V camera was also used in 1963. The photography was acquired along the Australian Antarctic Territory coastline  and over the Prince Charles Mountains.\n\n3 Comprehensive and systematic coverages of the Prince Charles Mountains and Enderby Land flown by National Mapping from a fixed wing aircraft in the 1970s using a Wild RC 9 camera.\n\n4 Photography acquired since 1977 from helicopters using non-metric Hasselblad and Linhof cameras. This photography was acquired principally for life science research and was not intended to be used for mapping. The photography was acquired over Heard Island, Macquarie Island, the Larsemann Hills, the Windmill Islands, the Vestfold Hills and Mawson Coast.\n\n5 Photography acquired since 1992/93 by the Australian Antarctic Division and AUSLIG (now part of Geoscience Australia) from helicopters using a Zeiss UMK camera. It has been used to acquire photography for large scale mapping of the Australian Antarctic Territory, Heard Island and Macquarie Island.\n\n6 Photography acquired since 2000 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a Wild RC8 camera. A revision of the guidelines for overflight heights over animal colonies required that animal census photography be done with a camera with a longer focal length than the Linhof camera previously used for this type of work.  This was in order to maintain the same scale at a greater height. The Wild RC8 camera has also been used for photography for mapping at the Windmill Islands.\n\n7 Photography of sea ice acquired since 2003 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a digital Nikon D1X digital camera.\n\n8 Photography of Adelie penguin colonies and other features acquired since 2009/10 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a digital Hasselblad H3D-II 50 digital camera.\n\nDigital flight lines and photo centres have been generated to represent the runs along which the photographs were taken and the centres of the photographs.  \n\n \n\nThe photos are scanned on a needs basis. Most of the Operation Highjump photos have been scanned but overall a minority of the photos have been scanned.  Preview images have been created of the scanned photos. The scanning of the Operation Highjump photos is described by a separate metadata record: 'Digital images of Operation Highjump aerial photography'.\n\nThe collection can be searched in two ways.\n\n1 A web search - see Aerial Photograph Catalogue link below.  Preview images of the scanned photos may be viewed using this search. In addition to the search, the Catalogue has tabs with information about viewing or obtaining photographs, the cameras used and further historical information.\n\n2  The flight line and photo centre data can be downloaded as shapefiles (refer to url below) and overlaid on topographic data in GIS software such as ArcGIS.  The Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) has mainly large to medium scale data topographic data available for download - refer to url below.\n\nThere are some flight lines for which photo centres have not yet been generated and some photo centres for which flight lines have not yet been generated.  This is being done gradually over time.  The flight line and photo centre shapefiles available for download will be updated about every six months.\n\nAlso available for download is a document with information about the cameras and a timeline for the photography - refer to url below.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2003 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

It may be harmful to human health and the environment.\nIt's important for anyone who wants to use groundwater in CYG areas to test it to make sure it's safe to use.\nEach CYG area has a status to help you understand how much groundwater investigation and clean-up has been done.\nEPA assigns a CYG area one of 3 statuses:\n    1. Post remediation – clean-up of groundwater has been done, but some groundwater contamination remains. All former groundwater quality restricted use zones (GQRUZs) have this status.\n    2. Under assessment – further monitoring, evaluation and/or remediation of the groundwater is expected.\n    3. Precinct – the source of groundwater contamination is not clear. There's evidence it comes from multiple sites. Clean-up of the groundwater cannot be effectively completed.\nWhen a particular area is not captured by a CYG area, it does not mean that the groundwater there is suitable for use. The groundwater may not have been tested. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the CYG area data published. EPA will not be held liable or responsible for any errors, or for any loss incurred from reliance on this data. For further information about a particular CYG area, refer to the accompanying assessment report (where available) or contact EPA.",

    "description": "This data was collected in September/October 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V05.\n\nDeparted: \tGeraldton, WA, Sept 21, 2011\nArrived:   \tFremantle, WA, Oct 17, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). 13-C values were recorded for 5 foraminiferal species through the core, with results varying considerably throughout the last 30kyr. The 13-C values of the benthic Cibicidoides spp. are the lowest, whilst those for the planktonic species are comparable, once correlated for their vital effects (except Globorotalia truncatulinoides because no correction for vital effects is available). It is apparent from the 13-C values that there are 3 main 13-C phases during the glacial/interglacial transition: Glacial, Deglaciation and Holocene phases.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

This has been calculated with the number of people who did not claim a GP attendance, divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as at 30 June 2016, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nUnique GP patients were identified through the Patient Identification Numbers (PINs) in the Medicare claim records.\n\n",

    "description": "A time series service that displays optical 8-bit spatial imagery over Queensland areas affected by historic natural disaster events captured from satellite, manned aircraft, or remotely piloted (drone) platforms. This service is designed to provide access to the state Remotely Sensed Image Library collection of publicly available natural disaster satellite imagery over Queensland. Natural disaster events include flood, bushfire, earthquake, tropical cyclone, storm, tornado, storm surge, landslide, tsunami, volcanic activity, meteorite strike, or other significant weather occurrences. The service is dynamic and can be used to filter and display individual imagery projects. The projects range from 5cm to 10m resolution. Accuracy is dependent on the individual projects. Periodical updates will be made to the service as new projects are released to the public domain. Projects are visible at scales 1:50,000, 1:250,000 and 1:500,000. If you would like to receive updates for new projects, functionality or planned downtime please subscribe here: http://ems.gs/3qln0iYbIYQ.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",
