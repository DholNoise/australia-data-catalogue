    "description": "The delineated wilderness coverage for the NSW Lower North East (LNE) region was developed from the National Wilderness Inventory (NWI) database - see separate metadata in \"NSW - CRA/RFA - Forests - Lower North East - National Wilderness Inventory (NWI) Database\". The dataset was derived using a set of decision rules developed by the Eden Wilderness Panel and refined by the Environment and Heritage Technical Committee.\n\nThe delineated wilderness dataset was used in negotiations for the North East NSW Regional Forest Agreement to fulfil nationally-agreed criteria (JANIS, 1997). The dataset was also used by the NSW Government in a subsequent process for assessment under the NSW Wilderness Act 1987 (EA, 1999).\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth Government and NSW Governments under the NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Data Agreement of 31 March 2000.This data is available to the public from the Department and may be used by third parties for unrestricted use provided that the copyright interests of the owners are protected.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and New South Wales Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "The Galactic Center (GC) is a key target for the radio component of Breakthrough Listen (BL) program. Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "    \n\nRelative Yield From Salinity in 2020 (%) dataset is one of 11 national\nsurfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic opportunities\nassociated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in 1996/97\nAustralian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a11.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nThis digital soil landscape product contains natural resource mapping for the Australian Capital Territory. The project was completed by the Office of Environment and Heritage (NSW). The project was funded by the ACT Government to enhance knowledge of soils, landscapes and physical constraints to land use in the urban and rural environment. The information will assist in informed decision making, planning and environmental modelling throughout the catchment.\n55 soil landscape map units have been described for the ACT. Each unit is an inventory of soil and landscape information with relatively uniform land management requirements, allowing major soil and landscape qualities and constraints to be identified.\nThe GIS product shown here provides location of each of the soil landscape map units - including the soil landscape code and name. For more detailed information please see the full soil landscape reports for each unit, as well as the final report (see datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au). Detailed spreadsheets can be used to join more detailed information to the GIS also available on request.\nLineage:\nThe mapping undertaken by the NSW Government was created using:<ul><li>\nexisting published soil landscape mapping (Canberra and Michelago 1:100,000 map sheets);</li><li>\nnew soil landscape mapping (part Brindabella and Tantangara 1:100,000 map sheets).</li></ul>\nFor all datasets, provisional soil landscapes were established firstly on the dominant geomorphic processes responsible for the formation of the landscape and secondly on the geological parent material. Elevation, aspect, vegetation patterns and human disturbance were other factors considered when defining units. \nFor existing mapping, the boundaries of these provisional soil landscapes were mapped using stereoscopic interpretation of 1:40,000 scale black and white and 1:25,000 scale colour aerial photographs (Canberra) and 1:40,000 scale black and white aerial photographs only for Michelago. LANDSAT thematic mapper and radiometric imagery were used to assist with perception and charting of provisional soil landscapes. These boundaries were transferred onto 1:25 000 topographic base maps. After field checking boundaries and detailed investigations of the soil, the provisional landscapes were confirmed, amalgamated or sub-divided.\nFor new mapping on the Brindabella and Tantangara sheets, the boundaries were captured by digitizing directly to screen at around 1:10,000 scale using ArcGIS. Ultra-high resolution (10 cm) aerial photographic imagery provided a base layer during the capture process. In addition the following data were used to assist delineate soil landscapes boundaries: ADS digital aerial imagery, radiometric imagery, SPOT 5 satellite imagery, climate data, 1 second DSM and DEM elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 1:100,000 scale geological mapping, 1:25,000 topographic maps and DTDB digital terrain models.\nSoils have been examined and described in detail at over 500 sites in the ACT. This includes 79 new detailed sites to fill data gaps for this project. At each site, soil morphological data and site information were recorded on Soil and Land Information System (SALIS) cards or digitally collected via the eDIRT field data collection system. Sufficient field work was undertaken within each soil landscape to identify the range of soils present and to enable their distribution within the landscape to be described. To best knowledge none of the sites were randomly sampled. Sample intervals were selected to be morphologically representative examples of each soil material present in each type profile i.e. soil horizons.\nA comprehensive suite of soil tests have been analysed for many of the representative type soil profiles within the ACT.\nA desktop review of published soil landscape units has occurred resulting in some minor amendments to the existing linework.\nPositional Accuracy:\nObservations and soil profiles were located using handheld GPS or using 1:25,000 topographic maps. Soil boundaries on this 1:100,000 scale map product is generally accurate to within 100 m on the ground but variations will occur especially where soil boundaries are gradual. The scale of use of this dataset is 1:100,000.\nAttribute Accuracy:\nSoil landscape map units are defined by unique combinations of soil type, topography, geology, native vegetation, land use, existing erosion/land degradation and constraints to development. The land and soil attributes in this product were mainly assessed using field observations, remote sensing interpretation (satellite, radiometric and aerial photos) and laboratory analysis of dominant soil type profiles.\nLogical Consistency:\nMap unit concepts and polygons, major soil types and soil landscape descriptions have been field verified by a peer soil scientist for many map units especially in published mapping areas and accessible terrain. All units have some level of field investigation and checking. ArcGIS was used to ensure all polygons in the shape file are topologically correct. All polygons have a unique identifier.\nCompleteness:\nAll polygons in the GIS layer are labeled with a soil landscape MasterCode and MasterName. PDF reports and spreadsheet data have been supplied for each map unit.\nAdditional Metadata:\nSoil Landscape of the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12</a>\nSoil Landscape of the Canberra 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf</a>\nSoil Landscapes of the Australian Capital Territory project report:\nCook, W., Jenkins, B., Young, M., Murphy, C., Milford H.B. and Muller, R.

Important information in the spatial feature class includes the dataset spatial extent (i.e. its \"footprint\") and dataset number and the state of origin of the underlying dataset. Where more than one dataset have been combined within a footprint, the polygons from each data source are represented separately (particularly in NSW and NT); however, \"veg clearing\" datasets have not been included directly, to keep the number of polygons manageable. See the real NVIS vector or raster data for such data.\n\nImportant information in the associated lookup table (NVIS5_1_LUT_KEY_DSETn, where n is an incremental number for minor updates) joined via DATA_SET_NUMBER includes data source (e.g. State and Territory NVIS or gap-fill), dataset name, publication scale and the on-ground range of dates of the vegetation survey.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 12 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.Restricted\nRestricted\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\nUsers must attribute the Department as the data provider.",

    "title": "Future scenarios for the southern Murray-Darling Basin water market",
    "description": "Since the peak of the Millennium drought, the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) has seen large increases in nut and cotton plantings, decreases in water supply due to environmental water recovery and tighter limits on water trade between regions. These changes have raised concerns about how the water market might cope under drought conditions. \r\n\r\n In this study, ABARES applies an economic model of the sMDB to simulate what would happen to the water market under a repeat of the Millennium drought, with current water demand, environmental water recovery, trade limits and carryover rules. These scenarios provide an indication of future water prices and trade patterns across the sMDB under a repeat of historical climate conditions (for the period 2002-03 to 2016-17). \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n• Modelling results suggest that under a repeat of historical conditions allocation water prices in the sMDB would rise no higher than the peaks observed during the previous drought. \r\n• Whilst demand for water has increased for cotton and almonds, this has been more than offset by reductions in demand in other industries particularly, grazing, dairy and rice. \r\n• Improvements in carryover rules will help to limit price rises under a repeat of the drought, with much larger volumes of water being stored between years. \r\n• Trade limits will likely be binding more often in the future, partly due to the changes in water demand. \r\n• While water price peaks are simulated to be no higher under a repeat of extreme drought conditions, they are higher on average, due in part to environmental water recovery. The modelling suggests a change in the distribution of prices, with fewer years of low prices.\r\n",

    "description": "The ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_R line features represent the set of river reaches that are assessed in the 2010 ISC. The line features represents the middle of the river channel and have been defined as the midpoint of the ISC2010_STREAMBED_WIDTH polygon feature.  This data set represents a re-alignment of the ISC2004 River Reaches. River centre lines have been connected at Reach ends and flow direction has been enforced. Each Reach has Metric Statistics assessed and recorded in Reach Summary (_R) Tabes. \n\nThe ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_R is designed to JOIN to all ISC2010__R tables.\n\nThe ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_REACH acts as the spatial key to which all other Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation reach metric statistics can be linked.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of general practitioner (GP) attendances and associated Medicare benefits expenditure per person. GP attendance has been calculated with the total services from eligible claims (excluding any bulk-billed incentive items or other top-up items), divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as at 30 June 2016. GP expenditure has been calculated with the total benefit paid for eligible claims, divided by the ERP as at 30 June 2016. The data spans the financial years of 2010-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nGP after-hours attendances are Medicare benefit-funded after-hours patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. They include urgent and non-urgent attendances.\n\n\nExpenditure on GP/specialist attendances comprises MBS funding for patient/doctor encounters. Expenditure is reported unadjusted for inflation.\n\n\nBulk-billing is an arrangement in which a medical practitioner sends the bill directly to Medicare, so the patient pays nothing. Also known as direct billing.\n\n\nAge-standardisation allows fairer comparisons to be made between areas by accounting for variation in the age of populations within each area. This adjustment is important because the rates of many health conditions and health service use vary with age.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\n<strong>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</strong>\nRiver and Creek Flooding\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside.&nbsp;\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i>&nbsp;Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions&nbsp;- with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage.&nbsp;\n<i>Purpose</i>:&nbsp;To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure&nbsp;with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach&nbsp;based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations.&nbsp;<i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i>&nbsp;\n<i>Flood Height:&nbsp;</i>Indicates the approximate water surface level of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event, expressed in metres above mean sea level. This dataset represents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of 0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i>&nbsp;The dataset includes three possible flood events of different probability.\n<i>Likelihood: Likely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood:&nbsp;Possible</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):&nbsp;1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):&nbsp;100 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood: Unlikely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year</i>\n<i>Version Notes&nbsp;3.1.0</i>&nbsp;- First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE.

Model does not include underground structures however rainfall was scaled down to account for the possibility of some run-off being contained within the underground system. A post-process was applied to eliminate areas of shallow depth, low velocity and low velocity depth product. Additional removal of model errors and small property intersects using spatial analysis and manual techniques.<i>Existing Conditions Scenario:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Modelled estimate of the extent of overland flow paths following a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability storm outside the river and creek flood extent and with some model errors and small property intersects removed.<i>Purpose:</i>&nbsp;To determine flood extent along overland flowpaths in areas outside the extent of the river and creek flood modelling. Suitable for public dissemination.<i>Flood Extent:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indicates the approximate extent of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event (not actual recorded levels). The inundation area may be less accurate where the property is flat near the outer limit of inundation, or where the ground surface has been modified since being surveyed.This dataset represents the flood extent as vector polygons without attribution.<i>Modelled Probability:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is:&nbsp;1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year<i>Likelihood:</i>&nbsp;Possible<i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):</i>&nbsp;1%<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):</i>&nbsp;100 YearA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but neverthess still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.<i>Version Notes&nbsp;1.25.0 - Sub set of F01 Version 1.24 with areas removed where field Public = N in F00N Version 1.18.8 (April 2025)</i><i>Version Resolution: 1.0m</i><i>Data Reliability: D</i><i>Indicates that Council can only provide an extent but not levels as the flood data is of limited reliability</i>\n<i><strong>Further Information</strong></i><i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website </i><a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">Flood information for residents of Moreton Bay - City of Moreton Bay</a>",

    "description": "This data set includes population and electronic gaming machine (EGM) expenditure breakdowns by local government area (LGA) and gaming venue, demographic statistics, labour statistics and Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) LGA score and ranking per LGA for the 2015/16 financial year. The data has been joined with LGA 2011 boundaries. \nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nEGM Numbers: a venue may be operating less machines than its licensed or attached numbers\n\n\nGaming Machine Density calculations are based on operating gaming machines with attached entitlements divided by adult population divided by 1,000 (gaming machines per 1,000 adults).\n\n\nExpenditure / EGM: Refers to the average Expenditure per Gaming Machine. In 2013, these figures are based on net expenditures divided by number of gaming machines with attached entitlements.\n\n\nSEIFA Scores: a lower score indicates that an area is relatively disadvantaged compared to an area with a higher score. Scores should only be used in distributive analysis. Rankings are based on highest score, for example 1st ranking in index of disadvantage means the LGA is least disadvantaged.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Care must be taken in using any figures for an LGA involving net expenditure and population. The expenditure per person in an LGA may include an amount of expenditure coming from persons not living within the LGA.\n\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis V7 database has been updated to include the Receptor data from Clarence-Moreton assessment team. The relevant tables of ReceptorList and tbl_Receptors and the spatial data of  GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt  were added to this version. The Clarence-Moreton Asset database v7 supersedes the previous version of the Asset database only in Receptor relevant tables/ feature class (i.e. ReceptorList, tbl_Receptors and GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt ).\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v7  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150916.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150916_GISOnly.gdb), the draft Receptor Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-140-ReceptorRegister-V20150916.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.

    "description": "The purpose of the experiment was to quantitatively examine the colour changes associated with moulting in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin between Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nCircular cages were constructed on the mud flat and characteristically marked crabs were introduced. In total 11 females and 10 males were photographed through at least one moult.\n\nOn average, U. capricornis grow 1.6mm with every moult. With every successive moult the carapace pattern contracts and becomes more distinct, especially in males. In addition to the considerable variation in pattern, both sexes also vary in the specific colour of their spots. Colour changes are associated with moulting and, as with pattern, tend to follow a certain progression.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis data set comprises the  inputs, parameters and outputs of the OGIA groundwater models as used for BA groundwater modelling reported in the product 2.6.2 of Maranoa-Balonne-Condamine subregion. Only one input file (MODFLOW drain package input file) was modified for the BA specific model runs. This input file is provided within the folder named NIC_MBC_Model_Input_files. All other model inputs are the same as is used in the OGIA model runs for Underground water Impact Report 2012. These inputs may be requested from Office of Groundwater Impact Assessment and is not published in the BA repository as per the agreement with OGIA.\n\nThe OGIA drain package has been modified to include the boundary conditions caused by 7 mines in the MBC subregion. For this  a python script was written. The script reads the original drain package file (ASCII file) of OGIA model and then write additional drain cells to the file at the locations of the 7 mines - Commodore, newAcland stage 2, Wilkie Creek, Kogan Creek, Cameby Downs, New Acland stage 3 and The Range. The script reads the locations of these mines from input files - .dat  (to the script) with names similar to the mine names. The locations of the mines are specified as rows and columns of the model grid in these input files. These files also have the elevations of the drain cells (bottom/centre of the cells in the Walloon Coal Measures in which the coal mine pit is present). The location and elevation data were obtained from OGIA  and is registered as a separate data set. \n\nTwo copies of the  python script are present in the folder corresponding to the baseline and CRDP drain packages.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nAll the model input data files were obtained from OGIA with the condition that these will not be published. The drain package input file and all output files were generated by CSIRO Land and Water by using CSIRO generated scripts and by running the model using these inputs. The drain package has inputs from the original OGIA model drain pakcage and additional data obtained from OGIA and coal mine footprint data. \n\n\n\nThe coal mine footprint data sets is registered as a separate data set. The OGIA model is not registered as a separate source data set as it is not publishable as per the agreement.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) MBC Groundwater model.

    "description": "####_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._####\r\n\r\n### Background ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information. \r\n\r\n### 2020 AIS data ###\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2020 AIS information lodged by multiple charities. \r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2020 AIS data. This report - the 8th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on [our website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/tools/reports/australian-charities-report-8th-edition).\r\n\r\n### Interpreting AIS data ###\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au).\r\n\r\n### Withheld information ###\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n### More ACNC data ###\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. \r\n",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and covers the northern part of the suburb of Chester\nHill. It is an urban catchment that drains through a stormwater pipe network in a north-easterly\ndirection to the Parramatta Council Local Government Area (LGA). The Wolumba catchment is one\nof the sub catchments of Duck River, and is wholly within the north western section of Bankstown City\nCouncil (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 160 stormwater pits and 220 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Wolumba Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix B.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix B.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the current Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of national land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for application to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature conservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved tenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series. Further information can be found on the Forests Australia website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. This pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 5. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors as well as a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nFreshwater basil aquifer data indicates the approximate boundary of the fresh water basal aquifer on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behaviour on the island.\nThe boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to a generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the freshwater basal aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection.   In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift. \nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Australian National Mooring Network Facility is a series of national reference stations and regional moorings designed to monitor particular oceanographic phenomena in Australian coastal ocean waters. \n\nThere are seven sub-facilities in the ANMN: four regional sub-facilities, a series of National Reference Stations (NRS), Acoustic Observatories and an Acidification Moorings sub-facility.\n\nThe ANMN sub-facilities are:\na) Queensland and Northern Australia\nb) New South Wales\nc) Southern Australia\nd) Western Australia\ne) Acoustic Observatories \nf) National Reference Stations (Coordination and Analysis)\ng) Acidification Moorings\n\nThe National Reference Stations were first established in the 1940’s and are the backbone component of the observing system.  Extended by IMOS from three to nine sites around the entire Australian continent, the stations report integrated biological, chemical and physical oceanography time series observations, upon which more intensive local and regional scale studies can be referenced against. The regional moorings monitor the interaction between boundary currents and shelf water masses and their consequent impact upon ocean productivity (e.g. Perth Canyon Upwelling; Kangaroo Island Upwelling) and ecosystem distribution and resilience (e.g. Coral Sea interaction with the Great Barrier Reef ). Operation of the network is distributed between several operators and coordinated nationally.\n\nPassive acoustic listening station arrays are located at three sites. These stations provide baseline data on ambient oceanic noise, detection of fish and mammal vocalizations and detection of underwater events. The Acidification Moorings are co-located at three of the National Reference Stations, and provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.",

    "description": "The Yongala acidification mooring is co-located with the Yongala National Reference Station (NRSYON) in Queensland. It was first deployed in 2011, but subsequently damaged by Tropical Cyclone Yasi in February 2011. It was replaced in September 2013.\n\nThe mooring's instruments measure surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. Current instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and a WETLabs WQM.\n\nThe Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification. The Yongala acidification moorings is located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean.",

The data spans the years 2013-2015 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC) and historical data for time trends. Where the term 'teenage mother' is used the analysis is based on women who gave birth aged under 20. Teenage mothers and their babies are more likely to experience broader disadvantage, have antenatal risk factors and have poorer maternal and baby outcomes during and after birth, than older mothers and their babies. \nThe Teenage Mothers in Australia data accompanies the Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nExcludes women not usually resident in Australia or whose usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "MeerKAT has already discovered a number of Galactic transients, which are most likely to be Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs). Previous observations of a few of these sources with the Parkes UWL receiver have proven its utility in follow-up timing observations of MeerKAT discoveries.\n  MeerKAT has discovered a few more RRATs in its latest observing cycle and more good quality UWL observations of these sources are required to determine the rotational period and period derivative and also to facilitate the study of their emission properties. Therefore, we request follow-up observations of 5 new sources to achieve this and to further enable spectral and polarization studies of these sources. Given the potential link between RRATs, magnetars, and some fast radio bursts (FRBs) suggested by both observations and theories, this study could reveal more similarities between these different classes of transient sources and significantly advance our understanding of their origins.",

These groundwater areas are\nfurther subdivided into groundwater subareas. The subareas are not proclaimed under the Rights in Water\nand Irrigation Act, but are administrative boundaries used to manage the extraction and licensing of \ngroundwater resources.\n\nGroundwater Resources in this dataset are not always the intersection of a Subarea with an Aquifer. \nAdditionally, the Groundwater Areas stored in WRIMS do not accurately reflect the official gazetted \nGroundwater Area boundaries. A program is currently underway (Sept 2005) to review both Groundwater \nResource and Groundwater area boundaries. Please contact the data steward for more information.",

It is important to note that Queensland Police Service offender statistics are based on offence counts and do not and cannot refer to individuals. Rather, offender data refers to the number of offences cleared or solved through an action against an offender. As such, offender data does not equate to a unique offender count nor does it equate to the number of offences cleared. Only persons ten years and over deemed to be offenders, Juvenile offenders are those aged between and including ten and sixteen years.

This \"tow-yo\" dataset differs from standard (fixed station) CTD data in that the data are collected from a constantly varying range of depths as the system is towed by the research vessel moving at a specified speed. The voyage took place during April and May 2000. The voyage track leading from Cairns across the Coral Sea to Jomard Entrance, then across the Solomon Sea to St Georges Channel,eastern Manus Basin,and the Bismarck Sea, finishing in Rabul.

    "description": "A series of 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 8. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

The data spans the months of 2001 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

The hillshade was created in ArcMap using the 'hillshade' tool with an azmith of 315, an altitude of 45 and a vertical exaggeration of 5. The hillshade covers the full extent of Christmas Island. The hillshade image can be viewed as a greyscale image, or underneath the DEM (if semi-transparent). It can also be viewed under any other layer to show the lie of the land, for example orthophotography, canopy heights or infrastructure.\nThe hillshade was created from the 2011 DEM which is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Resident Population (ERP) by number of households and number of dwellings for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2011 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for LGAs and Victoria in Future Small Areas (VIFSA) for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n This study examined the features of Australian wild dog management groups, particularly in terms of landholder participation and collaboration, to identify what helps or hinders the groups in achieving coordinated and effective wild dog management. The study was based on interviews with representatives from 30 groups across Australia. \r\n\r\n This work was undertaken as part of a broader ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n\r\n The study found that as well as reduced losses from wild dog attacks, the operations of many groups have resulted in more strategic and targeted control actions and better communication between neighbours. Wild dog management groups function as important social networks that help farming communities cope with the detrimental effects of wild dogs. The report makes suggestions about the support that groups may need in future to achieve wild dog management. \r\n\r\n The study findings have been used in the design of a national landholder survey on wild dog management, which ABARES conducted in late 2014.

    "description": "This data was collected in May 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS042010.\n\nDeparted: \tPort Hedland, Australia, May 8, 2010\nArrived:  \tFremantle, Australia, May 27, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2011 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "Sites where earth resources have been demonstrated. This includes metallics, industrial minerals and construction materials, but excludes  oil, gas and groundwater resources which are recorded in OILGAS and BORES datasets. OILGAS will be available for external users within Petroleum Mapshare. It is thought that groundwater resources will be available to external users within a CLPR (Catchment and Land Protection) Mapshare View. \n\nThe data is derived from Minerals and Petroleums RDBMS, which is known as VICMINE.\nInformation on each site has been compiled mostly from historical literature, with only selected major sites visited in the field.\n\nNOTES CONCERNING GEOVIC \"Mines and Mineral Occurrence\" DISPLAY\n\nThe type of mine/mineral occurrence displayed varies with the scale of the map view.\nMajor and Intermediate  size mines are displayed at all scales.\nMinor and Unknown size  Mines are displayed at scales ranging from 1:1 to 1:500,000\nMAJOR is for mine_size greater than= 85000000\nMINOR is for mine_size less than 8500000\nINTERMEDIATE is for mine_size between the two\nUNKNOWN is when the mine_size is unknown\n\nMINE_SIZE (better name would be MINE_VALUE) is a calculated dollar amount based on the total production and resource for each commodity multiplied by the commodity price (NOTE: these commodity prices have not been updated in some time eg: as of 13/1/2013 the gold price per ounce used was $526.70 - April 1985 prices) \n\nNOTES CONCERNING GEOVIC \"Deposit Styles\" DISPLAY\n\nA number of deposit style layers exist in GeoVic.\nThe layers are based on particular values of the dep_style attribute - within this dataset.\nThe dep_style attribute contains the results of classifying the mineral deposits of Victoria east of approximately 142°30' and west of 145°30', but excluding the Willaura (7422) 1:100 000 map sheet area.  The classification is described in detail in Moore, D.H., 2007. \"Classifying gold deposits in central and western Victoria, Australia. GeoScience Victoria Gold Undercover Report\".  \n\nGENERAL NOTES CONCERNING GEOVIC\n\nRefer to Mineral Regions 1M (MINERAL) for extent of brown and black coal fields, Heavy Mineral Sands 1M (MINSAND1M) for extent of strandline mineral sand deposits, and Heavy Minerals Sands WIM 1M (MINSAND1M) for extent of WIM style mineral sand deposits.",

    "description": "The overall aims were to provide data on the distribution of deep seabed habitats and fauna that are amenable to scientific hypothesis testing, can be immediately applied to marine resource management processes, and that enable strategic development of tools and techniques for understanding the processes that maintain deep sea biodiversity. This work was to support the process of NWR Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories, distribution maps and conservation values. Data will be collected at scientific reference sites from potential MPA areas that can be re-visited for monitoring purposes in the future. Sampling along environmental gradients (geographic range and depth) in this section of Australia's coast will also provide the opportunity to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses. Further refinement of predictive methods for identifying seabed habitat types, initially developed in temperate and cool-temperate environments, will be enabled by data collection from this tropical location in Australia. We intended to highlight the importance of this underlying science as a modern 'Voyage of Discovery' given the likely significance of the findings in terms of Australia's biodiversity and its biogeography and evolution. (From Voyage Plan)\n\nThis record describes the video and still imagery collected with the CSIRO deep-towed camera system. Imagery has not been systematically annotated or scored.  The associated videos and still images have been archived as described in MarLIN record 14436 'Benthic Habitats Video Image Archive'",

The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nContains the files and R scripts used for creating interpolated surfaces of depth to groundwater and contour maps of piezometric surfaces for dry (200 - 2007) and wet (2008 - 2012) periods in the Bremer, Clarence Lockyer, Logan-Albert and Richmond alluvial systems.  Piezometric surfaces and depth to groundwater surfaces are created using ordinary kriging in R.  The data used come from the bores in the QLD and NSW groundwater databases (see data lineage).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGroundwater hydraulic head data from the NSW and QLD databases (see data lineage) was extracted by selecting only those data collected between 2000 and 2012 and that fell within the boundary shapefiles for the alluvial bodies.  Elevation data from the DEM was appended to the spatial locations for each groundwater bore in the dataset.  Ordinary kriging was then performed in R to create interpolated surfaces for depth to groundwater and piezometric surfaces.  The kriging makes use of the digital elevation model as a covariate for aiding prediction.  The R scripts output pdf maps of the surfaces for each of the following alluvial systems: Bremer, Clarence, Lockyer, Logan-Albert and Richmond.  Maps are produced for for the dry period (2000 - 2007) and wet period (2008 - 2012) and show the predicted surface in addition to the prediction standard deviation.\n\n\n\nThe R script also outputs the rasters used to create these maps to .asc files (ascii grids).  There are four such ascii grids for the entire alluvium: \n\n1. PiezometricSurface_Dry.asc  (the estimated piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the dry years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n2. PiezometricSurface_SD_Dry.asc (the estimated standard deviation of the piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the dry years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n3. PiezometricSurface_Wet.asc (the estimated piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the wet years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n4. PiezometricSurface_SD_Wet.asc (the estimated standard deviation of the piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the wet years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) CLM - Interpolated piezometric surfaces for Alluvium.

Using the 20cm multibeam and a new digital filterbank array this survey will create a petabyte digital record of the sky that can be data mined in the future and used to search for relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars, RRATs, and extragalactic radio bursts. The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

    "title": "DSS - Quarterly Payment Recipients (LGA) December 2019",
    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Tenure of Australia's forests (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\nTenure of Australia's forests (2013) v2.0 is a continental dataset of tenure classified into national forest tenure classes:  Multiple Use Public Forest, Nature Conservation Reserves, Other Crown Land, Leasehold, Private Freehold and Unresolved Tenure.  The dataset combines forest cover with land tenure information. \r\n\r\n The forest cover information was sourced from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0  dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset, reclassified in order to align the national forest types and national forest categories of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) forest cover dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013). \r\n\r\n The land tenure information was sourced from the commercially available Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) CADLite and Tenure datasets, and tenure data obtained from the former Forests NSW (now Forestry Corporation of NSW). The NFI - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments, whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests - used information from these sources to compile a national tenure dataset by applying a national classification to the data supplied by the states and territories to allow seamless integration. \r\n\r\n As with previous versions, this Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 dataset was produced by combining the NFI land tenure dataset with the most recent Forests of Australia dataset. The only difference between the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) and the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 is that the latter has the updated national forest cover types and new national forest categories. The underlying land tenure data is the same in both versions of the 2013 forest tenure datasets. \r\n",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n In this edition of the Australian crop report, ABARES will release its latest forecast of summer crop production in 2016-17 and its latest estimate of winter crop production in 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Planting of 2016-17 summer crops is largely completed and planted area is estimated to have increased from last year because of above average spring rainfall. However, yields of dryland summer crops are expected to be constrained by hot and dry seasonal conditions during summer. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology's latest three-month rainfall outlook suggests above average rainfall is unlikely across the major summer cropping regions in Queensland and northern New South Wales. \r\n• Harvesting of 2016-17 winter crops is now largely complete and production is estimated to have exceeded the forecast of record production presented in the December 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n",

    "description": "In September and October of 2011 Geoscience Australia surveyed part of the offshore northern Perth Basin in order to map potential sites of natural hydrocarbon seepage. The primary objectives of the survey were to map the spatial distribution of seepage sites and characterise the nature of the seepage at these sites (gas vs oil, macroseepage vs microseepage; palaeo vs modern day seepage) on the basis of: acoustic signatures in the water column, shallow subsurface and on the seabed; geochemical signatures in rock and sediment samples and the water column; and biological signatures on the seabed. Areas of potential natural hydrocarbon seepage that were surveyed included proven (drilled) oil and gas accumulations, a breached structure, undrilled hydrocarbon prospects, and areas with potential signatures of fluid seepage identified in seismic, satellite remote sensing and multibeam bathymetry data. Within each of these areas the survey acquired: water column measurements with the CTD; acoustic data with single- and multi-beam echosounders, sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler (sidescan not acquired in Area F as it was too deep in places); and sediment and biological samples with the Smith-McIntyre Grab. In addition, data were collected with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), integrated hydrocarbon sensor array, and CO2 sensor in selected areas. Sampling with the gravity corer had limited success in many of the more shallow areas (A-E) due to the coarse sandy nature of the seabed sediments. This dataset comprises mineraology of the upper 2cm of seabed sediment. The mineral assemblage includes quartz, aragonite, calcite and high-Mg calcite expressed as mol %.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",
