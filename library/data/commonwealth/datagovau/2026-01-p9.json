    "title": "Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update March 2014",
    "description": "## This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at March 2014. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (1997 to 2012) and scale of mapping (1:25 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 7, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. ",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nSurface expression GDEs are ecosystems that are dependent on the discharge of groundwater on a permanent or intermittent basis to meet all or some of their water requirements so as to maintain their communities of plants and animals, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Surface expression GDE areafeatures include wetlands and regional ecosystems that have some surface groundwater dependency. This dataset is one of five datasets that describe the distribution of known and potential GDEs across the landscape. The complete set of GDE datasets is listed below. Information about the location and extent of known and potential GDEs was sourced from expert knowledge, literature and existing datasets. 1. Surface expression GDE points 2. Surface expression GDE lines 3. Surface expression GDE areas 4. Terrestrial GDE areas 5. Subterranean GDE areas As the different types of GDEs represent different overlapping layers or cross-sections of the landscape, it is recommended that the datasets be mapped in the order of listing shown above (i.e. surface expression GDE points on top) to maintain logical consistency and assist visualisation.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThere are five datasets that describe the distribution of known and potential GDEs across the landscape: 1. Surface expression GDE points, 2. Surface expression GDE lines, 3. Surface expression GDE areas, 4. Terrestrial GDE areas, 5. Subterranean GDE areas.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nLinework to delineate the GDE extent was sourced from the following datasets (held by the Queensland Herbarium, Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts): 1. Queensland Wetland Data Wetlands Mapping (2009 extent, Version 3.0) 2. Vegetation Communities and Regional Ecosystems (REs) of Queensland (2009 extent, Version 7.0) Although the wetlands linework was typically used to represent surface expression GDEs and regional ecosystems linework typically used to represent terrestrial GDEs, this was not always the case. A notable exception is the inclusion of riverine regional ecosystems as potential terrestrial GDEs. Non-wetland regional ecosystems have been used to delineate areas that may potentially contain surface expression GDEs such as geological contact zones where springs may be not detected as a wetland in current wetlands mapping due to their small size. ATTRIBUTION The attribution for this dataset was sourced from expert knowledge, literature and existing spatial datasets. Information about the location and extent of groundwater was collected at GDE workshops held for the eastern Murray-Darling Basin and Wide Bay and Burnett mapping areas. Information collected from regional staff and other experts with local knowledge of groundwater included the location of wetlands, springs and stream baseflow. Known and potential GDEs were identified in the GDE workshops and this is attributed in the data with the level of confidence (i.e. high, moderate or low) in the knowledge about the GDE. The degree of groundwater dependency is not described. An important part of the information collection at the GDE workshops included the capture of pictorial conceptual models which are representations of observed objects, phenomena and processes in a logical and objective way with the aim of constructing a formal system whose theoretical consequences are not contrary to what is observed in the real world. These pictorial conceptual models will be hyperlinked to the GDE spatial data to aid the interpretation of the data. For more information refer to the GDE pictorial conceptual models. Another key part of the information collected was the identification of GDE decision rules that described combinations of conditions where ecosystems are or are likely to be dependent on groundwater at a specific site or local area according to expert knowledge. GDE decision rules may include descriptions of conditions such as geology, vegetation, topographic position, elevation and rainfall zones. These decision rules were subsequently categorised and combined into GDE mapping rule-sets in preparation for their application using geographic information system (GIS) technology. GDE mapping rule-set is a combination of related decision rules with similar groundwater dependent ecosystem drivers and processes that when applied to spatial data sets through GIS analysis delineate where ecosystems are or are likely to be dependent on groundwater. These GDE mapping rule-sets are used to determine the 'derived' potential GDEs that make up the majority of the GDE mapping. A full list of GDE mapping rule-sets developed for the eastern MDB and WBB regions is described below. Note that where the GDE mapping rule-sets are used, this may result in the identification of surface expression GDEs and/or terrestrial GDEs according to the local conditions and landscape drivers.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\n\"Queensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts\" (2013) Queensland groundwater dependent ecosystems.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2000 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a01.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

Serial Number - YC030136\nFocal Length - 69.8261mm\nImagery Type - RGB\nAcquisition Date(s) - 2018-08-17, 2018-08-18\nFlying Height (above MSL) - Approx 5000ft MSL for 10cm resolution, but variable due to terrain\nCapture Methodology - North-South runs: 88, Tie/coastal strips: 7\nForward / Side Overlap (%) - 70 / 40\n\n<b>Orthosmosaic</b>\n\nA digital orthophoto is a raster image of remotely sensed data in which displacement in the image due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been corrected (orthorectification). Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - &lt;3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)\nRectification Surface Accuracy Vertical - +/- 0.30m @ 95 % CI for client supplied LIDAR DTM, as per client metadata for dataset (not independently verified)\nRectification Surface Accuracy Horizontal - +/- 0.8m @ 95 % CI, as per client metadata for dataset\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "The purpose of this experiment was to quantitatively examine the rapid colour changes associated with the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 and 05/06). \n\n65 randomly selected crabs were caught (21 males and 44 females) and their ability to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer. \n\nThe results indicate that when caught, or otherwise stressed, U. capricornis are capable of rapidly changing their colour, with short term colour changes more likely in females. In all cases the pattern remained unchanged, but did become more difficult to distinguish as the colours darkened.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The beef sectors of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have grown significantly over the past two decades. This report profiles the beef industries of these four beef exporting South American nations, as well as Australia, and evaluates the trends and key factors behind the growth in real export values since 2000. Forward looking scenario analysis based on actual and hypothetical changes to policies and operating environments is undertaken to assess the potential impacts on Australia's future beef exports. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n\r\n Global demand for beef is expected to expand significantly over the next several decades, especially in Asia, which will present opportunities for exporters. \r\n\r\n Australia and South America, together, account for almost half of world trade in beef. \r\n\r\n South America is emerging as a significant competitor for the Australian beef industry, as market access to Australia's traditional markets is improving. \r\n\r\n For the five beef exporting countries profiled in this report, improved market access was the main driver of real export revenue growth (in 2000 US dollar terms) between 2000 and 2014. Other contributing drivers include changes in export supply costs, exchange rate movements and growth in demand for beef. \r\n\r\n Three forward-looking scenarios assess the potential change to export growth from 2014 to 2030 from changes in domestic and international operating environments. These include: the removal of Argentine agricultural export requirements; improved market access for South American beef; and improvements in transport infrastructure for Brazil and Australia. \r\n\r\n To maintain its export competitiveness, Australia will need to: 1. improve productivity growth both on and off the farm \r\n2. continue to target premium markets and improve market access in order to be responsive to changes in the market \r\n3. maintain a production system that ensures its status as a clean and green beef producer so that it will be able to distinguish itself on quality when it cannot compete on price with lower-cost exporters. \r\n",

    "title": "Groundwater use of riparian vegetation along Cooper Creek",
    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. This investigation sought to investigate the water balance of the alluvium of the Cooper Creek using the actual evapotranspiration from MODIS-Landsat blended CMRSET. Previous research has shown that the river red gum and coolibah trees in the riparian zone are using both soil moisture and groundwater, whereas the rest of the floodplain vegetation is limited to using soil moisture fed from rainfall and overbank flooding. This allows us to classify areas based on their actual evapotranspiration and therefore water sources: open water > riparian areas > floodplain > rain fed areas. Transmission losses are very high in Cooper Creek with 81% of the water flowing into the system from the Barcoo and Thompson rivers lost by the time it reaches the Qld/SA border. This water is either lost to the floodplain through overbank flooding or to groundwater recharge. There is no regional freshwater resource and the freshwater lenses around waterholes are consumed by the riparian vegetation within hundreds of metres of the waterholes. Using the remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration data enables vegetation water use to be split by water source. For the period 2000-2018, 77% of water lost from Cooper Creek was lost to the floodplain where it supports the pasture growth critical to the pastoral industry. The remaining 23% was lost to evapotranspiration by the riparian vegetation or as open water evaporation in waterholes. The waterholes act as recharge features of the landscape while Cooper Creek is in flood, through scouring of the bed of the channels, and then self-seal when the velocity of the flow decreases. When sealed, there is no leakage to groundwater. Local-scale recharge can be inferred for each waterhole using a groundwater balance based on transpiration of groundwater from the riparian zone vegetation. Of the 80 waterholes that hold water more than 95% of the time, the calculated recharge rate was between 130 and 970 mm/year over the area of the waterhole. These recharge estimates suggest recharge occurs through the bed of the channels, as well as from the waterholes, the area-weighted average recharge rate for these 80 waterholes was 260 mm/year. \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe Lineage field lists the parents of this dataset. The steps involved in creating this dataset were: (1) classify annual evapotranspiration dataset into four classes based on the magnitude of the AET - Open water > riparian vegetation > floodplain vegetation > dryland areas; (2) calculate the mode of the classified landscape class from the 18 years of data (classed_AET_TS_ann_mode_clipped_FP.tif); (3) calculate the number of times a pixel was classified as riparian vegetation (sumrip.tif); (4) calculate a water balance at the landscape scale (WB at landscape scale.xls); and (5) calculate a water balance at the scale of a waterhole (WB at waterhole scale.xls). More information on how this dataset was created can be found in the journal paper: \r\nCrosbie RS, Holland KL and McVicar TR (in prep) Actual evapotranspiration in the Cooper Creek floodplain: transmission losses and groundwater recharge.

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nAustralia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) is a continental dataset which identifies forested and non-forested land over which Indigenous Australians have legislated use and rights. The Indigenous use and rights information was sourced from multiple Indigenous land ownership, land management and land rights datasets from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies. The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset. The dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR). The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are:\r\n1.\tIndigenous owned and managed;\r\n2.\tIndigenous managed;\r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and\r\n4.\tOther Special rights.\r\nThese categories align with the reporting requirements of the SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a N-S transect, running from Red Point in the north, to Creswell in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 9 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The three means for managing bushfire fuels are\nreduction, removal and conversion to a less flammable type, and are achieved by\nundertaking the slashing, grazing, physical removal, and/or prescribed burns\n\n\nThese activities are described in a yearly program of work\nreferred to as the <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/bushfire-management-plans\">Bushfire Operations Plan</a> (BOP), which sets out activities to meet the\nrequirements of the <a href=\"https://esa.act.gov.au/community-information/publications/sbmp/\">Strategic\nBushfire Management Plan for the ACT</a> (SBMP).

    "title": "Agricultural commodities: December quarter 2015",
    "description": "Overview \r\n The December edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities in 2015-16, and updates the outlook ABARES released in September 2015. \r\n\r\n In addition to commodity forecasts, this publication includes two boxes: \r\n• seasonal conditions in Australia \r\n• farm cash income of broadacre farms \r\n and one article: • key agricultural outcomes of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. \r\n\r\nFarmer/stakeholder implications \r\n The Agricultural commodities report provides high quality and timely information that supports higher farm gate returns through informed decision making by primary producers. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8 per cent in 2015-16 to around $57.6 billion, following an estimated increase of 4 per cent to $53.5 billion in 2014-15. At this forecast level, the gross value of farm production in 2015-16 would be around 17 per cent higher than the average of $49.4 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 13 per cent in 2015-16 to $30.0 billion following an estimated increase of 16 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects expected increases in the farmgate prices for beef cattle, lamb, sheep and wool. \r\n• The forecast increases in farmgate prices are expected to more than offset a forecast decline of 5 per cent in the volume index of livestock production in 2015-16. This mainly reflects an assumption of more favourable seasonal conditions in the latter half of 2015-16 leading to reduced slaughter as a result of herd and flock rebuilding. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 2 per cent in 2015-16 to $27.6 billion alongside an expected increase of 2 per cent in the volume index of crop production. This mainly reflects increases in horticultural production offsetting the falling world prices of grains and oilseeds. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $44.0 billion in 2015-16, following a rise of 6 per cent to an estimated $43.6 billion in 2014-15. At this level, export earnings from farm commodities in 2015-16 would be around 15 per cent higher than the average of $38.2 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• Agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2015-16 include: wheat (up 3 per cent to $5.7 billion), wool (9 per cent to $3.5 billion), wine (3 per cent to $2.1 billion), lamb (1 per cent to $1.7 billion), sugar (8 per cent to $1.4 billion), live feeder/slaughter cattle (16 per cent to $1.3 billion) and chickpeas (56 per cent to $0.6 billion). \r\n• These forecast increases are expected to be largely offset by forecast falls in export earnings from beef and veal (down 3 per cent to $8.6 billion), dairy (6 per cent to $2.3 billion), coarse grains (14 per cent to $2.3 billion), canola (8 per cent to $1.2 billion), cotton (21 per cent to $1.2 billion) and mutton (2 per cent to $0.8 billion). \r\n• Export earnings from fisheries products are forecast to increase by 17 per cent to around $1.7 billion in 2015-16, after increasing by an estimated 10 per cent to $1.4 billion in 2014-15. \r\n• The index of unit export returns for Australian farm exports is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2015-16, following an estimated rise of 6 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects the effect of the assumed lower value of the Australian dollar, especially against the US dollar. \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of beef and veal, wool, wine, lamb, live feeder/slaughter cattle, rock lobster, mutton and chickpeas are forecast to increase in 2015-16. In contrast, export prices of wheat, barley, sugar and dairy products are forecast to decline. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n• World economic growth is assumed to be 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.4 per cent in 2016. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2015-16, compared with 2.2 per cent in 2014-15. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average around US72 cents in 2015-16, 14 per cent lower than the average of US84 cents in 2014-15. \r\n",

    "description": "<b>Imagery Capture</b>\n\nSensor - VisionMap A3-Edge\nFocal Length - 300mm (f/4.5)\nImagery Type - RGB\nAcquisition Date(s) - 2017-05-15, 2017-05-16\nFlying Height (above MSL) - 2440m (8000ft)\nCapture Methodology - Primary Runs - 17, Secondary/Tie Runs - 0\nForward / Side Overlap (%) - 55 / 60\n\n<b>Orthosmosaic</b>\n\nA digital orthophoto is a raster image of remotely sensed data in which displacement in the image due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been corrected (orthorectification). Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - +/- 3pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - DTM (supplied by DNRM in .img format)\nDescription of rectification - High end commercial photogrammetric software and Aerometrex proprietary software has been utilised in the ortho rectification and mosaicing process. This methodology assists Aerometrex to produce a seamless geo-referenced orthophotography product.\nTile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km GeoTIFF Tiles\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\n\n\nThis is Version 1 of the Australian Soil Clay product of the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia.\n\n          \n\nThe Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia has produced a range of digital soil attribute products. Each product  contains six digital soil attribute maps, and their upper and lower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths: 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm. These depths are consistent with the specifications of the GlobalSoilMap.net project (http://www.globalsoilmap.net/). The digital soil attribute maps are in raster format at a resolution of 3 arc sec (approximately 90 x 90 m pixels).\n\n          \n\nThese maps are generated by combining the best available Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) products available across Australia.\n\n          \n\nAttribute Definition: 2 micrometre mass fraction of the less than 2 mm soil material determined using the pipette method;\n\nUnits: %;\n\nPeriod (temporal coverage; approximately): 1950-2013;\n\nSpatial resolution: 3 arc seconds (approx 90m);\n\nTotal number of gridded maps for this attribute: 18;\n\nNumber of pixels with coverage per layer: 2007M (49200 x 40800);\n\nTotal size before compression: about 8GB;\n\nTotal size after compression: about 4GB;\n\nData license : Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC By);\n\nTarget data standard: GlobalSoilMap specifications;\n\nFormat: GeoTIFF.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe National Digital Soil Property Maps are generated by combining the best available digital soil mapping to calculate a variance weighted mean for each pixel. Two DSM methods have been utilised across and in various parts of Australia, these being:\n\n              \n\n              1) Decision trees with piecewise linear models with kriging of residuals developed from soil site data \n\n              across Australia. (Viscarra Rossel et al., 2014a);\n\n              2) Disaggregation of existing polygon soil mapping using DSMART (Odgers et al. 2014a).\n\n              \n\n              Version 1 of the National Digital Soil Property Maps combines mapping from the:\n\n              \n\n              1) Australia-wide three-dimensional Digital Soil Property Maps;\n\n              2) Western Australia Polygon Disaggregation Maps;\n\n              3) South Australian Agricultural Areas Polygon Disaggregation Maps;\n\n              4) Tasmanian State-wide DSM Maps.\n\n              \n\n              These individual mapping products are also available in the CSIRO Data Access Portal \n\n              (https://data.csiro.au).

    "description": "\n\n\nThis dataset shows the modelled regional connectivity links for generalist species (birds and small mammals). Based local corridor values based on least cost paths through a local links dataset (see Barrett and Love 2012) at 2012. Categories indicate quality of regional connectivity between larger high value habitat patches. \nDataset has been re-categorised from  the original raster data source to eliminate \"no value\" cells and converted to a vector.\nRegional Linkage Value: This layer is derived from a two-step process. The first process is a “join the dots” links analysis using 550,000 paths between point pairs selected at random. Points were grouped in high value woodland habitat patches only. This least cost pathway analysis was then run through the local links paths, that is regional links were preferentially routed along paths that did not have a canopy gap of &gt;100m. High values indicate that more paths were found, i.e. more important for regional connectivity between high value habitat patches.\nconnectivityLinkageValue:\nRepresents the categorisation of the \"accumulated least cost pathway\" value for each linkage between habitat patches.  Least cost pathway indicates the a combination of habitat suitability of nodes along the path, and a the barriers to migration along that pathway.\nThe ACT connectivity mapping was undertaken by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A full study report has been produced, and is entitled Fine Scale Modelling of Fauna Habitat and Connectivity Values in the ACT Region. This study built upon an earlier report entitled the Ecological Connectivity for Climate Change in the ACT and surrounding region, commissioned by the ACT Government as part of Weathering the Change Action Plan 1. The report was undertaken by the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University (Manning et al 2010). It is recommended that both reports be consulted when use is being made of the connectivity mapping available. Reports can be downloaded from the EPSDD website at https://www.act.gov.au/environment/research-and-data/conservation-research-and-technical-reports (Technical reports 21 and 27).\nUpdates: This dataset is static. \nFit for purpose: 2012 temporal coverage. This dataset should be used as a modelled tool for aiding landuse, strategic town planning, and conservation planning in the ACT including revegetation targets and informing environmental impacts of infrastructure and building projects. Cell size 15x15m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n1.

Is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which:\n- May involve unstable and/or unpredictable variables and is therefore limited in its accuracy and applicability; and,\n- Will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.\n\n4. Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n\nAccordingly,\n\n1.

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations.The highest species abundance of foraminifera in core MD032607 was recorded by Globigerina bulloides (~45%) during the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6) and, generally, was the most abundant with an average abundance of 19.5%. The dominance of the sub-polar, transitional species, Ga. bulloides in this core suggests the influence of cold, nutrient-rich water during certain isotopic stages. Conversely, the dominant warm and oligotrophic species Globigerinoides ruber recorded its lowest abundance in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, and is totally removed from the record (0%) at 146K, 142K, and 139K yrs BP.",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2023 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2023 AIS data. This report - the 11th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",
