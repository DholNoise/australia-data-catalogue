The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the Autumn period between March 1989 to May 1989. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2002.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "GBR Queensland (Doherty): In the Great Barrier Reef the program is focused on seagrass beds in the middle of the GBR lagoon to understand how their abundance is affected by upwelling coming through the Magnetic and Palm Passages and on deepwater coral reefs on the outer GBR.  Although there is extensive monitoring of shallow water reefs along the extent of the GBR, there has been relatively little opportunity to monitor deeper reefs. Understanding the nature of these deepwater reefs may provide important insights into the resilience of the GBR to stresses such as changing temperatures, ocean acidification, cyclones and nutrient influx from the coast.  Surveys of the seagrass beds in the lagoon, which were designed to revisit sites surveyed using towed video ten years ago, and at Myrmidon Reef on the outer GBR were completed during July 2011 to establish benthic reference sites in this area.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "Data from the South West Wetlands Monitoring Program (SWWMP) 1977-2019 conducted by the Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) and its predecessors.\n\nIncluded are data from 158 wetlands most of which are within conservation reserves vested in the Conservation and Parks Commission of Western Australia and managed by DBCA.  Some are on private property.\n\nSWWMP began in 1977 with a decision in the former Department of Fisheries and Wildlife to commence a program of September and November water level monitoring on a large sample of south west wetlands in order to provide an objective basis for determining annual waterfowl hunting season specifications.  Salinity was also to be monitored because of its potential impact on waterfowl and their habitat.\n\n82 wetlands were monitored between 1977 and 1980. In 1981 the program was expanded to coincide with a four-year assessment of waterbird use of south west Wetland Nature Reserves by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.  The total number of wetlands monitored under SWWMP during this period was 119 and monitoring was conducted at two month intervals.  At the end of this assessment, SWWMP monitoring reverted to September and November each year and the number of wetlands being monitored was reduced to 85.\n\nRecreational waterfowl hunting in Western Australia was banned by the State Government in 1992, SWWMP was continued due to its value for management and investigation, however the number of wetlands was reduced and the focus shifted, with more emphasis on near-coastal freshwater wetlands and less on inland saline wetlands.  By 1996 only 60 wetlands were being monitored.\n\nIn November 1996, the Salinity Action Plan was released.  One of its strategic aims was to protect and restore high value wetlands and maintain biological diversity within agricultural areas of Western Australia.  Monitoring was recognised as necessary to determine the effectiveness of the plan, which stated \"CALM will monitor a sample of wetlands, and their associated flora and fauna, throughout the south west to determine long term trends in natural diversity and provide a sound basis for corrective action\". \n\nSince 1996 SWWMP monitoring was resumed at many wetlands with approximately 100 wetlands being monitored since 2000.\n\nIn 2018 SWWMP was discontinued, with a selection of 20 wetlands were monitored during September and/or November 2018.\n\nData is provided for all monitored wetlands in CSV format. Also included is a Data Description, Collector Codes and Information on the wetlands.\n\nBenchmark and gauge coordinates are provided for each wetland along with gauge establishment maintenance details in PDF format.\n\nAccess maps are provided in a ZIP archive of exported JPG maps.\n\nThe last SWWMP report (with data to 2016) is provided below, but there is a series of previous reports, some of which have additional information not provided in the last report.\n\n<strong><em>Note: to access the data, select the data source link located on the right-hand side.</em></strong>",

    "title": "Greenacre Park Stormwater Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is known as the Greenacre Park catchment. It is one of four catchment areas\nthat drain to the Upper Cooks River, which flows to Botany Bay through the Cooks River.\nThe study area is located mostly within the Sydney suburb of Greenacre, in the north-east\ncorner of the Bankstown Local Government Area. The catchment commences near\nGreenacre Road and flows in a northerly direction to the Hume Highway. From the Hume\nHighway, the catchment drains through the State Rail Authority’s Chullora Workshops to join\nthe Upper Cooks River.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for over 1,000 stormwater pits\nand 900 stormwater drainage pipelines. Photos of culverts and other sketches are also\nlinked to the database.\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. All pipes, drains and\ncreeks are included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

The reference stations increase the number of long term time series observations available to researchers, both in terms of variables recorded, temporal distribution and geographical extent. Data is collected using moored sensors and in monthly water sampling field trips. \n\nAs the project progresses NRS moorings will be fitted for telemetry and data will become available in real time from each of the NRS sites around Australia.\n\nThere are 7 current NRS sites: Two in Queensland, one in the Northern Territory, one in Western Australia, one in Tasmania, one in New South Wales and one in South Australia. There is one former site at Esperance, the mooring was retrieved in December 2013 and not redeployed; and one former site at Ningaloo Reef, with the mooring retrieved in August 2014 and not redeployed. Operation of the NRS sub-facility is distributed between several operators and is coordinated nationally.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

By combining radials measured at two stations surface current vectors can be constructed.  These surface current vectors can then be used to study tides, wind-driven currents and perform lagrangian particle tracking.\n\nRaw data collected at each radar site are re-processed by ACORN in order to assign quality control flags to data points.  This is not possible in real-time because real-time data are produced by proprietary manufacturer software without quality control flags and it is not feasible to transfer the raw data to ACORN in real-time.\n\nEach radial file contains a set of standard metadata fields, such as radar system type, operating frequency and bandwidth.  Other metadata fields describe radar system type-specific parameters.  Radial file metadata fields are described in a separate ACORN data document.\n\nIn addition, for WERA radar systems, ACORN provides quality controlled heights of left and right bragg peaks, from which the wind direction can be inferred.",

The arrays monitor ocean circulation and property variability in the ocean surrounding Australia and provide estimates of the ocean contribution to the regional and global circulation, heat and freshwater content and change. They will contribute to improved estimates of the regional and global sea level budget, improvements to the climate model simulations via direct comparison with observations, assimilation and development of improved model physics and parameterisations.\n\nThis sub-facility includes observational programs based on moored conductivity-temperature-depth sensors and current meter arrays in deep waters that are specifically targeted to monitor formation of Antarctic Bottom Water, interbasin exchange and major boundary currents. \n\nThe Deepwater array sites include :\n\n1) The Adelie Land Coast deep shelf to observe outflows of newly forming Antarctic Bottom water – the Polynya array.\n\n2) Timor Passage and Ombia Strait, to monitor the interbasin Indian-Pacific Ocean exchange and the upper limb of the global overturning circulation – the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) array.\n\n3) The east coast of Australia, near Brisbane, to monitor the East Australian Current transport – the EAC array.",

    "description": "This dataset presents locations of national surface hydrological features in Australia as points at the 1:250,000 scale. \nThe following features are included in this dataset:\n\n\nBore - A small diameter hole in the ground for the purpose of obtaining subterranean water by natural flow or mechanical pumping.\n\n\nDam - An open body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier consisting of earth, rock, concrete and/or masonry. Generally designed to capture run-off from the surrounding landscape or rainfall. The storage of water may occur on or below ground level.\n\n\nLock - An enclosure in a water body with gates at both ends to raise or lower the water level to enable vessels to pass from one level to another.\n\n\nGnamma Hole - Small holes of varying shape, diameter and depth, found in hard granite outcrops and in the decomposed granite of a breakaway, which can and usually does hold water.\n\n\nNative Well - An isolated natural depression which holds water, not within Watercourses. The natural phenomena is sometimes improved by indigenous persons for their own water collection purposes.\n\n\nPool - A small body of still or standing water, permanent or temporary in an isolated natural depression, not within Watercourses.\n\n\nRockhole - A hole excavated in solid rock by water action. \n\n\nSoak - A depression holding moisture after rain, especially the damp or swamp spots around the base of granite rocks.\n\n\nSpring - A place where water issues from the ground naturally.\n\n\nWaterfall Point - A sudden descent of water over a step or ledge in the bed of a watercourse.\n\n\nWaterhole - A natural depression which holds perennial water, within a non-perennial watercourse or a non-perennial lake.\n\n\nWater Tank - Water Tanks are storage containers for water, usually used for human consumption and other purposes such as irrigation, agriculture, fire suppression, agricultural farming and livestock, chemical manufacturing and food preparation. Water Tanks are constructed of various materials including plastic (polyethylene or polypropylene), fiberglass, reinforced concrete, steel (welded or bolted, carbon or stainless). Those used for human consumption are generally fully enclosed.\n\n\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-03-12\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to deaths due to all causes (combined) by sex. The reported statistics include year of death, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates, rate ratio, median age at death, premature deaths, potential years of life lost and potentially avoidable deaths. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any SA4 with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in June 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2012_T03.\n\nDeparted: \tLautoka, Fiji, June 06, 2012\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, June 17, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R0.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart, Australia, October 23, 2012\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, October 28, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

This data updates the previous EST_CATCH (Deakin) layer for use in the 2021 Index of Estuarine Condition.  Boundaries were determined from a digital elevation model (DEM) and were compared with DELWP boundaries for some estuaries (where DELWP data existed (i.e. in the estuary fluvial catchment layer [WATER_EST_FLUV_VSDL] available on the Victorian Spatial Data Library [January 2020]).  On steep land (the Otways, east Gippsland etc) the boundaries align well.  On the flatter areas there are some discrepancies between the DEM derived boundary and the DELWP derived boundary.  For some catchments the DELWP boundaries are more accurate, but for others the DEM derived boundary is more accurate. Final catchment boundaries were determined by adopting the DEM derived boundary where there was good alignment with the DELWP layer and then adjusting just the contested boundaries to choose the one that appeared most accurate based on the rationale specified for each estuary below.",

Bioregional conservation status and geographic occurrence are applied to unique Bioregion-EVC units.\n\nThe dataset underpins the implementation of Victoria's Native Vegetation Management Framework, and the preparation of Regional Vegetation Plans in addition to other biodiversity planning. The dataset requires upgrading when any of the three input datasets change.\n(Note that this dataset is stored in two Spatial Data Storage Environments within DSE - Arc/Info tiled libraries and Oracle/SDE single data layer. This metadata describes the Arc/Info dataset. The Oracle/SDE dataset is slightly different in that all non-vegetation classes are excluded from the data (ie. Bare rock, sand, non-native vegetation etc.) also the attributes include attributes expanded from Look Up Tables.

The data is based on 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp.

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2015 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 453,178 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2015 car parking event data there are 4,138 records where the parking event goes into 2016 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.17GB, 37.5 million rows)",

    "description": "These data sets include the picoplankton component analysed by flow cytometry from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. \n\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \n\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\n\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\n\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\n\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

    "description": "Core GC04, was collected from the southeastern side of the New Caledonian Basin (22.99965 S, 166.150716 E). Carbonate percent in the curve has an average value of ~79% and varies between 51.4% and 88.8%. Carbonate pecent does show small variations in scale and repeating patterns, however data tends to stay between 70-80%. It is interesting to note that the carbonate percent minimum of 51.4% occurs at the beginning of isotope stage 4 (~73Ka BP). This anomaly is relatively simultaneous to a decrease in 18O and slight increase in sedimentation rate. Significant non-carbonate sediments include glass shards, sub-rounded quartz, radiolarians, sponge spicules, manganese nodules and 'red opaque' material. Trends of glass shard and quartz percentages can be seen in the results. Radiolaria and sponge spicles tend not to show any definite trend, however both tend to increase subsequent to a broader non-carbonate sedimentation increase.",

    "title": "IMOS - AUV SIRIUS CAMPAIGN: TASMANIA, MARCH 2009",
    "description": "Tasmania (Barrett, Lucier - TAFI; Johnson, Ling - UTAS) The primary objective of this work was to describe biological assemblages associated with rocky reef systems in deep shelf waters on the Tasman Peninsula in SE Tasmania and in the Huon, Freycinet and Bruny Island Marine Protected Areas (MPA), providing a record of community composition at or near the time of designation of these MPAs. Detailed multibeam sonar bathymetry data were previously collected by Geoscience Australia (GA) to provide high-resolution digital elevation maps of the study areas. These maps were used to determine suitable AUV survey locations. At each location, multiple reefs were surveyed at a range of depths from approximately 50 m to 100 m depth. Dive profiles were designed to provide sufficient replication to quantitatively determine abundances of key species/features within depth strata, within reefs, between reefs (km to 100 km scale), and between differing levels of reef complexity. The AUV deployments were part of a multi-disciplinary experimental program to analyse the covariance of co-located fine-resolution seabed habitat data, provided by the EM3002 multibeam sonar coverage, and biological datasets collected at similar spatial scales by Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Baited Remote Underwater Video systems, towed video and the AUV. This program was undertaken with UTAS and GA as part of the Marine Biodiversity Research Hub, a collaborative program funded under the Commonwealth Government's Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities Program. In addition, the AUV completed high resolution, full seafloor coverage day and night dives at St Helens in the North East to document nocturnal feeding habits of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii whose poleward extension has had a significant impact on kelp beds in the North East of Tasmania.\n\nTasmania 03/2009\nScallop fisheries at Maria Island, Freycinet MPA; 9 dives over 5 days of operations; this trip ended prematurely with the grounding of the R/V Challenger.  A shackle securing the anchor to the anchor chain gave way and the ship blew onto rocks, destroying the Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) transceiver affixed to the ship that is used to track the AUV while it is underway.  This equipment was replaced using funding from the University of Sydney and a claim has been lodged with the University of Tasmania to recover the costs as the ship was being operated by TAFI.  A planned deployment in SA with SARDI was rescheduled as a consequence of this incident and we are looking into the availability of ship time to complete the proposed SA deployments.",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016</b> \n(Overlay Dataset 1 of 4, needs to be used in conjunction with riparian waterways and North Lakes Locality and Caboolture West Local Plan area datasets).\nThe Riparian and Wetland Setbacks Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

The voyage track leading from Cairns across the Coral Sea to Jomard Entrance, then across the Solomon Sea to St Georges Channel,eastern Manus Basin,and the Bismarck Sea, finishing in Rabul. This dataset has been processed and archived within the CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research Data Centre in Hobart. Additional information regarding this dataset is contained in the cruise report for this voyage and/or the data processing report (as available). The standard Underway (=continuously recorded) dataset from a research voyage includes Navigation (NAV), Sounder, Thermosalinograph (TSG) and Meteorological (MET) data. NAV data includes GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements of latitude, longitude, ship's direction and speed. MET data includes atmospheric temperature, humidity and pressure, wind speed and direction, and incident radiation intensity. Data are recorded at or averaged over 5 minute intervals.",

The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of low birthweight liveborn singleton babies, and the denominator as the total number of live births.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThis dataset uses the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of a low birthweight baby as weighing less than 2,500 grams.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid.\n\n\nMultiple births and stillbirths have been excluded.\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the total number of liveborn singleton babies for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

    "description": "Department of Water and Environmental Regulation Regional Boundaries were created as a result of the splitting of Department of Water and Environmental Regulation from the Department of Environment. At the time of creation the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation and Department of Environment boundaries were the same.\n\nDepartment of Environment regional boundaries defined by a combination of \nhydrographic basins, Local Government Authorities, National Heritage Trust and \nother administrative boundaries. Boundaries used for the effective delivery of departmental services across Western Australia. \n\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation administers a variety of environmental services to the public through 16 regional offices throughout Western Australia. Services include collection and analysis of water resources information, issuing licences, regulating water use, protecting the quality of our water, and preparation of policies and plans critical to the future development of Western Australia. The boundaries define the jurisdictional boundaries for regional offices to deploy DWER services.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Department of Water (DoW) Regional Boundaries (DOW-062)",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2017 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to map each surface water works with the volumetric entitlement without double counting the volume and to aggregate/ disaggregate the data depending on the final use.\n\n\n\nThis has been clipped to the Gloucester PAE.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\n1.\tJoe Bell (GA) has clipped the surface water licences to the Gloucester PAE. This clip contains the works associated with the sharecomponent/ entitlement. This can be a many to many relationship. . A work is a surface water extraction point.\n\nSW_licences_GloucesterPAE_Clip.dbf\n\n2.\tShare component/ entitlement information was stored in the     SW_Gloucester_COMBINED_v4.csv worksheet\n\n3.\tTotal volume of share component/ entitlement is 10,786ML \n\n4.\tThe works and share/component information was joined using Access, linking the CWlicence to the WAorCA_link. This links the volumetric entitlement to the works location.\n\n5.\tThis link also created share components that had a 0 entitlement which are licences that have been converted to unbundled licences in the new Water Act\n\n6.\tBy filtering out the 0 entitlement, the number of works linked to a share/component or entitlement with a specified  volume was 212 with a total of 10,786ML.   Worksheet FilteredIndividualSWLicences\n\n7.\tWhere there was more than one works per licence, an additional column was add COUNT_CWLICENSE. This shows where the share component/ entitlement is double counted as it is matched to each work with the full allocation.\n\n8.\tAn additional column was added SHARE_PER_WORKS which divides the share component/ entitlement by the number of works to give an allocation per works.\n\n9.\tThe SHARE_PER_WORKS column allows you to  plot the works with the share component in ArcGIS without double counting the allocation.\n\n10. A glossary of terms used ini the water licensing is included here:    http://registers.water.nsw.gov.au/wma/Glossary.jsp\n\n11.\tAn additional worksheet was added to aggregate the data into Water Sources and Management Zones. The Water Sources and Management Zones were provided by NSW Office of Water\n\nCombinedWSP_WSOURCES_31July2013.gdb\\Geographic_GDA94\\WSP_COMBINED_31July2013\n\n12.\tThe Avon River does not have management zones. Therefore data can only be viewed for the water source.\n\n13.\tAll other works can be aggregated to the Water Source, or the management zone depending on how you want to aggregate or disaggregate the data.\n\n\n\nrelevant fields:\n\nCWLICENSE: works licence number\n\nCOUNT_CWLICENSE: Where there was more than one works per licence\n\nSHARE_PER_WORKS: Share component divided by number of works to ensure no double counting\n\nSTATUS_DES: Status description as active, current, cancelled\n\nLICENCE_iS: licensed issued date\n\nLICENCE_LO: licence lodged date\n\nLICENCE_P: Licence purpose eg. stock and domestic, town supply, irrigation\n\nWORK_TYPE: pump, excavation etc\n\nWORK_TYPE_: diversion or storage\n\nMAJOR_CATC: major surface water catchement\n\nNAME_OF_TH: water sharing plan the licence belongs to\n\nWATER_SHAR: water sharing plan the licence belongs to\n\nWATER_SOUR: water source \n\nMANAGEMENT: management zone\n\nWSP_STATUS: Status of the water sharing plan\n\nSTART_DATE: Start date of the water sharing plan\n\nEND_DATE: end date of the water sharing plan\n\nLICENSEorAPPROVAL: licence or approval number\n\nStatus: Cancelled or current (or blank)\n\nShareC: Share component attached to the licence\n\nWAorCAlink:a combined water supply works / water use approval\n\nLINKED_TO_AL:This is the identification number for an access licence which is shown on the licence certificate or on a search printout of the licence obtained from the access licence register run by Land and Property Information.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) NSW Office of Water SW licences - Gloucester PAE v2 21022014.

    "title": "A survey of the breeding seabirds and migratory shorebirds of the Houtman Abrolhos, Western Australia",
    "description": "A complete survey of the numbers and breeding stages of seabirds, resident and migratory shorebirds and raptors at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, central west coast, Western Australia, was undertaken. One hundred and ninety two (192) islands, islets and rocks were surveyed over 21 days in December 2006.\n\nSeabird nesting habitat was mapped in its entirety for those islands considered as significant breeding areas (i.e. Pelsaert Island, Leo Island) and estimates of both breeding and roosting seabirds were made for each island. Notes on the stage of breeding were also taken, and where applicable, eggs were measured and weighed for some species to\nobtain breeding dates. Monitoring transects were established on West Wallabi and Pelsaert Islands to monitor longer term changes in the nesting density of the Wedge-tailed Shearwater Ardenna pacifica, Lesser Noddy Anous tenuirostris melanops, Common (Brown) Noddy Anous stolidus and Sooty Tern Onychoprion fuscata. The Lesser Noddy transects\nhad been previously established by Fuller and Burbidge (1992), and were used again for comparative purposes.\n\nWe recorded 14 species of seabirds, 16 species of migratory shorebirds, three resident shorebirds and two raptors during this survey. Of these, 14 species of seabirds, three resident shorebirds and the two raptors were breeding. These breeding populations are considered significant in a regional and national context. Of the 192 islands surveyed, 148 (77%) had breeding seabirds.",

    "description": "Core MD88-779 was taken during the 1988 French APSARA IV cruise in the South East Indian Ocean. The core was situated on the South Tasman Rise (47º50.690S, 146º32.750E) at a depth of 2260m. Although the core recovered was 6.7m long, only the top 2.6m were studied as preliminary investigations had indicated that this section covered the last two glacial cycles.\n\nAnalysis of the sediment identified phytoliths in the core material. This is significant as this was the first known report of phytoliths in core material this south of Australia. Phytolith material was observed sporadically down-core at the following levels; 0, 130, 140, 220 and 230 cm (approximately falling within the Holocene, 100-110 ka, and 170 ka respectively). The phytolith casts most readily identifiable were those comprising the grasses, although larger plate-like casts of trees and shrubs were observed.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for November 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "###_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. \r\nWe have published explanatory notes to help you understand this dataset.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS.\r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the ACNC website.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click here to view them.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis database supersedes the previous version GIP AssetList Database v1.2 20150130, correcting Asset identifiers (AID) that were duplicated between databases. \n\nThis dataset contains the spatial and non-spatial (attribute) components of the Gippsland bioregion Asset List as two .mdb files, which are readable as an MS Access database or as an ESRI Personal Geodatabase.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Gippsland are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Gippsland bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed.\n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"AssetList_database_GIP_v1p3_20150212.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset.\n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.\n\n\n\nDetailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"AssetList_database_GIP_v1p3_20150212.doc\" located in the zip file.\n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe Asset List Database was developed to identify water dependent assets located within the Gippsland bioregion.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe title of this dataset was changed from \"GIP AssetList Database v1.3 20150212\" on 20 April 2015.\n\nSource codes for input datasets that are not yet registered and are therefore unable to be linked to this database via BADMS are as follows:\n\n- ECON_SW_VIC_RegRiv\n\n- ECON_SW_VIC_UnRegRiv\n\n\n\nThis dataset is an update of the previous version of the Gippsland asset list database: \"Gippsland Asset List V1 20141210\"; ID: 112883f7-1440-4912-8fc3-1daf63e802cb, which was updated with the inclusion of a number of additional datasets from the Victorian Department of the Environment and Primary Industries as identified in the \"linkages\" section and below.\n\n\n\nVictorian Farm Dam Boundaries\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/311a47f9-206d-4601-aa7d-6739cfc06d61\n\n\n\nFlood Extent 100 year extent West Gippsland Catchment Management Authority GIP v140701\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/dataset/2ff06a4f-fdd5-4a34-b29a-a49416e94f15\n\n\n\nIrrigation District Department of Environment and Primary Industries GIP\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/880d9042-abe7-4669-be3a-e0fbe096b66a\n\n\n\nLandscape priority areas (West)\n\nWest Gippsland Regional Catchment Strategy Landscape Priorities WGCMA GIP 201205\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/6c8c0a81-ba76-4a8a-b11a-1c943e744f00\n\n\n\nPlantation Forests Public Land Management(PLM25) DEPI GIP 201410\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/495d0e4e-e8cd-4051-9623-98c03a4ecded\n\n\n\nand additional data identifying \"Vulnerable\" species from the datasets:\n\nVictorian Biodiversity Atlas flora - 1 minute grid summary\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/d40ac83b-f260-4c0b-841d-b639534a7b63\n\n\n\nVictorian Biodiversity Atlas fauna - 1 minute grid summary\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/516f9eb1-ea59-46f7-84b1-90a113d6633d\n\n\n\nA number of restricted datasets were used to compile this database.

It includes field quality parameters, methane concentrations and major and minor ion concentrations.  It is based on the following data sources:   GA compiled hydrochemistry datasets:  Surface water data from the Queensland water monitoring information portal (https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au/), accessed and downloaded in January 2019; Data from EHS Support (2014) Water baseline assessment (ATP1087) prepared for Armour Energy.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nA hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on groundwater and surface water datasets from the Isa GBA region. For this purpose, nine variables (Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO3, Cl, SO4, electrical conductivity and pH) which were measured across most hydrochemical records were selected. Prior to the multivariate statistical analysis, all variables except for pH were log-transformed to ensure that each variable more closely follows a normal distribution. The multivariate statistical technique is described in more details by Raiber et al. (2012) and Raiber et al. (2016).",

A seismic traverse was recorded between Lake Galilee No. 1 well and outcrops of the Drummond Group 80 km to the east. This area is covered by Cainozoic sediments and no seismic network has been attempted before the present survey. The area is of economic interest, as oil was recorded in a drill stem test in Lake Galilee No. 1 well in Carboniferous sediments in the interval 2890 to 2910 m and there are coal measures in the Upper Permian. Knowledge of the structure of the basin margin to the east of the well could reveal oil traps and economically mineable coal deposits. For the other two Galilee Basin surveys, please see L106 and L108.",

Read the complete annual report https://www.psba.qld.gov.au/publications/annualReport/Pages/default.aspx\nNote:\nOn 7 September 2020, the Queensland Government announced its intention to integrate the PSBA functions and staff into the public safety agencies of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES), as part of a wider strategy to structurally reform government statutory bodies and agencies and increase further efficiencies in the delivery of quality outcomes to Queensland communities. \nOn 27 May 2021, the Queensland Parliament passed the Debt Reduction and Savings Bill which repealed the Public Safety Business Agency Act 2014, resulting in the PSBA being abolished from 1 July 2021.\nThe disestablishment of the PSBA and the corresponding functional transition into the QPS and QFES, as per the Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 2) 2021 (AAO), was completed by 30 June 2021.\nDue to the disestablishment of the PSBA, all Open Data records within the Queensland Open Data Portal relating to the PSBA have been migrated to QPS.\nFor enquires or further information about the PSBA, please contact the QPS or QFES using the comments section or the contact us page.",

The data spans the months of 2013 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nGross Benefit Sodicity (gb97e = p97e a pfe97) ($/ha/yr) dataset is one of 11\nnational surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic\nopportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in\n1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the number of distinct specialist homeless services clients by client type, sex and age group. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has set suppressed values (\".\") as Null.",

The Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) produces Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) satellite SST products in the International Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) GDS2 file formats for Himawari-8 in real time and delayed mode. This product is composed of reprocessed multi-swath SSTskin retrievals obtained from compositing IMOS Himawari-8 hourly L3C files over the night (before dawn).  \n\nEvery 10 minutes, the Himawari-8 full disk is processed to retrieve SSTs by using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTTOV12.3) and Bayesian cloud clearing method based on the ESA CCI SST code developed at the University of Reading. The hourly product on native grid is then produced by compositing over multiple swaths for the previous 1 hour by selecting the highest quality data with priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour. The L3C-01hour product on native grid is then remapped over the 0.02-degree IMOS grid to compose IMOS L3C-01hour product (Govekar et al., 2021,  https://www.foo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Govekar_FOO_2021.pdf). The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2.",

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was subsequently accepted for inclusion upon the World Heritage List in 1981, meeting all four of the natural heritage criteria: geological phenomena, ecological and biological processes, aesthetics and natural beauty, and biological diversity (including threatened species).\r\n\r\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 provides for the establishment, control, care and development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Since the gazettal of the first area (or Section) of the Marine Park in 1983, the Marine Park has been progressively increased to its present area by the addition of new Sections. The Amalgamated Great Barrier Reef Section (the AGBR Section) was proclaimed under subsection 31(1) of the Act in 2003 (Gazette No S119 dated 21 April 2004).\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a representation of the boundaries described in the schedules of the 2003 Zoning Plan for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). The Zoning Plan identifies 8 different zones within the marine park and sets out the purposes of use for each zone. The zones are:\r\n\r\nGU - General Use Zone \r\nHP - Habitat Protection Zone \r\nCP - Conservation Park Zone \r\nB - Buffer Zone \r\nSR - Scientific Research Zone \r\nMNP - Marine National Park Zone \r\nP - Preservation Zone \r\nCommonwealth Islands Zone \r\n\r\nFor further information regarding marine park zoning please refer to publications on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) website: http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/",

The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Caboolture West Local Plan and  North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "Craterocephalus fluviatilis is a small freshwater fish, native to the floodplains of the southern MurrayDarling Basin. They were once widespread and abundant throughout their range; however the species has suffered a serious decline in abundance and distribution, and are now considered one of the most threatened vertebrate species in Australia. Murray Hardyhead is rare in NSW and only a few isolated populations occur in Victoria and South Australia. All populations are threatened by declining water levels, habitat loss and impacts of pest fish (including Gambusia, Redfin and Carp).\nIt is listed as a ‘critically endangered’ species in NSW under the Fisheries Management Act 1994.\nhttps://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/species-protection/what-current/critically-endangered-species/murray-hardyhead.\nThis indicative distribution was derived from survey records and expert opinion.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "The Turquoise Coast (TURQ) HF ocean radar system covers the area of shelf between Seabird and Jurien Bay and is the logical continuation of major research efforts to understand the role of the Leeuwin Current System (Leeuwin Current, the Leeuwin Undercurrent and Capes Current) in controlling not only the physical system but also its links to both pelagic and benthic ecosystems.  In contrast to eastern ocean basins, which are highly productive, Western Australia experiences an oligotrophic environment. The Leeuwin Current is a shallow (<300 m deep), narrow band (< 100 km wide) of warm, lower salinity, nutrient depleted water of tropical origin that flows poleward from Exmouth to Cape Leeuwin and into the Great Australian Bight.  The Current plays a dominant role in controlling the marine life and climate of the region.  \n\nQuestions which may be addressed by using the HF ocean radar data from TURQ (and ROT) include the variability of the Leeuwin current and its response to the ENSO cycle;  Leeuwin Current eddies and their interaction with the shelf waters; and the interaction between the Leeuwin Current, the Capes Current and coastal current during the summer.  This is an important region for Western Rock lobster recruitment, and the meanders of the warm Leeuwin Current influence the ecology.  This is a region with low tidal range and with a coastline subject to strong sea breezes and intense winter storms.  Coastally trapped waves may be generated by the winter weather systems and by tropical cyclones in the summer.  \n\nThe TURQ HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Seabird (31.281 S 115.444 E) and Cervantes (30.506 S  115.060E). From 2012-12-15T11:00:00 the Cervantes station has been replaced by the Green Head station (30.073 S 114.967E) and from 2013-03-19T00:00:00 the Seabird station has been replaced by the Lancelin station (31.027 S 115.328 E). These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km\nand a range resolution of 3 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThe TURQ area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Rottnest Shelf (ROT) WERA HF ocean radar system on its south side.  Together, the TURQ and ROT systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle to Jurien Bay.",

The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2016 projection, relative to a 2011 baseline, based on a scenario of buildings being retrofitted.

The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

Four cores were assigned to each of three treatments, which were low dose (3.5mls effluent per minute), high dose (7mls effluent per minute) or no dose of effluent. The experiment ran for 14 days in October 1997. \n\nThroughout the experimental period, dissolved oxygen levels were measured and animals that migrated from the sediment were collected, counted and identified. At the end of the experiment, sediment chlorophyll levels were measured and infauna remaining in the sediment were counted and identified.",

    "description": "The Crater Line consists of a series of rock exposures outcropping in an arcuate pattern around the southwestern flank of the Rum Jungle granite. The exposed rocks are believed to represent part of the Brocks Creek group of Lower Proterozoic age. The Crater formation, the major mappable unit in the line of exposures, consists of metamorphosed clastic rocks totalling approximately 1500 feet in thickness. Significant radioactivity is restricted to three stratigraphic zones within the Crater formation. These have been mapped and are designate Crater Pebble Beds, Number One Pebble Bed, and Number Two Pebble Bed. Number One Pebble Bed appears to contain the most significant anomalies. The radioactivity is restricted to conglomerate beds. There may be a genetic relationship to the greater permeability formerly localized in the conglomeratic zones. The radioactivity is not localized by tectonic structures such as folds, faults, or changes in dip. No source of the radioactivity has been identified. The radioactivity probably emanates from members of the uranium disintegration series. Four areas containing significant anomalies and deserving further investigation were found along the Crater Line.",

    "description": "The 2019 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development, and job satisfaction. The census ran from 6 May to 7 June 2019. Overall, 104,471 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 77%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2019 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2019 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2019 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2019 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2019 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2019 APS employee census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2019 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2019 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

    "description": "We must understand the natural cycles of the oceans to understand the evolution of our climate through geological time. Core MD 002361 was obtained in 2000 off the coast of Sumatra (113.477166 E, 22.082 S). By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information regarding past oceanographic and climatic systems. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile of the core (revealing sedimentation rates), the relative abundance of planktonic foraminifera over time, and estimates of historical sea-surface temperatures. The core description highlights the stark contrast between glacial and interglacial periods with 1-1.5m bands of red clay indicating interglacial periods, alternating with the 1-1.5m bands of light grey foraminifera sand deposited during the glacial periods.",

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

Piggyback project: Dinoflagellates &amp; broader planktonic assemblage observation.\nThe Dual-Head Kongsberg EM2040c multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry,  backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter at 3 focused site north of Cairns. An additional site, Lowry passage, was also systematically surveyed with the system.\nThe EM2040c provides a 1.3 degree by 1.3 degree angular resolution. The echosounder's nominal frequency is 300 kHz and it operated in dual-head single swath mode.\nData are stored in .all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .wcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 701 files totalling 174 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nPredicted tides calculated in AusTides 2022 were applied to the processed data relative to MSL. Processed data had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format, and processed bathymetry and backscatter grids in geotiff format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "title": "Urban Forest Mesh Blocks - 2009 (DPLH-034)",
    "description": "Based on Landgate’s high resolution aerial imagery, CSIRO generate the Urban Monitor mosaic from which vegetation height strata of endemic and exotic species has been calculated and reported as an area for each height strata of 0 – 3 m, 3 – 8 m, 8 – 15 m and 15+ m. The area of grass covered areas falling into the 0 – 50 cm range has also been calculated and recorded in square metres. Vegetation coverage greater than 3 metres in height has been deemed tree canopy. The canopies have been aggregated and reported as total canopy coverage in square metres. Urban Forest Mesh Blocks have been published for the following years: 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018.\n\nParcels to be analysed were sourced from the 2016 Integrated Land Information Database (ILID) and supplied to CSIRO by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. The results were assembled into Urban Forest features where the Urban Monitor coverage was complete.\n\nLand parcels were assigned locational data (2016 ABS meshblocks, suburbs, local government authority (LGA) and planning sub-region) based on the parcel centroid. They were then attributed with the following land use categories: • Street Block: residential, commercial, industrial, hospital/medical, educational, and some agricultural and transport land uses • Parks: public parks, open space, private recreation grounds and State Forest • Roads: roads including road reserves • Other Infrastructure: rail, airports and utilities infrastructure • Other: land uses in transition that have not progressed sufficiently to be Street Blocks or do not conform to urban form • Rural: primary production land that does not fall in categories above • Water: ocean and other waterways, including reservoirs\n\nThe vegetation height strata areas and total canopy coverage values were calculated for each land parcel. The statistics were then aggregated by the field MB_MonitorCategory, a concatenation of the fields MB_CODE16 and MonitorCategory. Canopy coverage percentages and ranges were calculated based on the sum of the area of parcels within each MB_MonitoryCategory. As parcels with sufficient Urban Monitor coverage for Urban Forest analysis may vary between years making comparison difficult, a field called MBPercentage was added which shows the percentage of the total MB_MonitorCategory area (MBArea) covered by parcels with Urban Forest values for that year. Corresponding MBPercentage values for all published years were also added to inform users.\n\nNOTE: As mesh block attributes were assigned based on parcel centroid, aggregated mesh block boundaries based on the parcels may not match ABS mesh block boundaries, and MBAreas will not match ABS mesh block areas.

    "description": "PSR J1757-1854 is the most relativistic galactic double neutron star system. Its eccentricity makes it an ideal playground for gravity experiments with pulsar timing. Via observations of its profile evolution, we can constraint its rate of geodetic precession. Currently, there are four possible geometric configurations that explain the time evolution of the polarisation swing. The geodetic precession and the Lense-Thirring effect will eventually manifest themselves in the post-Keplerian parameters within the next decade, allowing for two further tests of gravity. We propose to observe it with Parkes UWL every two months to track the profile evolution in this pulsar, and to derive times of arrival for an eventual detection of the affected Post-Keplerian parameters. These observations will be added to joint GBT and (past) MeerKAT observations, and they will be part of a long-term, global observational program of this pulsar.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) hydro systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the period between the years of 2001-2018 and is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-06-2019.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2019. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

Nest, egg and chick counts are made in a representative part of the wetland to characterise the colony and to estimate colony breeding success.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin.

    "description": "The map presents the distribution of the likelihood of koala occurrence across NSW based on publicly available data held in the Atlas of NSW Wildlife (www.bionet.nsw.gov.au). The proportion (’p’ column) of koalas (‘Koala’ column) recorded relative to a suite of arboreal mammals is presented in a 10 kilometre grid across NSW. A separate 5 kilometre grid is also available for Koala Management Area (KMA) 1 – North Coast. A measure of the confidence (‘Conf’ column) in the likelihood estimate is also presented. \nIn KMA 1 Atlas of NSW Wildlife (Bionet) record data has been supplemented with data from koala spot assessment (SAT) survey along with “rapid SAT” method undertaken where major data deficiencies remained. SAT surveys observation efforts and resulting koala records were used in the same manner as arboreal mammal records. This map can be used to inform the likely occurrence of koalas and informing decisions on mitigation of activities such as native forestry.\nDistance\nKoala Likelihood Mapping 5 km - 5 km Grid Cell\nKoala Likelihood Mapping 10 km - 10 km Grid Cell",

    "description": "Existing satellite data were analysed in order to characterise seasonal and inter-annual variation in remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a. To maximize spatial and temporal coverage we used merged data from SeaWIFS, MERIS, and MODIS produced by the ESA using the GSM algorithm (Maritorena and Siegel, 2005; Globcolour Project). We merged normalized water-leaving radiances (not individual chl-a algorithm outputs) within 4.6 km grid over a period of more than 16 years. Monthly averages of chlorophyl-a concentration (mg m-3) are presented. Attempts were made to correlate the data with Solander Underway data. These data were not validated. Encrypted ncdf4 files can be found at the Perth Pawsey Computer centre.\nThe Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) was an initiative designed to enhance the net conservation benefits of the globally-significant coral reef ecosystems of the Pilbara (Western Australia) by providing an assessment of the condition and trajectory of key ecological values. These assessments were designed to inform and complement existing governance and management arrangements and the PMCP is intended to provide ongoing advice and assessment for conservation efforts in the region, providing lasting benefits.\nThe PMCP concept is based on three core ecological components, namely:\nCoral Reef Health - concentrating mainly on habitat forming primary producers.\nFish and Sharks - their community structure, interactions and impacts on lower trophic levels.\nEnvironmental Pressures - physical and anthropogenic factors that influence the condition of reefs and associated biota.",

    "description": "Avoca Lagoon is the largest of the four coastal lagoons within Gosford. The lagoon has a cruciform shape\nwith a surface area of 97.5 hectares and average depth of 1.3 metres. The let-out-level is approximately 2\nmetres above mean sea level. The lagoon entrance is normally closed due to the action of coastal dynamic\nprocesses which result in the formation of a beach berm across the lagoon entrance, linking Avoca and\nNorth Avoca beaches.\nGosford City Council has records of openings of the Avoca Lagoon entrance commencing in 1972. These\nrecords show that the entrance has been opened 58 times over the period 1976 to 2003, primarily for flood\ncontrol purposes. The entrance has broken out naturally on four other occasions when floodwaters caused\nthe lagoon level to rise above the level of the beach berm.\nRecords of inundation of Avoca Lagoon by ocean storms are not as complete as those available for the\nopening of the entrance. Limited data are available for severe ocean storms in May 1974, June 1978 and\nAugust 1986 when waves overtopped the beach berm and entered the lagoon.\n\nThe floodplain management process seeks to promote the adoption of an integrated approach to the management of all lands within the Avoca Lagoon catchment.\nThis floodplain management study addresses the following issues:\n<ul>\n<li>existing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>environmental and planning considerations;</li>\n<li>future development;</li>\n<li>climatic change;</li>\n<li>flood damages;</li>\n<li>floodplain management options;</li>\n<li>floodplain management impacts;</li>\n<li>floodplain management economics;</li>\n<li>preferred floodplain management strategies.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Project Overview\nCambridge Coastcare (‘CCC’), a Western Australian coastal community organisation, contracted OmniDrone, an Australian ‘drone’ operator, in mid-2021 to perform an aerial survey by drone of limited sections of Floreat Beach on Perth’s Indian Ocean coastline, as a continuing part of CCC’s ‘Improving Coastal Dune Monitoring &amp; Management’ project. This project’s primary objectives were…\n\nTo assess the suitability of drone-deployed systems for illustrating and accurately quantifying the changing topography of beach dunes, and…\nTo report on the sand erosion and accretion changes for the Floreat Beach dunes over the period 2018 to 2022.\n\nCCC obtained a WA Government grant to undertake this project under the Government’s ‘CoastWest’ coastal management initiative. This report, along with the considerable survey data and imagery acquired over the period, is the final deliverable per the terms of that grant.\nThis document reports on aerial surveys of Floreat Beach undertaken by ‘drone’ (more formally, ‘RPAS – Remotely Piloted Aircraft System’) conducted by drone operators ‘RemSense’, ‘OmniDrone’ and then ‘GeoCue’, sequentially over the period 2018 to 2022.\nThis report compares the findings across the 2018 to 2022 surveys at discrete sections of Floreat Beach, to illustrate and quantify dune erosion and accretion differences for these beach sections.
