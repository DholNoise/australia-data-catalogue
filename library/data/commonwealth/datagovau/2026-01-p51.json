    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows business establishments with their trading name, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, location and CLUE block and small area allocation. The data covers the year period of 2013.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has acquired the data through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "The Other Structure Feature Class sits within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Assets Geodatabase. The Other Structure layer includes infrastructure items associated with historic heritage such as historic ruins, lighthouses, monuments, silos and stockyards as well as other miscellaneous features such as beacons, channel markers and wildlife structures.\n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially. The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes. The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS. The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field. AMS is also set up to be used by other OEH Divisions eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point. \n\nDetailed documentation is available including: - Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets) - Data Model - Business Rules - Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed. Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) hydro systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data is available for May 2020 and June 2020, and it also includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 7 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "The Kimberley 400m mooring (IMOS platform code KIM400) is part of the Kimberley array. It was initially deployed on the 03/02/2012 at (15.93 S, 123.55 E). The site depth is 396m. This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2021 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2021 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2021 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

The second component is a log where start and end bottom times need to be recorded for instruments for example the benthic trawl.  There is one file for each of the logs.  Both logs need to be ideally merged into one to have one data source of event information.  The start and end bottom times need to ideally go into the event logging system on the ship.\n      \n      1) Event log for stations and all instrument deployments\n      \n      Stations and instrument deployments were recorded (including failures) over the progress of the voyage to provide a summary of all work carried out over voyage and and assigned an Event ID number for referencing data associated with these events.\n      \n      Data_Format \n      \n      Data was initially recorded in the ship board PostgreSQL database.

This service includes all the bathymetry data collected during the survey, with the data also available as a free download from the Geoscience Australia website.\n\nThe aim of the survey was to acquire industry-standard precompetitive 2D seismic data, Multi-beam echo-sounder (MBES) and sub-bottom profiling (SBP) data to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the basin. The survey, undertaken as part of the Department of Industry and Science's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP), aimed to identify and characterise indicators of natural hydrocarbon or fluid seepage that may indicate compromised seal integrity in the region. The data collected during this survey will enhance sequence stratigraphic studies in the Gippsland Basin that provide constraints on the most suitable areas for storage of CO2 and help to identify potential CO2 storage reservoirs.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne employs a contractor to perform traffic counts on roads throughout the municipality. The numbers of vehicles are recorded per hour and split into 12 categories based on the Austroads vehicle classification. Vehicle class 13 is used when the type of vehicle can’t be determined.\n\nIn the 2017/16 surveys all bikes, motorcycles and maximum speeds were captured. In the 2015 surveys not all surveys captured bikes, motorcycles and maximum speed. In the 2014 surveys no bikes, motorcycles or maximum speed were captured.\n\nThis data is designed to be joined to the road corridor data on road_segment and seg_id. Some records have more than one road segment this is because the survey crosses intersecting roads and the intersections have a road segment number. In the Road corridor table some road segments will have the same seg_id.\n\n\nFor a description of each field please see the attached data dictionary.\n\n<b>Known data issues:</b>\n- 112 records had vehicle_class fields which contained the character '-'. This should value should be a 0 value.",

It was provided to\nGeoscience Australia in early 2011 by PRL.\nThis shapefile is a first pass only. There is the possibility of adding further cleared areas\nthrough closer inspection of the orthophoto’s and redefining some of the edges to more\nclosely represent the area cleared.\nThe Pre-PRL Clearing data was digitized by hand by PRL in October 2010 from aerial photographs taken in 1976, 1982 and 1987. The 1976 image was used first,\nthen 1982, then 1987 making sure that each polygon snapped to the last.\nGenerally digitises at 1:5000 although this is variable.\nAll polygons have been assigned an attribute and the year represent the first time the area is\nindicated as being cleared off the orthophoto.\nThis data is logical as each attributed year shows the progress of clearing across Christmas\nIsland in a logical manner.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer mortality statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 5 top cancer groupings (breast - female only, colorectal, lung, melanoma of the skin and prostate) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA3. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA3 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013.

    "description": "This dataset displays the position and extents of fuel breaks that have been identified to be upgraded in the RFMP 2019-28. Strategic fuel breaks are usually located between assets and surrounding rural areas or bushland. Fuel breaks typically consist of an area of variable width next to an existing track or road where bushfire fuels are maintained at lower levels. The lower fuel levels within fuel breaks result in much reduced fire behaviour. In this way, they provide a defensible space in which fire fighters may work with increased safety to protect assets, usually associated with back-burning activities during fire suppression operations. They also provide an opportunity to ‘break-up’ fire runs and assist with prescribed burning operations.",

    "description": "Contemporary refugia contain communities that are strongly associated with climatic and topographic factors that confer a degree of protection from endangering processes such as fire and disease. These refugia have two important roles: they provide locations for the conservation of species and communities and they provide sources for population expansion if limiting conditions abate. \n\nPlaces qualifying as refuges from frequent fire do so because, although they contain plants sensitive to fire, they are protected in the landscape by climatic, topographic and soil features. It is generally accepted, however, that very few, if any, places have totally escaped the effects of fire in Tasmania and that refugia will have occasionally been burnt under extreme fire conditions. But such events are considered much rarer in these places in comparison with areas that lack the protection afforded by refugia. It is the low frequency of burning that marks these places as significant. \n\nAfter wildfire, forest communities associated with refugia are usually slower to recover and may take many decades, even centuries, to do so.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:100 000 scale). Refugia from present processes are coded with a unique number and the relevant National Estate values and criteria.\n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criterion A2: Importance in maintaining existing processes or natural systems at the regional or national scale.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1997.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "WA Tomorrow is a series of population forecasts for the State of Western Australia based on historical trends. The forecasts represent the best estimate of future population size if trends in fertility, mortality and migration continue.\n\nWA Tomorrow uses a hybrid geography, but reflects as closely as possible the current Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2021, produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (See Geography tab). The forecasts refer to the 30 June in each stated year.\n\nWA Tomorrow includes three forecast bands (Lower, Central, Upper), indicating three probable futures. For the user who requires the best estimate of future population size, the central forecast should be used. \nFor further information please consult the <a href=\"https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-planning-lands-and-heritage/western-australia-tomorrow-12-population-forecasts\">WA Tomorrow 12 website</a>",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nAsset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion (SSB) on 18 December 2015 (v1.1) supersedes the previous version of the SSB Asset database V1.0 (Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 03 August 2015, GUID: e453be86-2ddc-488b-9490-2e7c9ee130b7). It contains the Asset database (SSB_asset_database_20151218.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (SSB_asset_database_20151218_GISOnly.gdb), a data dictionary (SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the Water Asset Information Tool (WAIT) process as outlined below. This version should be used for Materiality Test (M2) test.\n\n\n\nThe user needs to join the Table Assetlist  or Elementlist  to the spatial data.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Sydney regions are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Sydney Basin bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20151218.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\t              Notes\n\n1\t               1.0\t               3/08/2015\tInitial database.\n\n2\t               1.1\t               18/12/2015\t\"(1) Added 93 assets/9897elements from 18 datasets required by SSB asset workshop.\n\n                                                                                      (2) Fixed 22 AIDs in spatial data, which can not directly join  to relevant table in asset database\"\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 18 December 2015.

    "title": "Spatial causal network for green hydrogen production in the Upper Spencer Gulf region, South Australia",
    "description": "This dataset was compiled by the Water for Sustainable Hydrogen project from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The spatial causal network comprises a rigorous and comprehensive scientific assessment of potential causal pathways by which hydrogen and renewable energy development can affect environmental assets. The network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.",

Regional Department of Environment officers identified areas of similar management requirements to define boundaries or aggregations of hydrographic subcatchments. Regions with notable management concerns both currently and possibly in the future were identified to become management subareas. Management subareas will be used in the calculation of sustainable yields, flow rates and ultimately these calculations will be available for water allocation and natural resource management decisions. In addition, native vegetation clearing values have been calculated for each of the subareas located within the extent of the South-West region of Western Australia, for input into the allocation process.\n\nThe Surface Water subarea data was developed in order to give a clear understanding of surface water availability and to provide management tools to make good water allocation and natural resources management decisions.\n\nDataset was formerly known as Surface Water Management Subareas (DOW-021)",

Data are available from approximately 80 GBR sites, 16 Coral Sea sites, 7 sites in North West Western Australia (WA), 8 Queensland regional ports, 13 sites in the Solitary Islands, 4 sites in PNG and 10 sites in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Data are obtained from in-situ data loggers deployed on the reef. Data loggers instantaneously record sea temperatures every 30 minutes and are exchanged and downloaded approximately every 12 months. Temperature loggers on the reef-flat are generally placed just below Lowest Astronomical Tide level. Reef-slope (or where specified as Upper reef-slope) generally refers to depths 5 - 9 m while Deep reef-slope refers to depths of ~20 m.",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST012009.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, New South Wales, January 25, 2009\nArrived:  \tWellington, New Zealand, February 1, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This report describes the hydraulic modelling for the first stage of a flood study of the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley commissioned by the Water Board in 1987. The study is required in order to \"determine the effects that various arrangements of major or future works for Warragamba Dam have on flooding in the valley\" (Revised Brief for the Preparation of an E.I.S., Water Boards August 1987). Stage 1 required a simplified model to be developed, calibrated and used to provide a measure of the relative effects on flooding of options for such works.\nThe model used is described in Section 2. Section 3 describes the calibration phase, in which three historical floods were used to adjust model parameters in order to match historical and modelled flood heights. The various options for Warragamba Dam flood protection works have an impact on the outflow hydrographs from the dam. Outflow hydrographs were determined for each option for five \"design\" floods and run through the calibrated hydraulic model. Peak flood heights were then tabulated and compared at three key locations In the valley. Section 4 describes the options while Section 5 discusses the modelling methods used to run these cases. The results are presented as a series of tables and graphs.",

The 2016 Interpretation of TEMPEST Airbourne Electromagnetic Data from Esperance (Mira Geoscience) was also used in creating this dataset. This location can change pending known factors that impact the location of the seawater interface including the time of year, tidal movements, abstraction, recharge and throughflow.  \n\nThe full assessment of the SWI in this area is documented in report HR437 Esperance Seawater Interface Priority Area Assessment.\n\nThis dataset is sourced from the Statewide Seawater Interface Project, funded by the Government of Western Australia under the State Groundwater Investigation Program. \n\nIn the Esperance area, the project runs from April 2020 to March 2023 and the data are collected from: \n- Seawater interface monitoring (SWIM) bores installed or owned by the department\n- Downhole natural gamma and induction logging\n- Installation of data loggers and continuous static groundwater level (SWL) measurements from data loggers\n- Electrical conductivity (EC) depth profiling\n- Groundwater chemistry sampling.\n- Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey.\nThe above data that is owned by the department can be downloaded from the Water Information Reporting (WIR) Portal or by contacting the Department. AEM survey data can be downloaded via the interactive geological map tool GeoVIEW.WA from the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety.\n\nInformation on the SWI project can be found on the Western Australia State Government website (www.wa.gov.au).",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the works details from with surface water licences from NSW in the Gloucester & Hunter region. The short guide to NSW Office of Water's licensing data has been provided to accompany the dataset (both the spatial locations and the associated licence details). \n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act).\n\n2.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n3.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n4.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n5.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading).

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology.

The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The process of estimating IFDs, known as frequency analysis, is an important part of hydrological design procedures. An analysis of rainfall data from a single station is often unreliable; not temporally or spatially consistent; and should generally not be used for design purposes. Instead a set of accurate, consistent IFD data was derived for the whole of Australia by the Bureau of Meteorology as part of the revision of Australian Rainfall and Runoff with the Institute of Engineers Australia(1987). INTENSITY is the rainfall rate (in mm per hour), FREQUENCY is how often a type of rainfall event will occur and DURATION is the period of time over which the rain is measured. There are 3 files covering the 2, 24, 72 hr periods (each ~1.03MB) in Ascii Arcg format totaling approximately 3.11 MB.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2017. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

The dataset is presented by 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) boundaries following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA) publishes GCCSA and Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) breakdowns of the number of debtors with business and non-business related personal insolvencies on a quarterly basis, using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) ASGS.\nExplanatory notes can be found at AFSA Regional Statistics \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAFSA suppressed the data for regions with small numbers of individuals to protect the privacy and confidentiality of insolvent debtors. Whenever necessary to suppress data, cells are nulled. Generally, AFSA publishes data with three or more debtors.\n\n\nRegional personal insolvency activity statistics are reported based on the number of debtors.\n\n\nAURIN has added month and year columns for filtering purposes\n\n",

The cell size is 10 metres.\r\n\r\nProcessing stages included:\r\n\r\n1 Detection of a coastline from a RADARSAT image of Heard Island acquired 24 January 2002 and rectified using ground control points provided by a second contractor.\r\n\r\n2 Generation of the interferometric SAR (InSAR) DEM using the RADARSAT images acquired on 17 February 2002 and 13 March 2002.\r\n\r\n3 Co-registration of the InSAR DEM with a DEM derived from stereoscopic RADARSAT images acquired in March and April of 1997 and described by the metadata record 'Heard Island RADARSAT (1997) DEM'.\r\n\r\n4 Merging of the InSAR DEM with the 1997 stereoscopic DEM and the coastline detected in stage 1.\r\n\r\nThe following are available for download from the Related URLs below:\r\n\r\n1 The final DEM in ArcInfo interchange or ArcInfo ascii formats.\r\n\r\n2 The rectified RADARSAT image of Heard Island acquired 24 January 2002. Rectified using ground control points and subsequently used in processing of the DEM.\r\n\r\n3 Contours generated from the DEM and the island polygon (coastline) extracted from the rectified RADARSAT image acquired 24 January 2002.\r\n\r\n4 A detailed deport describing the generation of the DEM.\r\n\r\n5 A report by\r\n\r\nDr Arko Lucieer\r\n\r\nCentre for Spatial Information Science\r\n\r\nSchool of Geography and Environmental Studies\r\n\r\nUniversity of Tasmania\r\n\r\nPrivate Bag 76\r\n\r\nHobart 7001\r\n\r\nTasmania, Australia\r\n\r\noutlining some errors and artefacts in the DEM.\r\n\r\nDr Lucieer produced this report while working for the Australian Antarctic Division.\r\n\r\nOn 3 July 2003 Henk Brolsma (Mapping Officer, Australian Antarctic Division)  wrote the following email to the contractor who created the DEM. \"What I'm really interested in are the 20 metre contours for the areas with high coherency. These are the areas where most of the field work takes place and where we have a need for contours with an accuracy better than 50 metres and my reason for using INSAR in the first instance. So can you send me: 1. The 20 metre contours for the areas with high coherency? 2. The zone or line where the INSAR and Stereo Imagery were integrated? This would be very useful for the metadata.\" He did not receive a reply to that email and that was the reason why he was reluctant to make the DEM public. Since he won't now get a reply and the DEM is probably better than the 1997 DEM, he considers the 2002 DEM should now be published.",

    "description": "This is a historical data record of the Victorian Wastewater testing program. Data contains results from October 2022.\nTesting of wastewater can show if SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – is present in a geographical area or population.\nVictoria conducts wastewater surveillance and uses testing results with other health data as part of our COVID-19 response.\nPeople who have or have recently had COVID-19 may shed fragments of the virus. These fragments can enter wastewater through toilets, bowls, sinks and drains. This viral shedding may come from different sources such as used tissues, off hands and skin, or in stools. This shedding may last for a number of weeks beyond when a person is infectious.\nSamples of wastewater are collected from treatment plants and in the sewer network, both in metropolitan and regional locations. These samples are analysed for fragments of coronavirus.\nIf viral fragments are detected in the wastewater of an area where there have not been recent COVID-19 cases, local communities can be more vigilant, promptly seek clinical testing if symptomatic, and practise COVID-safe behaviours with increased vigilance.",

    "description": "This policy aims to promote a system in which sustainable land use and transport are mutually compatible.\n\nThe objectives of this policy are to:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nprotect people from unreasonable levels of transport noise by establishing a standardised set of criteria to be used in the assessment of proposals; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nprotect major transport corridors and freight operations from incompatible urban encroachment; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nencourage best-practice design and construction standards for new development proposals and new or redeveloped transport infrastructure proposals; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nfacilitate the development and operation of an efficient freight network; and \nfacilitate the strategic co-location of freight handling facilities.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe purpose of the implementation guidelines is to assist users with the application and implementation of the Western Australian Planning Commission’s state planning policy 5.4.\n\nIt should be noted that the policy and these guidelines apply to proposals for new noise-sensitive developments, new railways or major roads, major redevelopments of existing railways or major roads, and new freight handling facilities. The policy and guidelines do not apply to noise from existing railways or major roads in the vicinity of an existing noise-sensitive land use, or an increase in traffic along an existing railway or major road in the absence of a major redevelopment.\n\nIt is expected that a review of the operation and effectiveness of the policy would be conducted within two years of the commencement of the policy.",

    "title": "Ecological effects of the introduced fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii (Gmelin, 1791), on hard substratum epifaunal assemblages",
    "description": "Sabella spallanzanii is an introduced sabellid ploychaete that is thought to be native to the Mediterranean and east Atlantic coast. Since its first identification in Port Phillip Bay in 1992 it has spread rapidly and occurs in most parts of the bay.  This thesis  examines the ecological impact of Sabella spallanzanii aggregations on hard substrate epifaunal assemblages in south eastern Australia. Specifically the effects of Sabella on: a) recruitment of sessile invertebrates; b) development of epifaunal assemblages; c) distribution of larvae and other planktonic organisms and d) growth and survival of sessile animals are examined.  These effects are evaluated in relation to spatial and temporal changes in Sabella canopies resulting from changes in populations and patterns of fan deployment.  Studies were carried out between 1995 and 1998 at four sites within Port Phillip Bay, Victoria (Geelong Marina, Breakwater Pier, Victoria Dock and St Kilda Marina) and at Outer Harbour, within the Gulf of St Vincent, South Australia.\n\nThe effects of Sabella on recruitment of sessile taxa were complex, but a number of generalisations could be made.  Recruitment of some barnacles, bryozoan, spirorbid and ascidian taxa to large experimentally cleared (pilings) areas was higher than on uncleared areas.  On the scale of individual 20 by 20 cm settlement plates, where the effects of physical structure was controlled using fanworm mimics, most of the effects were caused by the presence of physical structure on the plate.  Positive and negative responses of some taxa were observed but responses were not consistent across experiments.  Recruitment onto  tubes increased the abundance of several taxa on plates with fanworms, but not all taxa recruited onto tubes. Results were not consistent within taxonomic groups or between sites.\n\nLonger term experiments revealed fewer changes to the structure of the understorey assemblage.  The apparent disappearance of canopy effects with time could be caused by processes associated with assemblage development such as overgrowth and  senescence of early recruits. Alternatively it could simply be caused by differences in the composition of assemblages between experiments. \n\nMultivariate analyses showed that spatial variation in recruitment on the scale of 10's of metres was important in determining the composition of the assemblage in both early and later stages.\n\nThe planktonic abundances of larval solitary ascidian, spionid polychaetes and pooled larval taxa adjacent to the substratum were significantly reduced by the presence of a fanworm canopy, suggesting that larval flux to these areas may be lower. Little difference in larval recruitment between cleared and uncleared areas suggests that settlement rates may be enhanced or post-settlement mortality rates might be lower beneath canopies.\n\nGrowth of the arborescent bryozoan Bugula stolonifera and an encrusting bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata were affected by the presence of a canopy, but these effects were not consistent between experiments.  This variability suggests that canopies may act in different ways at different times.\n\nThe overall impact of Sabella spallanzanii on other species at the scales examined in this thesis can not be explained by its modification of the habitat.  The use of tubes as settlement sites, and the  predominance of small scale responses to physical structure support this idea.  Any impact of Sabella spallanzanii must also be evaluated in the light of observations that the canopy was not constant though time, due to population crashes that occurred at a number of times and places.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2).

    "description": "On the Australian margin, submarine canyons have formed along all sides of the continent and are exposed to the potential influence of large-scale ocean currents, including the Leeuwin Current and the East Australian Current. Recognised in marine bioregional plans as potential biodiversity hotspots, many of these canyons sit within the new national network of Commonwealth Marine Reserves. This GIS polygon layer contains 753 submarine canyons along the Australian continental margin and external territories. The locations and extents of these canyons were derived from a range of bathymetry datasets. The layer has attributes describing the canyon's shape, morphometric and geographic characteristics. The definitions are as follows.

The other HF ocean radar station is at Lady Elliot Island.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe TAN HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 12-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 45 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 47 deg true east of north (approximately north-east).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.\n\nThis station was decommissioned in April 2017.",

The primary compartment boundaries for WA were determined by identifying major changes in rock type along the coast and changes in shoreline orientation, while incorporating complete landforms of coastal significance. The Primary compartments have been subdivided into secondary compartments based on landform associations. This dataset was commissioned by the Department of Planning and compiled by Damara Pty Ltd and the Geological Society of WA. A full report was also prepared to accompany the dataset, published August 2011. Some superficial changes have been made to the dataset since publication of the report in order to amalgamate the data into a nationwide compartment dataset developed by Geoscience Australia.",

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP3, a 6m steel pole, which has been installed within a small bommie in Third Lagoon on One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions. \n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on One Tree Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on Heron Island (near by), Orpheus Island (central GBR) and Lizard Island (northen GBR). A light sensor is also located on the island itself to give measures of PAR.",

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nThe data only includes a small number of mothers aged less than 15.\n\n\nDenominators are based on the estimated resident population of females aged 15-19 by state and territory and PHN.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Tennant Creek for 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "title": "Wild Rivers (DWER-087)",
    "description": "Wild Rivers are rivers that are largely unchanged natural systems, where biological and hydrological processes continue without significant disturbance. They occur in a variety of landscapes, and may be permanent, seasonal or dry watercourses that flow or only flow occasionally, (Water and Rivers Commission, 1999). Wild Rivers are considered to be of high value because of their rarity, biodiversity or habitats, water quality and scientific value as benchmarks of natural catchment conditions. They remain generally undisturbed due to their isolation, rugged topography or land tenure.\n\nThrough a project with the Australian Heritage Commission, the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (then Water and Rivers Commission) originally identified 49 wild rivers catchments in Western Australia. New development and continuing pressures, such as grazing, tourism/recreation, and invasion by non-endemic species, have the potential to degrade wild rivers over time. Since initial identification, the Upper Yule River has been downgraded, due to development in the catchment. Western Australia currently has 48 wild rivers, of which 37 are located in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions. See Water Note 37: Wild rivers in Western Australia (https://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2023-03/Water-note-37-Wild-rivers-in-Western-Australia.pdf). \n\nWild river catchments classified as Priority 1 (P1) or Priority 2 (P2) are both considered to be of high value and are generally managed the same way, because there are nominal differences between the classifications. P1 wild rivers are those with no or minor impact from clearing, altering the landscape, loss of vegetation due to grazing, road or track construction, introduced exotic animals, plants or plant diseases, increased fire frequency, unnatural erosion and sedimentation or alterations to waterway and riparian ecosystem. P2 wild rivers are those with some but not extensive impacts from the activities or processes listed above. Since their initial identification, the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation has not undertaken a programme to monitor the condition of wild rivers catchments.\n\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation advises that activities in wild rivers catchments should be managed so they do not adversely impact on values, including water quantity and quality. Conservation guidelines for the management of wild rivers: Part C - A Code for the Management of Wild Rivers (Australian Heritage Commission, 1998) provides management principles. ",

Reporting transfer certificates allow National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting obligations to transfer from a controlling corporation with operational control over the facility to the corporation that has financial control over the facility. \r\n\r\nThis extract reflects a point-in-time picture of Australia’s corporate emissions and energy use in 2014-15 and is subject to change based on ongoing regulation of compliance.\r\n\r\nPlease click on \"Go to resource\" or follow the URL to view the dataset.",

The survey collected video using a lightweight towed camera system, as well as footage from a camera mounted on the Smith-MacIntyre sediment grab. Bathymetry data was collected using GA's EM3002 system running in single head mode.\n\nThe aims of the survey were to characterize benthic habitat in the Flinders Commonwealth Marine Reserve using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) sample design.\n\nThe camera files are organized according to date collected and are labelled using the camera shot number and GRTS sample number.",

The register offers, for the first time, the opportunity to recognize, celebrate and protect the exceptional trees that exist on private and public land in our city. The Exceptional Tree Register is a compilation of reports on trees that have been nominated by the community, organizations, property managers, staff and tree owners. The trees were assessed by qualified arborists and an expert panel reviewed and recommended these trees for inclusion in the register.\nAcknowledgements\nThe City of Ballarat would like to acknowledge that these exceptional trees grow on the traditional land of the Wadawurrung People.\nWe would like to thank all individuals who nominated trees and raised the profile of this register. Their efforts allowed us to find the exceptional trees that we celebrate here.\nWe would like to thank the owners and managing authorities of the properties that the trees are on for their assistance in this process and for being custodians of such important assets in our urban forest.\nWe would also like to thank our experts who made up our selection panel for their time and effort.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NW section of Jervis Bay (35.03S, 150.7E) between 6/12/88 and 11/1/89. This mooring held two water current metres: an S4 Interocean current meter at a depth of 5.5m, and an Aanderaa (RCM7) meter at a depth of 9.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided in the datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nThe Aanderaa meter at 9.5m should have provided eastern and northern tidal components over the duration of the sampling period, however the compass jammed and did not work at all. Water speed was recorded but gives no indication of the direction of water movement.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 9.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2004 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "This dataset shows the distribution of fresh and saline water 10 m below the water table in the Superficial aquifer, in the Esperance groundwater area. Salinity categories are not defined further than 6,000 mg/L which has been used to represent the saltwater interface. \n\nThis dataset is a derived location based on an assessment of data for the period November 2020 to November 2021. The 2016 Interpretation of TEMPEST Airbourne Electromagnetic Data from Esperance (Mira Geoscience) was also used in creating this dataset. This location can change pending known factors that impact the location of the seawater interface including the time of year, tidal movements, abstraction, recharge and throughflow.  \n\nThe full assessment of the SWI in this area is documented in report HR437 Esperance Seawater Interface Priority Area Assessment. \n\nThis dataset is sourced from the Statewide Seawater Interface Project, funded by the Government of Western Australia under the State Groundwater Investigation Program. \n\nIn the Esperance area, the project runs from April 2020 to March 2023 and the data are collected from: \n- Seawater interface monitoring (SWIM) bores installed or owned by the department\n- Downhole natural gamma and induction logging\n- Installation of data loggers and continuous static groundwater level (SWL) measurements from data loggers\n- Electrical conductivity (EC) depth profiling\n- Groundwater chemistry sampling.\n- Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey.\nThe above data that is owned by the department can be downloaded from the Water Information Reporting (WIR) Portal or by contacting the Department. AEM survey data can be downloaded via the interactive geological map tool GeoVIEW.WA from the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety. \nInformation on the SWI project can be found on the Western Australia State Government website (www.wa.gov.au).",
