    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who were admitted to any hospital in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to the leading causes of death by sex. The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Local Government Area (LGA) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any LGA with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 6. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Tenure of Australia's forests (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\n*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of\r\nnational land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests\r\nReport 2018*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory\r\ngovernment agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then\r\ncombined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of\r\nAustralia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for\r\napplication to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature\r\nconservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved\r\ntenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

This is time series data from water quality and seafood industry monitoring programs. As such this is a good resource for monitoring the occurrences of harmful algal bloom (HAB) and nuisance species in Australian coastal waters. Whilst this collection documents the abundances of HAB taxa, it can not be used to confirm the presence of any toxin. Most of the data are considered near shore or estuarine. The data are given in cells per litre of water for abundances, although some taxa are marked as present if they were seen in a sample but not in the formal count. Each verifiable taxon has been assigned an Aphia_id from the World Register of Marine Species website (WoRMS) where the full taxonomy of that entity can be found. If the Aphia_id is missing then the taxon name is not currently recognised by WoRMS.\nData have been contributed by:\nHornsby Council NSW &amp; Microalgal solutions\nNSW Food Authority &amp; Microalgal solutions\nTasmanian EPA &amp; Analytical Services Tasmania (AST)",

    "description": "Colonial waterbird breeding colonies monitored in two Selected Areas of the CEWH’s Flow-MER program (the Murrumbidgee river system and Lachlan river system).  These are overall statistics of the colony size (nests/individuals) and start and end dates with estimated breeding success for colonies where detailed nest observations are conducted.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWO (2024) Waterbird Diversity.

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

The field books have been scanned as PDF files with the original field books being currently stored at the Archives Office. \nIndex and field books are currently only relevant to the â¿Southern Districtâ¿ of Forestry Tasmania. This district extended north to Great Lake/Fingal Valley &amp; West to the South West Conservation Area.\nThe Field books are generally indexed by 7 number digit (eg 4627-005).\no   First 4 digits reference the 25k topographical map tile relevant to the job locality.\no   Last 3 digits represent a sequential job number.\nIn the majority of instances the Index polylines have been digitized over the existing Cadastral boundary layers which may not necessarily be representative of the actual boundary determination described in the field book. Attributes of the Forestry Field Book Index include the MapNo (25k map tile), SurveyNo (3 digit sequential job number), date of survey and type of boundary marking (painted, flagged, cleared or none). The notes attribute may also describe the method of survey (GPS, total station, compass and type). The attribute information shown is only as accurate as that detailed on the face of the field book.\nThe indexed boundaries shown are relevant as at the date of survey. Subsequent land dealings following the surveys shown may have resulted in changes in boundary locations.",

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nThe data only includes a small number of mothers aged less than 15.\n\n\nDenominators are based on the estimated resident population of females aged 15-19 by state and territory and PHN.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

The data spans the months from January 2020 to June 2021 and includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "The lesser hairy­footed dunnart (<i>Sminthopsis youngsoni, Dasyuridae</i>) is a generalist marsupial insectivore in arid Australia, but consumes wolf spiders (<i>Lycosa spp., Lycosidae</i>) disproportionately often relative to their availability. This project tested the hypothesis that this disproportionate predation is a product of frequent encounter rates between the interactants due to high overlap in their diets and use of space and time. This data set focuses on overlap in the use of different microhabitats of wolf spiders (<i>Lycosa spp.</i>) and the lesser hairy­footed dunnart (<i>Sminthopsis youngsoni</i>) in the Simpson Desert, south­western Queensland Australia. Microhabitat use was determined by estimating the percentage cover of seven microhabitat variables and distance to nearest cover along trails left by individuals of each species­ group and a randomly orientated (control) trail for each actual trail as a measure of the availability of each microhabitat within the local environment. Trail length was also recorded and data was collected across 16 trapping grids at Main Camp during July and October (winter and Spring) in 2017. Differences in microhabitat use between trail types (actual vs control) and species (lycosids vs dunnarts) were assessed using non­metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutational analyses of variance (PERMANOVA). These analyses were performed using this data.",

    "description": "    \n\nDefinition: Mean annual dissolved concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil\nwater (mg of nitrogen per kg of water), averaged for both soil layers.\nInterpretation: The dissolved N concentration is calculated as the ratio of\nthe mineral N store to soil water store, which assumes that all the mineral N\nis in solution. Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these\nstores, but not on their ratio. The pattern of mineral N concentrations is\nexplained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N\nstore (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air\ndryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy\nlimitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that\ndecreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-\narid tropical environments. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes (1) current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation; (2) current agricultural inputs of nutrients\n(nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertiliser, legume crops, and legume pastures;\n(3) current nutrient offtakes by product removal (harvest, stock).\nNMnlConc0.Agric a Mean annual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water\n(mgN kgH2O-1) in the aAgrica (present day) scenario NMnlConc0.Base a Mean\nannual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water (mgN kgH2O-1) in the\naBasea (pre-1788) scenario Data is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_cmnswr9cl\n__02811a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The museum’s collection dates back to 1854 and comprises natural sciences (including zoological, palaeontological, and geological specimens) and humanities (including indigenous cultures, history and technology collections). The museum cares for an estimated 17 million items, many of which are grouped together as a single entry in the electronic cataloguing system. \nThe MV Collections website provides access to over 1.15 million records, representing items in the Humanities collection; specimens in the Sciences collection; articles written about significant people, places and parts of the collection; and species profiles written about animals that can be observed in the wild. A search may deliver results across items, species, specimens or article records. Results can be refined by adding a new search term to the existing query, or by using the supplied filters.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2008.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Ferry Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2021",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "The EAC5 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.1 S, 155.3 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015.  \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

    "description": "The Higher School Certificate is the highest educational award in secondary education in NSW. It is awarded to students who have satisfactorily completed Years 11 and 12 at secondary school. To be eligible, students must meet HSC course requirements and sit for the statewide HSC examinations. \nNotes:  \n\n\nPrior to 2016, this dataset used data from the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA). From 2016 onwards, data presented is based on Aboriginal status reported in the National Schools Statistics Collection (NSSC) conducted each August.\n\n\nHSC Record of Achievement includes those students awarded the HSC and who have completed one or more HSC courses but have not yet been awarded the HSC. \n\n\nHSC Record of Achievement includes students who participated in HSC pathways. \n\n\nHSC pathways offer a flexible program for students to complete the HSC over a period of up to five years. The pathways provisions include accumulating courses, repeating courses, acceleration, recognition of prior learning, and combining study with part-time traineeships or apprenticeships.\n\n\nBradfield college is included.\n\n\nData derived from NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) data, provided in February each year. \n\n\nSource: \n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "Tropical rainforests play a powerful role in mediating the global climate through the exchange and storage of carbon and water.  Climate change is expected to generate higher atmospheric water demand in many areas, potentially increasing the rate of evaporation.  In this study, we show that higher evaporative demand may in fact lead to lower fluxes of water from tropical rainforests and a reduced capacity of these forests to store carbon.\n\nThe record contains meteorological and forest inventory data in addition to data on soil water potential, sapflow measurements and tree hydraulic vulnerability measures from Robson Creek and Cow Bay study sites in Far North Queensland. The measurements occurred over a period of two years form 2019 to 2020.",

These surveys will\ninform coastal modelling currently being undertaken as part of coastal design projects and may also\nbe used to set-out coastal protection structures such as groyne extensions and seawalls encroaching\nbelow the low tide mark. \n\nThe survey requirements were to provide enough coverage within marked survey extents and high\npriority areas for each site to capture key bed features and the toe of any coastal structures up to\n-0.5m AHD. Additionally, the fringes of reefs within the marked areas were to be captured. To\nsupplement this data, a number of survey profiles were specified for capture. The survey to be carried\nout to Class D requirements.\n\nThis site, Woody Point, refers to a 2.2km x 0.6km long section of coastline on the southern tip of the\nRedcliffe Peninsula and incorporates the Woody Point jetty. The survey area as identified through the\nspecifications, including profiles, is contained within an area of 1.9km by 1.6km.",

This includes each compulsory and elective English class for secondary students held during the week of the census. Secondary students not studying English are NOT counted in the class size return.

Excluded are classes such as English Literature, Remedial English or ESL that a student attends as well as “compulsory” English.

The project includes:\n<ul><li>a new web portal to make it easier for the community to report wombats to capture where in the landscape healthy and unhealthy populations of wombats are occurring and so wildlife volunteers can quickly assess treatment options available.(please contact access Canberra for wildlife injured on our roads requiring immediate attention)</li><li>a new spatial support tool that maps wombat populations to help us understand the extent of mange and its effects on populations and to facilitate coordinated monitoring and treatment</li><li>an innovative research effort that will trial the remote delivery of a more effective and longer lasting mange treatment ACT Wildlife and Wombat Rescue are partnering with government on the project in an excellent example of how government and community volunteers can work together for good outcomes for a species in trouble. The University of Tasmania is providing advice from its own research and trials.</li></ul>\n\nThe wombat mange project progresses a commitment under the Parliamentary Agreement of the 10th Legislative Assembly to fund ACT Wildlife to undertake mange treatment in the ACT. Collaboratively, the ACT Government and community volunteers will deliver a coordinated and comprehensive mange treatment program across the ACT.\n\nThe project is part of a wider wombat management project being developed within ACT Government.

    "description": "This dataset and accompanying RMarkdown notebook document the analysis and efforts to consolidate spatial data on coastal protection structures, such as sea walls, groynes, and wharfs, across Australia's coastline. The project addresses the urgent need for a national-level dataset by sourcing data from various state governments and identifying gaps in coverage. The dataset integrates contributions from OpenStreetMap (OSM), Smartline, and state-based government databases, resulting in a research-quality geospatial file. Key attributes include the location and type of coastal structures, with data standardised for consistency across regions. Limitations are noted, such as the absence of government-supplied data for certain regions and potential accuracy issues with OSM-sourced information. The dataset is intended for research purposes, supporting efforts to assess coastal risks and guide future protection measures. Ongoing updates to datasets will extend to not only consider engineered hard structures but also include datasets of nature-based coastal protection (e.g., restored reefs and coastal vegetation).",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2020 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

The data were obtained from XBTs (expendable bathythermographs) deployed via merchant vessels, and are now managed by the Joint Australian Facility for Ocean Observing Systems (JAFOOS), a collaborative venture between CSIRO Marine Research and the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC).",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "All government primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have school zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas).\nSchool zones were produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nSchool zones defined as metropolitan have taken preference over school zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of school zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some school zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website.\nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

    "description": "This dataset is a subset of the Sedimentary Basins dataset developed by Geoscience Australia. It represents those sedimentary basins in the North commonwealth marine planning region that are considered to be prospective for petroleum, and it has been attributed with a rating describing the relative prospectivity of different areas. This interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity is derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins. The classification terms used represent a simplified qualitative assessment of petroleum prospectivity, and are subject to future change as new data are gathered and interpreted.\n\nThe information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the North marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe Sedimentary Basins dataset itself provides outlines for the maximum extent of Australian geological provinces and their components, including sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic provinces, both onshore and offshore.  These data were compiled as part of Geoscience Australia's integrated digital information system to provide improved accessibility and knowledge relating to the petroleum and minerals geology and prospectivity, and to provide a national stratigraphic and tectonic framework for Australia.  The current Sedimentary Basins dataset is not complete for Australia, and covers only offshore sedimentary provinces and a selection of sedimentary and igneous provinces in onshore eastern Australia.The information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the North marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe following caveat applies to the use of the data in any mapping products:\n'The interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity are derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins.

Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes the central part of the suburb of Picnic\nPoint. The northern part of the catchment is predominantly urban; the southern part includes parts of\nthe Georges River National Park, in particular the Yeramba Lagoon. The catchment drains gradually\nsouth, through a stormwater pipe network towards the Georges River. The Sydney South Electricity\nSubstation is also located within the Picnic Point catchment. The Picnic Point catchment is wholly\nwithin the southern section of Bankstown City Council Local Government Area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 170 stormwater pits and 200 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Picnic Point Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

    "description": "Remotely sensed topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) information were acquired for targeted sections of the NSW mid-north coast using Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB - a combination of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) sensors) during November - December 2013. This resource defines total area of 139 km2 of data covering areas around the locations of 1) Lake Cathie and 2) Old Bar. Data were acquired by Pelydryn Ltd on behalf of NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (now the Department of Planning and Environment) using a HawkEye IIb bathymetric LiDAR system aboard VH-CWG Aircraft. Funding was provided through NSW Office of Environment and Heritage to acquire high-quality, high-resolution baseline data to support coastal erosion studies. The survey requirement was to provide high-resolution data at a minimum of 5 x 5 m laser spot spacings from the mean high-water mark to ~200m inland, and from the shore, seaward (LADS - bathymetry) up to maximum ~5km offshore (~20-40m water depth depending on in-water conditions). Positioning data were collected on the ellipsoid ITRF 2014 GRS80 in UTM Z56 and post-processed using local base stations (CORSnet NSW) to provide a Post Processed Kinematic GNSS solution for final aircraft trajectory before being applied to all data. Data types available are as GeoTiff (L3) or classified LAS format point cloud (L2) issued transformed to GDA94 Z56. Other data types may be available as ESRI topo-bathy rasters and contours, tab delimited ascii XYZ, unclassified LAS format data, relative reflectance data (terrestrial, marine) and Quality Control (QC) documentation (contained within survey report) via the NSW DPE Information Asset Register (IAR) (metadata, coverage shape), SEED (https://seed.nsw.gov.au or upon request.  Users note: these surveys achieved maximum depths of ~15m and some artefacts may be apparent in the nearshore potentially associated with in-water conditions (i.e. algae; turbidity). The data are intended to inform coastal and marine management and are ‘not for navigation’.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council monitors the quality of waterways to ensure the public is not exposed to unnecessary health risk. Council monitors the water quality at 11 sites in the Brisbane River and sections of Moreton Bay, which have high rates of recreational use. The datasets derived from the monitoring are published and warning signs are put in place where required.\n\nInformation on water quality monitoring can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/environment-and-water/water-and-air-quality/water-quality-monitoring\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.\n\nThis dataset consists of the level of microbial contamination within Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. Brisbane City Council monitors of enterococci bi-monthly in summer and monthly during the cooler winter months. The presence of high levels of enterococci can vary daily, and may be elevated after heavy rainfall. Enterococci exposure can contribute to increased health risk and primary contact should be avoided.\n\nThe Data and resources section of this dataset contains further information for this dataset.",

    "description": "Data showing estimated lime application in Western Australia to treat acidifying soils, 2004-2016. Estimates are based on agricultural lime sales in WA (as supplied by Lime WA Inc).\r\n\r\nThe data shows the rate of lime use has continued to increase substantially in WA following consistent and sustained Research, Development and Extension projects promoting better management of soil acidity.\r\n\r\nNote: This data represents the aggregate agricultural lime sales figures for each year for the 2016 Lime WA members. The data demonstrates the WA trend (and is not an absolute figure of lime used per year in WA). Because the number of members changes overtime these figures, which have been restricted to current members, differ from those previously published. It is estimated that these current members represent approximately 80 percent of the total market share. \r\n\r\nFor related background information see: https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sites/gateway/files/Report%20card%20on%20sustainable%20natural%20resource%20use%20in%20agriculture%20-%20full%20report%20-%2025MB.pdf\r\n\r\nThe data has been used by the Department of Environment and Energy to produce Figure LAN18 in the Land theme of Australia State of the Environment 2016, available at \r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/land/topic/2016/soil-salinity-and-acidification#land-figure-LAN18\r\n",

Important results published in our 53-page Phys. Rev. X paper (2021) include the first measurements of higher-order light-propagation effects and of the relativistic deformation of the orbit and highlight the importance of a long term observational campaign, including VLBI observations, for this remarkable system. The main aims of this proposal are to provide the strongest tests to date for general relativity and to measure for the first time the moment-of-inertia of a neutron star. Additionally, we will determine the system geometry, map the pulsar beams via geodetic precession, and search for the reappearance of Pulsar B. We exploit the high sensitivity and broad bandwidth of the UWL receiver. We are collaborating with the MeerKAT Double Pulsar Timing team to optimise combination of MeerKAT and UWL data.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded.

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe Pre-1996 bores and wells data shows point location of the monitoring bores that were installed prior to 1996.\nAccuracy: Points of original shapefile data were been recorded based on data collected from hand drawn maps and reports and local knowledge. Two sites WB 72 and WB73 were located by way of x and y coordinates supplied by GPS survey. Site WB 30 was located by local knowledge of the sites. Location of bores should fall within accuracy ± 20m.\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.  \n\nEach mooring is equipped with surface CO2 systems, using proven and robust technology.  Three sensors will determine surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. \n\nAcidification moorings are co-located at three National Reference Stations:\n* the Yongala NRS in Queensland (replaced in September 2013 after Tropical Cyclone Yasi) (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and a WETLabs WQM)\n* the Maria Island NRS in Tasmania (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT), and\n* the Kangaroo Island NRS in South Australia (removed in June 2013, and redeployed in May 2014) (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT).  \n\nA fourth acidification mooring is located adjacent to the Heron Island reef slope in the Wistari channel on the Great Barrier Reef (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT).  \n\nThe Yongala, Wistari and Maria Island acidification moorings are located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean.  The Kangaroo Island mooring monitors the deeper waters upwelled on the South Australian shelf which are expected to have higher CO2 and thus could accelerate the exposure of ecosystems to acidification earlier than in other regions.",

Contract Notice Export\nfiles remain available on AusTender for a period of eighteen (18) months.\n\nYou can find the historical contract data dating back to 1999 at\n[http://data.gov.au/dataset/historical-australian-government-contract-\ndata/](http://data.gov.au/dataset/historical-australian-government-contract-\ndata/)\n\n**Please note that the data contained within each CN Export file is correct at the time of extraction. Data may change over time as agencies undertake data quality assurance processes or as contract information is varied. Please refer to the tenders website below for the latest of each week.**\n\n**Note: **As part of the implementation of the new Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs), Procurement Method descriptions for Contract and Standing Offer Notices reported on AusTender changed, effective 1 July 2012. Open, Select and Direct are now Open Tender, Prequalified Tender, and Limited Tender, respectively. For Contract Notice Export files extracted prior to 1 July 2012, Procurement Method descriptions are unchanged.\n\nSource of information at [http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.lis\ntCNWeeklyExport](http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.listCNWeeklyE\nxport)\n\n**UPDATE:** Now below is also the current list of goods and services category codes used by Australian Government agencies to code their open approaches to market and contracts awarded for publication on AusTender. The codeset is a subset of the United Nations Standard Product and Services Code (UNSPSC) and is reviewed and updated periodically. Code numbers starting with the prefixes **43 a Information Technology, Broadcasting and Telecommunications** and **81 a Engineering and Research and Technology Based Services** apply in the main to Information and Communications Technology related contracts, primarily ICT goods and services respectively.\n\n_Please note: we will make an API available to this dataset in the near\nfuture_.\n\n",
