    "title": "Surveys of deep water benthic communities using towed video in Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia (WAMSI Node 3 Project 1 Subproject 3.1.1)",
    "description": "A total of 365 towed video transects were completed in the 2006/2007 surveys. The sampling has identified a vast array of habitats and will be used for broad scale mapping of benthic communities in the marine park, however further transect tows will be conducted in 2008 in areas of special interest, where sampling is considered limited and where ground-truthing is required. Towed video sampling effort was concentrated around Mandu, Osprey, Yardie, Winderabandi and Point Cloates in 2006. In 2007, to ensure adequate sampling effort throughout the marine park, sampling was stratified at 5 km intervals from Point Murat to Red Bluff conducting 3-4 transects from the back of the reef out to the seaward marine park boundary at each point. \nTowed video allows for the visualisation of the range of benthic communities occurring within the marine park, ground truthing of areas with significant bathymetric and textural properties and provides detailed information on the variability in diversity, abundance and biomass of all the different communities. \nVisual imagery of the benthos was captured using a 1/3 inch single CCD colour video camera mounted on a Para vane and controlled by a winch with 320m of electromechanical cable. Two 12 volt, 35 watt underwater lights illuminated the field of view. The video signal was recorded on a shipboard miniDV tape recorder. In addition to the visual imagery the miniDV tape recorder received GPS data (latitude and longitude, ground speed, true heading, date and time), which was recorded on the audio track. A computer-based application (TowVid), developed by AIMS (Speare et al. 2004), allows for real-time touch-screen classification of substrata, benthos and individual organisms interfaced with a GPS to facilitate real-time geo-referencing of all data points. C-MapTM vector charts and MaxseaTM electronic navigation software were used to record the ship's track and water depth. Data points were recorded at 8-second intervals or on demand when a new substrate, benthos or organism was recorded on TowVid. An average speed of 1.5 knots was achieved over the Towed Video surveys equating to a horizontal resolution of 6m.",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "title": "WAMSI 2 – Kimberley Node – Project 2.2.6 - Terrestrial-Ocean Linkages: The role of rivers and estuaries in sustaining marine productivity in the Kimberley",
    "description": "Terrestrial landscapes and coastal marine environments are linked by the rivers that flow between them. This is particularly true in the Kimberley, where each year large amounts of freshwater enter coastal waters. This project aimed to understand how dissolved and particulate material from freshwater systems in the Kimberley are transported by the tides and currents into the coastal marine environment and whether these exports from land play a role in coastal productivity. The project linked closely with WAMSI 2 KMRP projects 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 to better understand how freshwater discharge influences marine food web structure and sustains the productivity of Kimberley inshore ecosystems.\nOceanographic and biogeochemical data was collected over two field campaigns (October/November 2013 and April/May 2014) from the Walcott Inlet, Collier Bay area (16° 22.624’S 124° 26.235’E to 16° 24.487’S 124° 54.035’E) and models integrated with those for Collier Bay (KMRP Project 2.2.2). The hydrology component focussed on catchments flowing into Walcott Inlet and Collier Bay, but climate projections and stream flow data analysed for whole of Kimberley. Chemical data to apportion sources of organic matter was also collected. This data was used to support development of the biogeochemical model. No primary data was collected in the hydrology component, but major data sets were collated, including data from 88 streamflow gauging stations managed by the Department of Water.\nA coupled physical-biogeochemical model and a catchment carbon export model was developed to understand the link between exported material and coastal productivity and has been an important component of the research project as it has allowed estimates of freshwater flow under current and future climate scenarios and an estimate of export of nutrients (carbon and nitrogen) and the forms in which they exist. Historical data used from 1961 to 2012 was used for calibration of the model, and future simulations were run for the period 2013 – 2064.\nThis metadata record only relates to data either collected or generated by CSIRO. For data held by other project partners, please refer to the ‘supplementary information’ section.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "    \n\nThis data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment.aDesignated irrigation\nareasa indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\nThe precise meaning of the term adesignated irrigation areaa varies from\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\nsource material is highly variable and completedness of coverage is poor in\nsome regions.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\n__00211a01.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This polygon dataset shows the position and names of Recreational Areas within the State of Queensland. Recreational areas include: - civic Squares, gardens, golf gourses, miscellaneous areas (e.g. basketball courts, bowling clubs, caravan parks, netball courts, tennis courts, velodromes , ovals, parks, race courses, racetracks, rifle Ranges, showgrounds, zoos). This purpose of this dataset is to provide the position and names of Recreational Areas for use in Land Administration,Topographic Mapping and in the production of Navigational and Web Based Mapping applications. Additional Information: This data has been compiled from numerous sources to produce a state wide coverage with the boundaries aligned in most cases with the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB)or captured from the best available imagery with an attribute within the data describing the source and reliability. Source data include: Queensland digital cadastral database, Queensland regional mapping, Queensland orthophotography, satellite imagery, Geoscience Australia, community and government websites. The horizontal positional accuracy of the data that has been used to compile this dataset is as follows: Orthophotography +/- 1m, Satellite Imagery +/- 2.5m. The horizontal positional accuracy of DCDB is dependent on the accuracy of the DCDB at the time of extraction.Initially for whole of state data capture, the location of the features was sourced from existing government topographic maps, regional maps and photogrammetric data. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where necessary. The location and names of parks were extracted from the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB). The data had been loaded into the DCDB from a \"Park and Canal Name Attribute Project\" commenced in September 1999 for data acquisition for PSMA. For golf courses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Golf Union Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For rifle ranges, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Rifle Association Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For racecourses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Racing Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. Features for ongoing data capture are sourced from government and community websites and National Park maps and their location is digitized from current orthophotography and satellite imagery. Additional data is supplied by Geoscience Australia as part of their 25K large scale data capture and commitment to the National Topographic Information Coordination Initiative (NTICI). In most cases these features have been identified through fieldwork by Geoscience Australia staff. ",

Data prior to that date were submitted to the RBA.\n\nPrior to March 2002, banks reported to APR on the _Impaired Assets Return_.\nFrom that date, banks report quarterly on _ARF 220.0: Impaired Assets_.\n\naConsolidated groupa, for a locally incorporated bank, refers to the global\noperations of the bank and its subsidiaries, excluding those involved in\ninsurance, funds management/trustee and non-financial business. For a foreign\nbank authorised to operate in Australia as a branch, the data relate to the\noperations of the branch only.\n\naTotal assetsa includes the total on-balance sheet assets reported to APR by\nlocally incorporated banks for capital adequacy purposes, and the assets of\nthe Australian bank operations of foreign bank branches.\n\naImpaired assetsa refers to the aggregate of a reporting bankas non-accrual\nand restructured exposures, both on- and off-balance sheet, plus any assets\nacquired through the enforcement of security conditions. Off-balance sheet\nexposures include, _inter alia_, commitments to provide funds that cannot be\ncancelled or revoked and the credit equivalent amounts of interest rate,\nforeign exchange and other market-related instruments.\n\naNon-accrual itemsa refers to exposures on which income may no longer be\naccrued ahead of its receipt because there is doubt about the ultimate\ncollectibility of principal and/or interest. Included are facilities where\ncontractual payments of principal and/or interest are 90 or more days in\narrears (or which have remained continuously outside approved limits for 90 or\nmore days) and the associated security is insufficient to cover payment of\nprincipal and accrued interest.\n\naRestructured itemsa refers to exposures, not classified as non-accrual, where\nthe original contractual terms have been modified to provide for concessions\nof interest or principal, for reasons related to customersa financial\ndifficulties, which render the facilities anon-commerciala to the bank.\n\naOther real estate owneda (OREO) refers to real estate acquired through\nsecurity enforcement or otherwise as settlement for outstanding obligations.\nExcluded are properties controlled under amortgagee in possessiona rights.\n\naOther assets acquireda refers to all other assets acquired through security\nenforcement or otherwise as settlement for outstanding obligations.\n\naWrite-offsa refers to the aggregate value of items written off against\nprovisions or profits during the period.\n\naPast-due itemsa refers to items that are 90 or more days in arrears but are\nwell secured and have no provisions held against them.

    "description": "A round 1.4m yellow buoy has been deployed in the western part of the main lagoon of Lizard Island to the south of the research station.\n\nThe buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station) a surface mounted (60cm under the water surface) thermistor and an inductive modem to support a range of inductive sensors, initially this will be a SeaBird SBE39 measuring temperature and pressure (depth) and a SeaBird SBE37 measuring conductivity (salinity), temperature and pressure (depth).\n\nAs of August 2010 the inductive sensors are located along a 50m cable that runs north into the main lagoon with a SBE39 located at the base of the buoy and the 37 at the end of the sensor run.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.21) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\n The flux station is located within an area of dryland agriculture. The surrounding area is dominated by broadacre farming practices. The vegetation cover is predominantly pasture. Elevation of the site is close to 330&nbsp;m. Climate information comes from the nearby Pingelly BoM AWS station 010626 (1991 to 2016) and shows mean annual precipitation is approximately 445&nbsp;mm with highest rainfall in June and July of 81&nbsp;mm each month. Maximumum and minuimum annual rainfall is 775 and 217&nbsp;mm, respectively. Maximum temperatures range from 31.9&nbsp;°C (in Jan) to 15.4&nbsp;°C (in July), while minimum temperatures range from 5.5&nbsp;°C (in July) to 16.0&nbsp;°C (in Feb).",

    "description": "Areas within NSW where naturally occurring asbestos has been found, or has the potential to be found within 10 metres of the surface. The areas are based on the existing 1:250,000 geological mapping with additional use of 1:25 000 lithological mapping in the Broken Hill area. The datasets also include point data information on sites where naturally occurring asbestos has been found, and petrographic information on asbestos and its host rocks. The different dataset layers can be switched on or off (and their transparency adjusted) by clicking the 'Layers' icon at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on a polygon or point will return more detailed attribute information. The map has been restricted to only zoom to approximately 1:80,000, reflecting the maximum accuracy of the underlying mapping data.

    "description": "This dataset consists of 546 records of vertebrate species across various sites in the rainforests and adjacent habitats of the Wet Tropics and the Eungella region. Surveys particularly targeted threatened frogs and focussed on ecotonal and peripheral rainforest areas. Each record consists of the date, species, locality name, latitude and longitude, habitat, and observer.\n\nThis is all original data, collected in the field by the listed observers. Surveys particularly targeted threatened frogs but other vertebrates recorded at that site are also included. Surveys focussed on ecotonal and peripheral rainforest areas, but core rainforest sites are also included. Each record consists of the date, species, locality name, latitude and longitude, habitat, and observer. All identifications were made by myself (Conrad Hoskin), an expert in rainforest vertebrate identification.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nSurveys were conducted at sites in the Wet Tropics and in the Eungella region (west of Mackay). Surveys focussed on ecotonal areas on the western side of the Wet Tropics and Eungella, and also peripheral rainforest areas to the north, south and west of these rainforest blocks. These areas were surveyed in order to survey habitats that are environmentally different to the core rainforest areas in the hope of discovering surviving populations of threatened frogs and other wildlife, and also, potentially, new species. The objective was also to survey these environmentally different areas for chytrid presence on frogs.\n\nAt each site a survey typically consisted of one afternoon and evening. Survey effort was two people on foot searching a stream and associated habitat. In the afternoon the effort was focussed on birds and reptiles and then at night the survey focussed on frogs and mammals. Surveys were conducted with binoculars head-torches and head-torches. Surveys were conducted around a focal point and records are typically clustered around this GPS point in the table. All identifications were made by myself (Conrad Hoskin), an expert in the identification of rainforest vertebrates. Each record consists of the date, species, locality name, latitude and longitude, habitat, and observer. Abundances were not estimated.\n\n\nLimitations:\n\nThis list is not an exhaustive survey of vertebrates for these sites. The focus of the surveys was frogs and these were surveyed in detail. The records of additional taxa (reptiles, birds and mammals) were opportunistic. All surveys were on foot and by hand, with no trapping. Surveys were short (one night) because that is typically all the time required to fairly accurately survey frogs at a site. GPS points listed are typically clustered around a focal survey point. They are nonetheless fairly accurate (i.e., the individual record would have come from within about 200 m of the point listed). These are just sight records; abundances were not estimated.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nNERP_eAtlas_data_1 June 2014_Conrad_Hoskin.xlsx (69 KB):\n\n546 records (rows), with the following information for each record (7 columns): date, species, locality name, latitude, longitude, habitat, and observer.\n\nWT_NERP-TE-3-3_Vertebrate-survey_2012-2014.shp (589 KB):\n\nSame information as in NERP_eAtlas_data_1 June 2014_Conrad_Hoskin.xlsx but converted to a shapefile. This was created by the eAtlas team for adding into the mapping system.\n\n\nData Location:\n\nThis dataset is filed in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\NERP-TE\\3.3_Frog-surveys",

The maps and discussion of the data is presented in Product 2.1.2 for the Namoi subregion.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThese are the rasters that were developed from the source datasets (the Namoi leapfrog model from CDM Smith, the GAB Atlas and GABWRA) to create maps of the extent and thickness of the model layers. The layers were created in the following way:\n\nThe Rolling Downs Group layer was extracted from the GABATLAS Rolling Downs Aquitard - thickness and extent.  \n\nThe Pilliga Sandstone layer in the GAB was extracted from the GABATLAS Cadna-owie-Hooray Aquifer and Equivalents - Thickness and Extent. The Pilliga Sandstone in the Oxley (Gunnedah) Basin was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model.\n\nThe Purlawaugh Formation and Garrawilla Volcanics layer in the GAB was calculated using Layer 10 Great Artesian Basin base of Jurassic-Cretaceous sequence surface (GABWRA) and Layer 05 Great Artesian Basin base of Hooray Sandstone and equivalents surface (GABWRA). The Purlawaugh Formation and Garrawilla Volcanics in the Oxley (Gunnedah) Basin was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model.\n\nThe Interburden 1 layer was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model and combined the source layers of the Deriah and Napperby Formation, the Digby Formation and the Black Jack group above the Hoskissons Coal layer (layers 7, 8 and 9 in Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Hoskissons Coal layer was extracted directly from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model (layer 10 in the Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Interburden 2 layer was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model and combined the source layers of the Black Jack Group below the Hoskissons coal and the Millie Group (Watermark and Porcupine formations) (layers 11 and 12 in Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Maules Creek Formation layer was extracted directly from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model (layer 13 in the Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) Namoi BA geological model.

    "description": "    \n\nImpact Cost of Salinity 2000 a 2020 ($/ha/yr) dataset is one of 11 national\nsurfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic opportunities\nassociated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in 1996/97\nAustralian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a05.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "A dataset of enrolments (FTE) of all schools in Victoria, based on collections from the February 2022 schools census, including Government and non-Government Schools (Catholic and Independent schools).\nInformation collected from the February school census of Victorian schools: For each school, Full Time Equivalent (FTE) enrolments by school type and year level are included. A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.\nFor this 2022 census year data, the students' sex/gender category is not included for the following reasons:\n•   The gender of 'self-described' was implemented at the beginning of 2022 for Victorian government schools. Enrolments with this gender value are collected in the 2022 February School Census results but this value is currently under-represented.\n•   Due to the small numbers of enrolments with the 'self-described' gender, there is the potential for individuals to be identifiable at the school and year level.\n•   The 'self-described' counts are in their infancy and will likely increase over time but at this stage the department deems to risk of possible identification as too high for publication.",

    "description": "Modelling of landscape capacity for 75 landscape-managed NSW threatened species. \n\nLandscape capacity is a measure of how usable habitat is for supporting populations based on the quality of habitat and how easily species can move across the landscape to access sufficient resources to support a population. This project maps climate-informed landscape capacity. This mapping shows how well NSW landscapes can support fauna populations into future climate. The location of climate refugia are identified. These are areas that support species populations through time, from pre-industrial times and into the future.\n\nThe methods and descriptions of outputs are provided in the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/persistence-landscapes-project\">project report</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/d44cb0df-0242-4db3-9126-8c26aba7f80a/resource/27c36e75-690e-4fcd-88b4-b89bbdfafeba/download/plp_reportcards_final2025.pdf\">Two page species forecasts</a> summarise results for each species.\n\nEach species model is projected into NARCliM (v1.0) climate futures. The dataset comprises: individual models for 1750, 2000, 2030 and 2070 epochs; 'consensus' maps across 12 climate models for 2070; and multi-species refugia and landscape capacity across time maps (<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/edf6e375-57c5-4f55-93f0-422a0af1900c\">for the 75 threatened species</a>, and also including site-managed species <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/c76d5cd9-b3d1-4622-a4d5-55aed553e38b\">here</a>). \n\nThe individual species geotiff files are grouped into zip files which are large and may take considerable time to download.\n\nThese resources are outputs of the Persistence in the Landscape Project (PLP).

    "description": "Tasmania (Barrett, Lucier - TAFI; Johnson, Ling - UTAS) The primary objective of this work was to describe biological assemblages associated with rocky reef systems in deep shelf waters on the Tasman Peninsula in SE Tasmania and in the Huon, Freycinet and Bruny Island Marine Protected Areas (MPA), providing a record of community composition at or near the time of designation of these MPAs. Detailed multibeam sonar bathymetry data were previously collected by Geoscience Australia (GA) to provide high-resolution digital elevation maps of the study areas. These maps were used to determine suitable AUV survey locations. At each location, multiple reefs were surveyed at a range of depths from approximately 50 m to 100 m depth. Dive profiles were designed to provide sufficient replication to quantitatively determine abundances of key species/features within depth strata, within reefs, between reefs (km to 100 km scale), and between differing levels of reef complexity. The AUV deployments were part of a multi-disciplinary experimental program to analyse the covariance of co-located fine-resolution seabed habitat data, provided by the EM3002 multibeam sonar coverage, and biological datasets collected at similar spatial scales by Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Baited Remote Underwater Video systems, towed video and the AUV. This program was undertaken with UTAS and GA as part of the Marine Biodiversity Research Hub, a collaborative program funded under the Commonwealth Government's Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities Program. In addition, the AUV completed high resolution, full seafloor coverage day and night dives at St Helens in the North East to document nocturnal feeding habits of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii whose poleward extension has had a significant impact on kelp beds in the North East of Tasmania.\n\nTasmania 06/2009\nScallop fisheries at Maria Island, Freycinet MPA, St Helens urchin barrens, Bruny Island MPA; 18 dives over 7 days of operations.",

Primary correspondence school (later distance education centres) pupils are also included from 1938, and the school of the air pupils from 1976.\n\n\nFrom 1938, post-primary enrolments relate to student undertaking post-primary courses in high, intermediate high, district, junior high, central, superior public schools and correspondence school (later distance education centres). Pupils undertaking post- primary courses in small primary schools are also included. Evening continuation school pupils are not included.\n\n\nFor the period from 1881 to 1907 it has not been possible to isolate the number of post-primary pupils in superior public schools and consequently they are included under primary enrolments. This is the reason for the large jump in post-primary enrolments in 1908.\n\n\nFrom 1962 to 1983, all pupils in special schools or classes (except those in some community care schools who were not counted until 1981) are included as appropriate in the primary or post-primary figures and in the total.  Since 1984, students in Schools for Special Purposes have been counted separately.  Prior to 1962 it was difficult to ascertain if these pupils are included. Children in hospital schools and schools for the physically and intellectually disabled are sometimes included in the primary figures during the late 1950s, but physically and intellectually disabled children in special classes in ordinary schools are included from the late 1940s.\n\n\nThe enrolment figures between 1848 to 1918 are for the December quarter, with those for 1848 to 1851 and 1866 being estimates. From 1919 the annual census figures are used resulting in a sharp drop in primary and rise in post-primary enrolments in 1919. Pupils from the ACT are included until 1973, at which date they numbered 30,457.\n\n\nData source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin. Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

    "description": "Abundances of reef fish larvae, conspecific adults and habitat type were measured at 5 sites in the Lord Howe Island lagoon. Light traps were deployed daily over a 28 day period in November and December 2004 to estimated larvae abundances. Transects and visual surveys were used to estimate adult abundances and habitat type. Physical characteristics of the lagoon were measured using current meters, tide and wave gauges and the lunar phase was recorded.  \n\nAbundances of fish larvae was spatially and temporally variable. Different sites had different habitat type and variable adult abundances. Neither habitat type or adult abundances explained spatial variability in fish larvae. Temporal variability in fish larvae was best explained by the moon phase. There was little difference in physical characteristics between sites.",

    "title": "Leg 189 Synthesis: Cretaceous-Holocene  History of the Tasmanian Gateway",
    "description": "Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 189 drilled five sites in bathyal depths on submerged continental blocks in the Tasmanian Gateway, to help refine the hypothesis that its opening near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary led to formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), progressive thermal isolation of Antarctica, climatic cooling, and development of an Antarctic ice sheet. In all, 4539 m of marine and largely continuous upper Maastrichtian to Holocene core were recovered, with a recovery rate of 89%. The sedimentary sequence broadly consists of shallow marine mudstones until the late Eocene, glauconitic siltstones during the late Eocene, and pelagic carbonates thereafter. The microfossils in the mudstones and siltstones are largely palynomorphs and diatoms, and those in the carbonates are largely nannofossils and foraminifers.\n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, northward movement of Australia away from Antarctica commenced, forming the Australo-Antarctic Gulf (AAG). However, a Tasmanian land bridge at 70?-65?S almost completely blocked the eastern end of the widening AAG until the late Eocene, there being no evidence of extensive current circulation across the ridge until the earliest Oligocene. Prior to the Oligocene, muddy marine siliciclastic sediments were deposited in temperate seas. During the late Eocene, the northeastern AAG was warmer and less ventilated than the gradually widening southwest sector of the Pacific Ocean, which was affected by a cool, northwesterly flowing boundary current ? a difference that may have existed since the Maastrichtian. In the late Eocene (~37 Ma), the Tasmanian land bridge and its broad shelves began to subside, currents swept the still-shallow offshore areas, and condensed glauconitic siltstones were deposited. Palynological and diatom evidence suggest a general cooling. The southwestern South Tasman Rise finally separated from Antarctica at the time of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~33.5 Ma), the rise subsided, and the continental margin of Tasmania collapsed. The Tasmanian Gateway opened to deep water, disrupting oceanic circulation at high southern latitudes, and leading to one of the major climatic shifts of the Cenozoic.\n\nThereafter, a marked reduction in siliciclastic supply, and the flow of warm currents from northern latitudes, favored the deposition of carbonate. At the eastern sites, deposition of Oligocene bathyal carbonates directly followed an unconformity caused by the onset of the ACC, but change was more gradual in the west. In contrast, siliceous biogenic sediments typified the Antarctic margin, now isolated from warm water by the ACC. Steady northward movement kept the Tasmanian region north of the Polar Front throughout the Neogene, and pelagic carbonates accumulated.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Cocos Island - DEM - 2011\nIn 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to fly an airborne laser scanning survey of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The survey was carried out using a fixed wing aircraft between the 8th and 16th of August 2011 and covers the whole of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. All data was captured within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.4m to 1.3m. \n\nAAM classified the raw LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points using a single algorithm across the project area. The raw LiDAR points in the .las format were provided to Geoscience Australia along with 1km by 1km ESRI grid tiles generated by interpolation from the points. The tiles were then joined to create a DEM (TIFF) that covers the full extent of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Each cell, 1m x 1m, in the grid contains the height in metres of the ground surface. \n\nAs a guide, the DEM data is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm. A control survey was carried out by Whelans. Manual checking and editing was carried out by AAM to improve accuracy. Positional accuracy has been checked by Geoscience Australia and was found to match the ground surface well.   The DEM grid file was generated in GDA94 and has been converted to UTM WGS 84 zone 47s to fit the rest of the Cocos GIS data.  Vertical data was collected in the Cocos Keeling Island Height Datum (CKIHD).\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

    "description": "This dataset is a subset of the Sedimentary Basins dataset developed by Geoscience Australia. It represents those sedimentary basins in the North-west commonwealth marine planning region that are considered to be prospective for petroleum, and it has been attributed with a rating describing the relative prospectivity of different areas. This interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity is derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins. The classification terms used represent a simplified qualitative assessment of petroleum prospectivity, and are subject to future change as new data are gathered and interpreted.\n\nThe information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the North-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe Sedimentary Basins dataset itself provides outlines for the maximum extent of Australian geological provinces and their components, including sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic provinces, both onshore and offshore.  These data were compiled as part of Geoscience Australia's integrated digital information system to provide improved accessibility and knowledge relating to the petroleum and minerals geology and prospectivity, and to provide a national stratigraphic and tectonic framework for Australia.  The current Sedimentary Basins dataset is not complete for Australia, and covers only offshore sedimentary provinces and a selection of sedimentary and igneous provinces in onshore eastern Australia.The information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the North-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe following caveat applies to the use of the data in any mapping products:\n'The interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity are derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins.

Regional Department of Water and Environmental Regulation officers identified areas of similar management requirements to define boundaries or aggregations of hydrographic subcatchments. Regions with notable management concerns both currently and possibly in the future were identified to become management subareas. Allocation subareas will be used in the calculation of sustainable yields, flow rates and ultimately these calculations will be available for water allocation and natural resource management decisions. In addition, native vegetation clearing values have been calculated for each of the subareas located within the extent of the South-West region of Western Australia, for input into the allocation process.\n\nThe Surface Water subarea data was developed in order to give a clear understanding of surface water availability and to provide management tools to make good water allocation and natural resources management decisions.",

In collaboration with the NSW Rural Fire Service, DPE Remote Sensing &amp; Regulatory Mapping team has developed a semi-automated approach to mapping fire extent and severity through a machine learning framework based on sentinel 2 satellite imagery. The statewide severity map has standardised classes to allow comparison of different fires across the landscape. The FESM severity classes include: unburnt, low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy), moderate severity (partial canopy scorch), high severity (complete canopy scorch, partial canopy consumption), extreme (full canopy consumption).\n\nThis dataset represents the 2017/18 fire year, including wildfires &gt;100ha with fire start date between July 2017 and June 2018.",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of Affected Family Members (AFMs) of Family Violence Intervention Order (FVIO) applications heard in the Victorian Magistrates' Court, retrieved from Courtlink. The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of AFMs per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of AFMs on original applications in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: AFM rate = (Number of AFMs/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nTo avoid double counting individuals, demographic information of applicants/AFMs and respondents are of those on original applications.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nDue to improvements made in data processing since the database release ending 30 June 2017, slight movement has occurred in numbers of AFMs and the number of applications outcomes.\n\n\nData was extracted from Courtlink on 30 August 2018.\n\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the cattle tick model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \n\nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This spreadsheet provides historical time-series data for the cash aggregates - cash receipts, cash payments and net cash flows - of the general government sector and includes forecasts from the 2014-2015 Budget.\nThe Cash Flow Statement shows the trends in general government sector aggregate cash flows over the period 1986-87 to 2014-15. This table of historical data has been compiled as far as possible on an AAS basis, and from 2004-05 onwards, is consistent with the AASB 1049 cash flow statement presentation.\nThe data from 1997-98 include the transactions of government schools and arts institutions on a gross operating basis, as well as the full trading operations of TAFE institutes and hospitals, nursing homes and ambulances. Although this expanded coverage does not materially influence the net operating result for the general government sector, it does significantly increase the inflows and outflows presented in the cash flow statement. \nThe general government sector comprises all government departments, offices and other bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. General government services include those which are mainly non-market in nature, those which are largely for collective consumption by the community and those which involve the transfer or redistribution of income.",

This is a land use nomenclature and classification scheme for Australia, ordering land use in a systematic, logical and consistent way. The ALUM Classification has been developed in collaboration with national, state and territory agencies as part of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). \r\n\r\n This document updates Part 2 of the  Guidelines for land use mapping in Australia: principles, procedures and definitions, 4th Edition published by ABARES in 2011. It reflects current needs and experience in classifying land use of national, state and territory agency partners involved in ACLUMP. \r\n\r\n The ALUM Classification has a three-tiered hierarchical structure. Primary, secondary and tertiary classes are broadly structured by the potential degree of modification and the impact on a putative 'natural state' (essentially, a native land cover). The ALUM Classification version 8 includes fields to collect commodity and land management practice information. ",

The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of unpublished Department of Health data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nThe rates by PHN should be interpreted with caution as these services are predominantly provided in non-metropolitan areas. Rates were calculated for some metropolitan areas for comparison purposes, as these areas were only included in the program from 2014–15, and only a small number of services were provided there\n\n\nPatients may have more than 1 occasion of service.\n\n\nThe identification of Indigenous patients varies between practitioners, so the number of occasions of service for Indigenous patients may be understated.\n\n",

The data was collected at high-resolution spatial and temporal coverage to facilitate an analysis of Lakes level behaviour and hydrodynamic model (HDM) calibration.  The data is accessible through the software \"Lakes Explorer\" version 5.0, written by Dr K.S. Tan in Microsoft® Excel 2000© Visual Basic® for Application (Excel VBA).

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2016 projection, relative to a 2011 baseline, based on a scenario of buildings being retrofitted. It does not include the industrial sector.",

    "description": "This project will act as an integrating focus within the rainforest theme to strategically target research gaps and thereby increase our understanding of the drivers of rainforest biodiversity. We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. \n\nThe project consists of four subprojects:\n\nA. Monitoring: Tasks include a microsensor network, standardised vertebrate surveys, habitat structure monitoring and data harvesting from other projects. \n\nA comprehensive review of regional literature followed by extensive stakeholder consultation identified long-term monitoring data as the most important knowledge gap in the region (Welbergen et al. 2011). This sub-project is aimed at maintaining and significantly improving a regional-scale, long-term environmental monitoring program that provides biodiversity and environmental data that has a demonstrated value to a wide range of users including the research community, regional/state/national management agencies and conservation policy development, and national / international bioinformatic infrastructure initiatives (e.g. ALA, TERN). Data collected and maintained here will provide the primary input for the other sub-projects described below with flow-on inputs to many of the other proposed projects across the rainforest node. These data will include but not be limited to:\n1. Regional microclimate sensor network at more than 30 sites established under MTSRF that are strategically placed across elevational and latitudinal gradients in the region.\no Replace and upgrade existing microclimate stations (now defunct/worn out)\no Establish standardised microclimate logging stations in new sites in gaps in environmental coverage, identified climatic refugia, peripheral habitat isolates and increased coverage of the rainforest edge habitats (e.g. wet sclerophyll). Data: temperature (air, soil, microhabitats), humidity, soil moisture, cloud interception.\n2. Standardised vertebrate surveys across all long-term sites (>30) including:\no  2-4 complete surveys per year for three years with 6 replicated sampling points within each site and including standardised surveys of: birds, reptiles, spotlighting (mammals and other nocturnal fauna) and microhylid frogs, with potential to add specific other groups dependent on student projects. \no These surveys follow well-established and extensively published methodologies within the CTBCC (e.g. Williams et al. Ecology 2010).  \n3. Habitat structure monitoring will be continued and improved at all monitoring sites both directly by this project and via site-based collaboration with other projects including rainforest dynamics project (Project 10 - Laurance) and plant genetics (Project 9 -Crayn). \n4. Link to Project 14: potential monitoring of vegetation structure and thermal properties using UAV technology to capture aerial photos, multispectral remote sensing, Lidar vegetation structure, thermal imagery of habitat and fauna, cyclone damage and canopy condition.\n5. Additional monitoring data will be harvested across the node for increased regional and taxonomic coverage and baseline data improvements via links and data exchange with Projects 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 25. \n\n\nB. Climate change vulnerability and adaptation: Includes the production of downscaled regional climate projections, projected changes in species distribution models, composite biodiversity maps, identification and mapping of climate refugia, predictive models of impacts on biodiversity including extreme events. \n\nClimate change is arguably the single largest threat to biodiversity in Australia and the unique biodiversity of the Wet Tropics rainforests is recognised as one of the most threatened ecosystems globally (IPCC 4th AR). This subproject will build on previous and existing research to provide cutting-edge predictions on climate change impacts, vulnerability assessment and adaptation options for rainforest biodiversity. We will link closely with the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Network to ensure that outputs, tools and approaches are distributed across this network for maximum national and regional benefit and outcomes.  Specific objectives and collaborative links include:\n1. Produce and make available downscaled regional climate projections using eight Global Climate Models across multiple (at least 3) emission scenarios at 10 year time steps from 1970-2080 for more than 50 bioclimatic variables;\n2. Projected changes, including uncertainty estimates, in species distribution models and composite biodiversity maps for the majority of rainforest vertebrates, 500+ species of invertebrates, major vegetation types and some key ecosystem processes (baseline data for these analyses were collected under MTSRF and ongoing projects within the CTBCC);\n3. Identify and map climatic refugia (extension of previous MTSRF work that mapped landscape-scale temperature refugia by Shoo et al. 2010a, 2010b). This analysis will expand previous work to include finer scale microhabitat refugia and also increase the generality of the analyses by examining moisture refugia and dry season drought events that have been shown to have significant impacts on biodiversity (Williams & Middleton 2008, Middleton & Williams in review). \n4. Produce predictive impact models on biodiversity that explicitely include a consideration of extreme events rather than just environmental means/averages. Project will link closely with the extreme climate events project (Project 16 ¿ Welbergen) to incorporate the impacts of changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and extent of extreme events, such as heat waves and droughts, as a major component of assessing relative vulnerability and adaptation actions; \n5. Project will closely collaborate with Project 15 (Phillips, Llewelyn) examining the potential for useful local adaptation to climate changeextremes in isolated populations. This link explores the potential to utilise existing adaptive potential as a means to increase species resilience to climate change.\n6. Other external links:\n¿ NCCARF Refugia project (National) -  proposed\n¿ NCCARF Terrestrial Biodiversity Research Network\n¿ Northern Biodiversity NERP Hub\n¿ AEDA Hub ¿ Restoration project and Future Fellowship (Wintle) examining demographic modelling and climate change.\n7. Incorporate IPCC 5th Assessment Report climate models and scenarios into all above analyses, once they become available.\n\nC. Synthesis, analysis and integration: Determinants of biodiversity: Includes mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and 200+ species of invertebrates, identify key monitoring locations, examining the relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure. \n\nAn understanding of the drivers of biodiversity in the region is crucial to predicting impacts from a variety of threats and ensuring effective conservation planning and management that aims to maintain a resilient landscape. We will use data collected in subproject A in combination with our existing extensive vertebrate and invertebrate database to examine the drivers of biodiversity in the region and to provide the resources and knowledge to make this useful to stakeholders. Specific objectives will include, but not be limited to: \n1. Mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and >500 species of invertebrates (distribution and abundance) with emphasis on threatened species;\n2. Identify key locations and taxa where we have long-term count data and/or high frequency of repeat count surveys over time periods that have encompassed important environmental change. We will undertake statistical power analyses to evaluate condition and trends of species (e.g., range shifts, change in population size);\n3. Analyses will also inform the design of our ongoing monitoring program (subproject A) to maximise the detection of change in a cost-effective manner. \n4. Comprehensive habitat/vegetation type vulnerability assessment;\n5. Examine a range of environmental and evolutionary drivers of biodiversity to provide the basic scientific underpinnings for evidence-based policy and management in the region including paleostability of habitat; seasonal habitat and climatic stability, relationships to ecosystem processes such as net primary productivity, habitat structure and heterogeneity, species and habitat compositional turnover and evolutionary biology.\n6. Examine relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure (vegetation type and structure, habitat extent, connectivity etc.)\n\nD. Status, trends and future projections: Includes Producing a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets.\n\nNo practical measure currently exists to evaluate trends in biodiversity values at the ¿whole-of-region¿ scale in near real-time on a regular, repeatable and affordable basis (WTMA Research Strategy 2010-2014). We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. This will be the major vehicle for synthesizing, integrating and communicating data from all projects. This project will make use of extensive computing power represented by the collaboration between the CTBCC and the James Cook University eResearch group and High Performance Computing Facility. Specific objectives:\n1. Produce and make publicly available a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets based on a user-defined spatial area that will return all predicted and observed data within the query area for climate (past, current and future projections), habitat, species (predicted and observed), biodiversity values, terrain, ecosystem processes and, where available data is site-based, the tool could query the temporal patterns in the data (e.g. changes in abundance of a species) with ¿approaching real-time¿ updates (expected bi-annual upload of all new biodiversity and environmental data with temporal resolution dependent on the specific data stream, example quarterly for the standardised vertebrate surveys).\n2. Automatic upload, synthesis and visualisation in JCU eResearch group (Tropical Data Hub) including time series examination of trends;\n3. Automated upload via Tropical Data Hub onto National (ALA, TERN, NPEI) and international (GBIF) data infrastructure. This means that as data is entered into our system from the monitoring program and other projects, it will be uploaded and available via national and international data portals;\n4. Future forecasting of trends and forecasts via combination of modelling and workshopping to conduct future horizon scanning.\n\nOnce established, these bioinformatic tools could form the basis for UNESCO, and Queensland and Australian government reporting on the state of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and could easily be utilized more generally across other ecosystems in Australia.",

    "description": "The collection has Australia-wide and Indo-Pacific representation, plus some world specimens for comparative purposes. The collection comprises 1200000 pinned specimens, 450000 specimens in spirit and 20000 slides. There are 8670 holotypes, of which 5000 are from the A.M. Lea beetle collection. There are 23000 other types. In summary, the entomological collections Class Insecta comprise 662 Australian families and 85,961 known Australian species. \nThe arachnological collections comprise spiders (50000 specimens in alcohol), mites (25000 slide mounts and 20000 specimens in alcohol), scorpions (5000 specimens in alcohol) and myriapods. \nImages from this collection are available on the Atlas of Living Australia.\nThe SA Museum manages this dataset using the KE EMu collection management system. It is interpreted into the Darwin Core metadata schema (DwC) and semi-regularly exported to the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (OZCAM). \nData sourced from Australian museums on both the ALA and OZCAM should be identical, but on ALA they are combined with observational data from citizen science initiatives and other sources. Both of those sites make it possible to combine, interrogate and analyse data through web services such as the Spatial Analysis Portal. In the Spatial Portal ALA data can be combined with meteorological and other environmental data sourced from and made accessible by relevant government agencies.\nThe ALA also has a fully documented API\nData about endangered species are either withheld from online publication, or coordinates or other data are obscured on the ALA and OZCAM. In those circumstances more specific information is available directly from SA Museum collection managers if it is genuinely required for research purposes.\nSA Museum data can be downloaded in full from the Atlas of Living Australia, or broken down into discipline specific parts (e.g. Herpetology, Mammalogy etc). On download the ALA will request an email address (not mandatory) and a reason for download (mandatory) – this is required to track usage of the ALA data to help data providers determine priorities for upload and improvement.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with imaging costs, and out-of-pocket cost per diagnostic imaging service attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDiagnostic imaging services are Medicare-subsidised diagnostic imaging procedures such as x-rays, computerised tomography scans, ultrasound scans, magnetic resonance imaging scans and nuclear medicine scans.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "title": "Alpine Redspot Dragonfly Indicative Distribution in NSW",
    "description": "The Alpine Redspot Dragonfly (Austropetalia tonyana) is a\nmoderate-sized dragonfly. The larvae grow to 32-35mm long and\nadults grow to 70-80mm long. It is a habitat specialist, occurring only\nwithin very specific geographic locations. It is naturally rare, with few\nrecordings of the species in New South Wales since the 1950s. In\nNSW, the Alpine Redspot Dragonfly is restricted to mountainous\nregions below 35°S that reach above 600 – 1,800 metres above\nsea level. Individuals have extremely specific habitat requirements in\nthat they only occur amongst rocks, logs and moss within the splash\nzone of waterfalls or in the nearby stream edge.\nThey are an endangered species -\nhttps://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/speciesprotection/conservation/what-current/vulnerable-species/alpineredspot-dragonfly. \nThe methods used to create the predicted current\ndistribution of Alpine Redspot Dragonfly are described fully in: NSW\nDepartment of Primary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community\nStatus 2015 – Final Report.\nAll available records of the species were collated and assessed for\naccuracy. For current distribution, only records after 1 January 1994\nwere used. Within the framework of the Australian Hydrological\nGeospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network, the records were\nassociated with attributes from the National Environmental Stream\nAttributes Database and River Styles® geomorphology. The\nAustralian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network (Geofabric) is a fully connected and directed stream network\nbased a 9 second DEM. It allocates a unique stream segment\nnumber to each river reach in Australia. The Environmental\nAttributes Database is a set of lookup tables supplying attributes\ndescribing the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the\nstream and catchment environment that was developed by the\nAustralian National University (ANU) in 2011 and updated in 2012.\nThe data is supplied as part of the supplementary Geofabric\nproducts which is associated with the 9 second DEM derived\nstreams and the National Catchment Boundaries based on 250k\nscale stream network. 30 Stream variables were assessed for the\nmodelling.\nRiver Styles® provides a high resolution categorical classification of\nriver character within a nested hierarchy of criteria based on valley\nsetting, channel planform, geomorphic units, and bed material. The\nNSW Office of Water compiled a spatial dataset of River Styles®\nclassifications for a large number of the waterways of NSW. From 65\nRiver Style® categories we generated two new fields representing\nPlanform (34 categories) and Substratum (8 categories) for each\nstream segment. River Style® planform and substratum categories\nwere then assigned to each Geofabric segment.\nMaxEnt 3.3.3 is a widely used species distribution modelling program\nthat utilises presence records to generate probabilities of occurrence\nbased on a suite of environmental variables quantified across the\narea of interest. It was used to model the current geographic\ndistribution of each listed threatened freshwater aquatic species or\npopulation. We utilised logistic output to plot the predicted\ndistribution of each species. This output equates to a probability that\nthe species will be observed in each river reach, given the\nenvironmental conditions that exist there relative to the\nenvironmental conditions where the species is known to occur. For\nthis mapping, above 33% probability was considered predicted\npresence. In addition, predicted separate populations were\nconnected by manual interpretation. The predicted values for each\nriver reach were converted from the Geofabric framework to the\nhigher resolution 2013 NSW Strahler Stream Order Hydroline.",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.   \n \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 4m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "Geodiversity is fundamental to the integrity of broader ecological processes. It is also important in contributing to the richness and interest of our environment and in providing opportunities for scientific study of the earth's development. \n\nSome elements of geodiversity are relatively robust in the face of human intervention; others are susceptible to degradation associated with a range of land use practices. An effective approach to geoconservation must include the development and implementation of protective management principles designed specifically to protect the vulnerable elements of geodiversity.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:100000 scale) detailing geological, geomorphological, and soil sites of conservation and heritage value. Geoconservation sites are given a unique code and the relevant National Estate values and criteria. The coverage also has an attached relate file detailing name of site, mapsheet on which site is located, size classification of site, sensitivity of the site to impacts, conservation status, National Estate status, National Estate criteria against which the site has been assessed etc.\n\nNational Estate criteria against which Geoconservation sites can be assessed include:\nA1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate.\nA2: Importance in maintaining existing processes or natural systems at the regional or national scale.\nA3: Importance in exhibiting unusual richness or diversity of flora, fauna, landscapes or cultural features.\nB1: Importance for rare, endangered or uncommon flora, fauna, communities, ecosystems, natural landscapes or phenomena, or as wilderness.\nC1: Importance for information contributing to a wider understanding of Australian natural history, by virtue of its use as a research site, teaching site, type locality, reference or benchmark site.\nC2: Importance for information contributing to a wider understanding of the history of human occupation of Australia.\nD1: Importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the range of human activities in the Australian environment.\nH1: Importance for close associations with individuals whose activities have been significant within the history of the nation, State or region.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1997-1999.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "title": "IMOS - AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance",
    "description": "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal:- https://portal.aodn.org.au. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledgment all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

This specific dataset presents the median rental costs of 3 bedroom flats by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nThe rent figures included in the Rental Report are weekly median rents. Median rents represent the midpoint in the distribution of all rents. Fifty per cent of rents are higher than the median and fifty per cent are below the median.\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "TPA has a range of location information products which include digitised boundaries. Travel Zones (TZs) are the geographic units of TPA’s data collection, transport modelling and analysis. They are designed to align as much as possible with current Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) geographic classification for that year, to allow for comparison of different data sources at standard geographies.\nIn order to provide for a similar level of trip generation across zones, TZs are designed to be small in areas with high land use densities and larger in areas of lower density. The key land uses of interest in defining TZs are employment, housing and transport infrastructure.\nAs urban areas change over time, TPA creates a new zoning system in line with each 5-yearly population Census. Digitised boundaries for these zoning systems and equivalences between them, are available to users to undertake spatial analysis.\n1991 – 2006 – Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC), with Statistical Local Areas (SLA), Census Collection District (CCD) and Mesh Blocks (MB). Prior to 2006, TZs aligned to Statistical Local Areas (SLA).\nGMA may change slightly at the boundary to align with ABS geographic classifications. This will not usually impact on the comparison of data over time.",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof forest and non-forest land over which Indigenous peoples and\r\ncommunities have ownership, management, or rights of use, assembled\r\nfor *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from\r\nmultiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets\r\nrelated to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous\r\nland dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the\r\nForests of Australia (2018) dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies Indigenous land into four categories:\r\n*Indigenous owned and managed: freehold land that is both owned\r\nand managed by Indigenous communities\r\n*Indigenous managed: land that is managed, but not owned, by\r\nIndigenous communities; and lands that are owned by Indigenous\r\npeople but have formal shared management agreements with\r\nAustralia and state and territory government agencies\r\n*Indigenous co-managed: land that is owned and managed by other\r\nparties, but has a formal, legally binding agreement in place that\r\nincludes input from Indigenous people in the process of\r\ndeveloping and implementing a management plan\r\n*Other Special rights: land subject to native title determination,\r\nregistered Indigenous land use agreement, and legislated special\r\ncultural use provision.\r\n\r\nThe *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "In the context of Australia as a whole, Tasmania, as a region, is not regarded as exceptionally diverse for most floral groups. This pattern is consistent with the usual tropical-temperate diversity shift seen in most parts of the world. On a regional basis, however, some areas are obviously significant in terms of flora species richness.  \n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criterion A3: Importance in exhibiting unusual richness or diversity of flora, fauna, landscapes or cultural features\n\nThe assessment for this criterion was divided into two areas of analysis: the richness of flora species and the richness of forest communities. Species-level richness is often referred to as alpha (a), or within-area, diversity and is usually measured as the number of species occurring within an area of a given size. Forest community richness is effectively a surrogate measure of the rate of change of species: a between-area, or beta (b) diversity, measure. It is often a good reflection of environmental diversity, where strong gradients produce rapid transitions of different forest communities and their associated species.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:500 000 scale) detailing sites with a high flora species or community richness. Species richness and community richness of flora are coded with a unique number, the relevant National Estate values and criteria, and cleared land status.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was derived by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the History field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis boundary was developed in consultation with the Northern Territory Government and is informed by the principles described in the draft Northern Territory Strategic Regional Environmental Bioregional Assessment Framework.   For terrestrial ecosystems these are:\r\n\r\nFor the ecology domains of the SREBA, the boundary should be determined following consideration of the following spatial areas: \r\n•\tbiogeographical boundaries \r\n•\tgeological (sub)basin boundaries with the gas resource\r\n•\tencompass the spatial distribution of ecological values on which gas development in that region could feasibly have an impact, including predictable indirect impacts; and\r\n•\tinclude sufficient bioregional extent to provide adequate context to assess the significance of any potential impact.   \r\nIn general, these boundaries should correspond to IBRA sub-bioregions.  However, additional consideration should be given to:\r\n•\twhere gas development can feasibly only occur in one part of a large region, sub-regional boundaries may be appropriate\r\n•\twhere only a small portion of a bioregion overlaps the edge of a gas (sub)basin, that entire bioregion cannot be cost-effectively be incorporated in the SREBA, so only a portion of that subregion should be included \r\n•\twhere there is potential for significant downstream impacts from development (notably on the quality or quantity of ground- or surface water), the boundary may extend out of the bioregion where development will occur, likely following (sub)catchment boundaries.          \r\n\r\nThe principles for aquatic ecosystems are similar, with a stronger emphasis on catchment or sub-catchment boundaries, and the extent of underlying aquifers that support ground-water dependent ecosystems; and also noting the need to sensibly limit the spatial extent of the study  in relation to downstream catchment areas, especially where there is no feasible impact pathway.\r\n\r\nThese principles were applied to derive the proposed Beetaloo GBA extended region boundary, primarily based on the boundaries of the Birdum (STU3) and Newcastle (STU2) subregions of the Sturt Plateau Bioregion.  In order to explain where and why it deviates from these subregions boundaries, starting at the northern edge and moving counter clockwise:\r\n-\tthe northern edge follows the bioregion boundary.  Importantly, this corresponds to the Roper River in the Mataranka springs area.  For this section, the boundary has been extended to capture the Mataranka Thermal Pools. The north western edge also captures the springs feeding toward the Flora River, but may need to check this and adjust slightly so that these GDEs are included\r\n-\ton the western edge, the boundary diverts from the bioregion and follows the boundary of the Daly and then Roper Drainage Basins, and then cuts southward to rejoin the southern boundary of the Newcastle subregion.  This pragmatically exclude some of the most western extent of STU3 and STU2, which are geographically distant from the gas basin, and which are unlikely to add useful regional context to any of the ecology values. The GDE’s on the King River in the northwest have been included within the boundary.\r\n-\tIt is considered essential to include Lake Woods in the study area, so a portion of the boundary of Mitchell Grass Downs (MGD2) is used to do this. The boundary then cuts across the top of the Mitchell Grass Downs to rejoin the STU2 boundary\r\n-\tThe boundary cuts north to meet and use the western boundary of the McArthur River Basin – this excludes the most eastern extent of STU2, for similar reasons as above for excluding the most western extent\r\n-\tIn the eastern section, the most easterly extent of the Beetaloo sub-basin just enters the Gulf Fall Bioregion.  This is ecologically very different to the Sturt Plateau, and so the requirement to sample in this area needs to be sensibly constrained.  A 20km buffer from the edge of the gas basin.  The boundary therefore encompasses the headwaters of some drainages that flow into the Limmen and Roper Rivers.   \r\n-\tThe boundary then follows the STU bioregion boundary back to the northern edge.   This includes the upper reaches of the Strangways River and Maryfield Creek.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was derived using: NTGS Beetaloo Sub-basin boundary (A7710381-78BF-4E1F-B015-A9E874599F47), the DoEE Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (Subregions - States and Territories) v. 7 (IBRA) (F83F319E-C369-4548-BBEC-3AAD7AB40AE8), and GBA Beetaloo basin GDE (E4C2B147-8338-4821-BC5E-DE300E9B6362) as its data sources.",

    "description": "This datasets presents smooth values of the number of people in the labour force of Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) regions for each quarter starting December 2010 up to June 2018. The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2011 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2008 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The redrawing of ward boundaries was largely done to redress imbalances as the demographic makeup of the area changed over time. Ward boundary maps are a key resource to enable access to the online City of Sydney Assessment Books. These volumes detail property assessments from our incorporation in 1842, until 1948, when the NSW Valuer General's Department took over the task of assessing property value.

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.
