The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "Soil salinity hazard was digitally mapped as part of the DPIPWE Water for Profit Program to enhance identification of Enterprise Suitability by effectively incorporating a sustainability measure of vulnerable soils.  The mapping shows areas where a salinity hazard might exist if sufficient management is not applied, which could lead to soil resource degradation.  Assigned classes are; Low, Moderate and High as classified ratings of a salinity hazard index.  The index was generated by combining Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) inputs of the soil properties of Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Clay % for standard depths, with ratings developed by the DPIPWE Land Degradation and Salinity Risk assessments.  The mapping covers the entire state of Tasmania at 30m resolution.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed in 100m of water, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular, Jervis Bay. This mooring housed 3 current meters (at 30m, 55m and 90m water depth) and also a tide gauge. Over a period of approx. 8 months the mooring was deployed 3 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1 - 35.16 S, 150.817 E. \nDeployments 2 & 3 - 35.1267 S, 150.825 E. Datasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the three current meters over the study period.\n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 3 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2 & 3) for the upper two meters at 30m and 55m water depth. The current meter at 90m utilised sampling intervals of 10mins (deployments 1 & 2) and 30mins (deployment 3). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 11/4/89 - 5/6/89... 2) 28/7/89 - 29/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 29/11/89\n\nTIDE GAUGE: The tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~100m for all three deployments  In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

Almost two thirds of convicts were English (along with a small number of Scottish and Welsh), with the Irish making up the remaining one third.\nConvicts were usually given sentences of transportation for seven, 14 years or life. Some convicts in the 1830s received ten-year sentences. About one quarter of the convicts were sentenced to ‘the term of their natural lives’, and a proportion of these had reprieves from the death sentence.\nThese seven indexes contain around 140,000 entries in total.",

    "description": "Access APIMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleFairfield Road Segment 3D May 2024Content TypeScene Layer/Scene Layer PackageDescriptionNSW Transport Theme Road Segment is a line feature class representing a section of road having common attributes and terminating at its physical and or at an intersection with another road at the same grade (same level). Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

The voyage took place between November 14 and November 26, 2017 departing from Fremantle (WA) and arriving in Hobart (TAS). \nThe Kongsberg SBP120 (sub bottom profiler) was used to acquire data containing the specular reflections at different sediment interfaces below the seafloor. The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP120 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\nData are stored in .raw (139 files 12.2 GB) raw and .seg (139 files 12.2 GB) segy formats at CSIRO. Dedicated shelf transects were run from 15/11/2018 until 20/11/2018.\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request",

These data resources include information on epidemiology and distribution of the pathogen as well as yield and grain quality loss caused by RLS.\nAccurate identification of RLS is indispensable for effective crop management. These data resources include information for RLS identification in Australian barley crops. This knowledge facilitates timely intervention for disease control, minimizes crop mismanagement, and mitigates losses in yield and grain quality due to RLS disease.\nThe datasets on this page include information on genetic and population diversity of Ramularia collo-cygni in Australia, disease incidence, triggers, potential regional relationships, and the quantification of economic losses stemming from this pathogen. Additionally, these resources include insights into the contributions of seeds, stubble, and alternate hosts in pathogen dissemination and disease development, as well as best practices for disease management and fungicide resistance.\nThese data resources result from collaborative research co-funded by the NSW Department of Primary Industries and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. These data resources include datasets which are available to download as well as metadata for resources which have restricted access and will be made available only on request.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of small for gestational age births, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nBabies are defined as small for gestational age if their birthweight is below the 10th percentile for their gestational age and sex, according to national birthweight percentiles. Includes singleton liveborn babies with known birthweight, gestational age and sex.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

    "title": "The ecology and impacts of the introduced basket clam, Corbula gibba in Port Phillip Bay, Australia",
    "description": "This thesis describes the ecology and impact of the introduced European basket clam, Corbula gibba (Olivi, 1792), in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. A bay-wide survey conducted in 1998 found C. gibba throughout the bay but it was significantly more abundant in deeper, muddier sites. Life history studies carried out at three sites found that two sites were dominated by a single cohort of large adults while the third site had one cohort of adults and one of juveniles.  This juvenile cohort grew at a rate of about 4 mm2 per month but experienced high mortality, with only 0.5% surviving a six month period. Longer term abundance patterns available at St. Leonards, and supplemented by this study, found that, between 1969 and 1999, adult density varied between 0 and 106 individuals per m2 while juveniles were found in varying densities in 5 of 6 years sampled. The effect of anthropogenic disturbance on resident populations and subsequent invasion by C. gibba into disturbed sites was assessed experimentally using scallop dredging. Scallop dredging did not affect resident populations but the impact on subsequent invasion by C. gibba could not be determined as recruitment failed to occur over the study period and adult migration was not observed. The effect of ambient densities of C. gibba on endemic species such as the commercial scallop, Pecten fumatus, was investigated experimentally in the field.  These experiments found that C. gibba significantly reduced the size and growth of juvenile P. fumatus to a greater extent than an equivalent number of conspecific scallops. Competition for shared food resources did not appear to be the mechanism underlying this impact, however, as dietary studies found that C. gibba was not a superior competitor. Additional studies found that C. gibba did not affect the recruitment of the native bivalves, Mytilus edulis and Electroma Georgiana, but significantly reduced conspecific recruitment. This effect is likely to have implications for the structure of C.gibba populations in the bay.",

During high rainfall events the catchment areas behave differently to deliver contaminants into the Port Jackson estuary. Under conditions of high rainfall contaminants are delivered to areas very quickly as freshwater slides over the top of the denser more saline waters of the estuary. Samples were taken along the Port Jackson estuary over two days to determine the behaviour of the freshwater plume as it travels in a layer of freshwater to be flushed or flocculate out at some point in the estuary. Samples were analysed for Al, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations.",

    "title": "Wallaby Creek Flux Data Release 2024_v2",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe forest is classed as a tall, wet sclerophyll forest, and the dominant <em>Eucalyptus Regnans</em> or mountain ash trees have an average canopy height of 75&nbsp;m. The site contains a chronosequence of (20, 80 and 300) stand ages that were established during fires occurring over the last 300 years. The area is assigned the IUCN Category II (National Parks) of the United Nations’ list of National Parks and protected areas, which means the park is primarily managed for ecosystem conservation. The catchment area is dominated by mountain ash, the world’s tallest flowering plant (angiosperm). Trees can reach heights of more than 90&nbsp;m in areas with high rainfall and fertile soil. Mountain ash forests are confined to the cool mountain regions with elevations ranging from 460 to 1100&nbsp;m and average rainfalls of 1100 to 2000&nbsp;mm/y. These trees are well distributed throughout Victoria’s Central Highlands including the Otway Ranges and Strzlecki Ranges; they are also found in Tasmania. The catchment area contains a portion of the Mt. Disappointment range, the Divide and the headwaters of Wallaby Creek and Silver Creek, and much of the slopes are characterised as flat to moderate.\n\nThe station itself is located within an old growth stand with individual trees as old as 300 years. Below the dominant canopy lies a temperate rainforest understorey consisting of <em>Pomaderris aspera</em> and <em>Olearia argophylla</em> species, which are 10 to 18&nbsp;m tall. The lower layers of vegetation are dominated by tree ferns (<em>Cyathea australis</em> and <em>Dicksonia antartica</em>) and extensive tracts of rosette and rhizonic ferns (<em>Polystichum proliferum</em> and <em>Blechnum wattsii</em>) as well as acacia trees. The elevation is approximately 720&nbsp;m. The major soil type within the forest is krasnozemic soils, which are friable red/brown soils, with high amounts of organic matter in the upper 20 to 30&nbsp;cm. However, the composition of krasnozemic soils is not homogenous, but rather varies with altitude. Grey-yellow podsolised soils can be found at lower altitudes, while krasnozemic loams is characteristic of the higher altitudes of the Kinglake and of the Hume Plateau. The clay content of these soils increases with depth until at least 200&nbsp;cm deep, where after a transition soils contain rock fragments. The climate of the study area is classified as a cool, temperate zone, with the highest temperatures occurring during the summer months of December – February (13.8 to 22.5&nbsp;°C), whilst the coolest temperatures are experienced in May and August (4.7 to 9.2&nbsp;°C). Average annual precipitation is 1209&nbsp;mm, with a maximum rainfall occurring in June (Ashton, 2000). The study site experiences foggy conditions after sunset during autumn and winter.\n\nThe original station had a main mast at 110&nbsp;m. This station was destroyed in February 2009 by bushfires. A replacement station was established in March 2010 and started recording in May 2010. The mast sat at a height of 5&nbsp;m. The post-fire instrumentation was not as diverse as the pre-fire instrumentation.",

    "description": "<b>Version Oct 2021</b>\nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Caboolture West Local Plan and  North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nFor more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/subsite.aspx?id=139941\">helpful information sheets</a> or contact Council. \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Further details on the Qld Planning Provisions can be found <a href=\"https://www.dilgp.qld.gov.au/planning/state-planning-instruments/queensland-planning-provisions.html\">here</a>.",

    "title": "AIHW - Mental Health Services - Emergency Department Presentations (SA3) 2014-2018",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of emergency department presentations in public hospitals by patient location. Mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations are defined as presentations to public hospital EDs that have a principal diagnosis of mental and behavioural disorders. However, the definition does not fully capture all potential mental health-related presentations to EDs such as intentional self-harm, as intent can be difficult to identify in an ED environment and can also be difficult to code. The data spans the financial years of 2014-2018 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nState and territory health authorities collect a core set of nationally comparable information on most public hospital ED presentations in their jurisdiction, which is compiled annually into the National Non-Admitted Patient Emergency Department Care Database (NNAPEDCD). The data reported for 2014–15 to 2017–18 is sourced from the NNAPEDCD. Information about mental health-related services provided in EDs prior to 2014–15 was supplied directly to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) by states and territories.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCaution is required when conducting time-series analyses. The data source changed in 2014–15 from data provided by state and territory health authorities (2004–05 to 2013–14) to the NNAPEDCD. Additionally, due to the methodology applied for mapping the data over time, years prior to 2017–18 may be an undercount or data may not be displayed where SA3s have changed over time.\n\n\nMental health-related emergency department presentations included in this report are those that had a principal diagnosis that fell within the Mental and behavioural disorders chapter (Chapter 5) of ICD-10-AM (codes F00–F99) or the equivalent ICD-9-CM or SNOMED codes. It does not include codes for self-harm or poisoning.\n\n\nFrom 2014–15 onwards, diagnosis information was not reported using a uniform classification. The mapping of SNOMED codes (used by NSW) to ICD-10AM may lead to an under-estimation of mental health-related presentations.\n\n\nChanges in the volume of patients over time for NSW may be attributed, in part, to the increased number of hospitals included in the data for this jurisdiction.\n\n",

It was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to data supplied by the states and territories to allow seamless integration. \r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "The most common poverty measures, including that used by the OECD, focus on income based approaches.  One of the most common measures of income poverty is the proportion of households with income less than half median equivalised disposable household income (which is set as the poverty line); this is a relative income poverty measure as poverty is measured by reference to the income of others rather than in some absolute sense. Australia has one of the highest household disposable incomes in the world, which means that an Australian relative income poverty line is set at a high level of income compared to most other countries. \r\n\r\nOECD statistics on Australian poverty 2015-16 (based on ABS Survey of Income and Housing data and applying a poverty line of 50% of median income) determined the Australian poverty rate was over 25% before taxes and transfers, but falls around 12% after taxes and transfers. Though measuring poverty through application of solely an income measure is not considered comprehensive for an Australian context, however, it does demonstrate that the Australian welfare system more than halves the number of Australians that would otherwise be considered as at risk of living in poverty under that measure.  \r\nIt is important to consider a range of indicators of persistent disadvantage to understand poverty and hardship and its multidimensional nature. Different indicators point to different dimensions of poverty. \r\nWhile transient poverty is a problem, the experience of persistent poverty is of deeper concern, particularly where families experience intergenerational disadvantage and long-term welfare reliance.  HILDA data from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research shows the Distribution of number of years in poverty 2001–2015. The figure focuses on the longer term experience of working age adults and shows that while people do fall into poverty, only a small proportion of people are persistently poor.\r\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in March 2009, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study Norman Sub-Model. This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "These data sets include the picoplankton component analysed by flow cytometry from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. \nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

This data includes air temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed and direction, with most stations also measuring incoming solar radiation to calculate evaporation.\n\nThe weather stations report to DPIRD’s website every 10 minutes and provide near real time data. Local weather, such as rainfall or frost, can vary widely over short distances. The weather stations are sited to provide good geographical coverage. Their data is sent to the Bureau of Meteorology for use in weather forecasting and climate studies.\n\nIndustry uses this data for time critical agribusiness decision-making. These can range from scheduling irrigation of vegetable crops, through to choosing the right conditions for spraying operations in broad scale crops.

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>Fusarium</strong> model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

Each of these waterholes has a gauging station established by the respective state governments that is measuring stage height, this is converted into a change in storage on a daily basis. The SILO climate data is used to provide the rainfall as input and Morton's Lake evaporation as an output. The difference between the change in storage plus rainfall minus evaporation is the interactions with groundwater and the error term.",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core and the percentage of carbonate material in each sample. XRD analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

    "title": "Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 19 August 2015.",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n The dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\nThe Clarence-Moreton Asset database V6.1 supersedes the previous version (Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 11 December 2014, minor version v20150603 GUID = 248361ac-2495-4228-a4e4-e3c6cabf7433) of the Asset database. \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v6.1  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150819.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150819_GISOnly.gdb), the Water Dependant Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150819.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.

    "description": "\n<b>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</b>\nRiver and Creek Flooding \nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\n\n\n\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside. \n\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i> Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions - with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage. \n<i>Purpose</i>: To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i> Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations. <i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i> \n<i>Flood Height:</i> Indicates the\napproximate water surface level of potential inundation during a\ncomputer-modelled flood event, expressed in meters above mean sea level. This dataset\nrepresents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of\n0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i> The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is: 1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year\n<i>Likelihood: PossibleAnnual Exceedance Probability (AEP): </i><i>1%</i>\n<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 100 Year</i>\nA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but nevertheless still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.\n<i>Version Notes 3.1.0</i> - First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE. (October 2023)\n<i>Version Resolution: 2.5m</i>\n<i>Data Reliability: A </i>\n<i>Indicates the flood data is of the highest available standard and has been prepared using the most recent flood model and input data </i>\n<i>Further Information: </i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website: <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding</a>",

    "description": "The project will determine the status of threatened marine (green, hawksbill and flatback) turtles and dugongs in the Torres Strait and threats to these populations. It also will investigate links between different populations of dugongs and turtles in terms of movement and habitat use. They will also assess the abundance of dugongs in the Torres Strait using aerial surveys.\n\nWorking in conjunction with the Torres Strait Regional Authorities (TSRA) Land and Sea Unit and the TSRA Community Ranger program this project will:\n\n1. Determine the status of green turtles in Torres Strait (sex ratios, patterns of juvenile recruitment, nesting success and hatchling production) using seasonal surveys of green turtle foraging and nesting sites. Foraging sites will vary to cover as many different habitats as possible (e.g. one per year). Nesting sites will include Maizub Kaur (Bramble Cay) and Dowar Island (Mer Group)\n\n2. Determine the status of hawksbill and flatback turtles in Torres Strait by conducting Iama community and Mabuiag Community seasonal surveys and trial remote camera deployments at Sassie Island and Malu Kiai (Deliverance Island) to quantify nesting events, which are suspected to be declining, and predation levels, which are speculated to be high. Data will then be used in combination with survey data collected by QDERM (Col Limpus) since 1992, and other life history and mortality data to determine a robust account of population status.\n\n3. Investigate population connectivity of dugong and green turtles using satellite tracking of dugongs caught in the northern section of Torres Strait (i.e. around Biogu), analysis of previous tracking data (from QDERM, CRC TS, MTSRF and AMMC) of turtles and dugongs and collection of skin samples from dugongs and green turtles to strengthen the genetic understanding.\n\n4. Undertake dugong and turtle aerial surveys in March 2011 and November 2013 of western Torres Strait, including the Dugong Sanctuary and the area west of Orman Reef in association with a parallel survey of the northern GBR. \n\n5. Analyse historical data to examine patterns of turtle abundance in key areas such as western Torres Strait and the Dugong Sanctuary.",

The dataset was created using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model based on 10 vegetation-specific remote sensing datasets and 7,938 training sites of known vegetation community and condition state across Southeast Queensland, Brigalow Belt and Central Queensland Coast bioregions. Condition score was modelled as a function of distance in the remote sensing (RS) space within homogeneous vegetation communities. The product is intended to represent predicted BioCondition for 2021 rather than any singe date.",

    "description": "This data set provides fixed broadband network performance, allocated to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) boundaries from the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).\nAdditional columns have been added corresponding to the matching boundaries of the 2016 ABS Statistical Area Levels 2, 3 and 4, and the 2020 Local Government Areas. These were spatially joined using the centroid of each polygon, and therefore, should only be used as an approximation. Furthermore, grid cells residing outside of these boundaries, such as offshore or over rivers, are assigned a null value in these columns.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "Since 1993 some students have enrolled part-time . All enrolments are reported in full-time equivalent units (FTEs) and include full-time and part-time students. \nData Notes:\n\n\nDistance Education refers to enrolments in Distance Education Centres. It is separate to home learning arrangements made necessary by extraordinary circumstances such as pandemics. \n\n\nDistance education centres (DECs) provide schooling for students who are isolated or whose special circumstances prevent them from attending a regular school. They operate either as separate schools or as units within regular primary, central and high schools. Students enrolled in DECs are counted in their corresponding years of schooling. \n\n\nIn conjunction with the NSW School of Languages (formerly Open High School), DECs also provide individual subject enrolment, widening study opportunities for secondary students. These students are enrolled and counted at their home schools.\n\n\nEnrolments (FTE) in distance education are recorded mid-year.\n\n\nAll enrolments are reported in full-time equivalent units (FTE), and include full-time and part-time students whose main school is the distance education centre.\n\n\nThe FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

    "description": "    \n\n:Mean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant\ncanopy for the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far\nmore spatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of\nwater limitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and\nseasonal pattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.\nCanopy transpiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the\ntotal evaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component\nof total evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a14.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "Disjunct faunal species were defined as those with populations separated by a substantial geographic distance from other populations, such that non-flying taxa are unlikely to interbreed with other populations. These species are often evidence of past distributions or biogeographic events and therefore demonstrate past processes, as required by National Estate criterion A1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate. Vagrant species were excluded from consideration. \n\nAs is the case for flora, the fact that Tasmania is an island and its extreme southerly position in Australia mean that many faunal species are necessarily at the edge of their biogeographic range in the region or have disjunct populations across Bass Strait. \n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:500 000 scale) detailing disjunct fauna populations. Disjunct fauna polygons are given a unique code, the relevant National Estate values and criteria, and cleared land status.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\nAsset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 26 February 2016 (V2) supersedes the previous version of the SSB Asset database V1.1 (Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 18 December 2015, GUID: d7dd32e7-a0cc-4537-a280-c71f4be87e01). It contains the Asset database (SSB_asset_database_20160226.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (SSB_asset_database_20160226_GISOnly.gdb), the draft Water Dependent Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-SYD-SSB-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-v20160226.xlsx), a data dictionary (SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the Water Asset Information Tool (WAIT) process as outlined below. This version should be used for Materiality Test (M2) test.\n\nThe user needs to join the Table Assetlist  or Elementlist  to the spatial data.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Sydney regions are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Sydney bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \" SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate_\t              Notes\n\n1.0\t               3/08/2015\t        Initial database.\n\n1.1\t               18/12/2015\t         \"(1) Added 93 assets/9897elements from 18 datasets required by SSB asset workshop.\n\n                                                           (2) Fixed 22 AIDs in spatial data, which can not directly join  to relevant table in asset database\"\n\n2\t              26/02/2016             \"1) Updating for \n\n                                                              (a) Updated Group/SubGroup/Class of Platypus elements and assets to Ecological/ Vegetation/ Habitat (potential species distribution)\n\n                                                              (b)Turned off all economic elements/assets from GWMP (11), SW BWR area (40) and SW WAR area (40)\n\n                                                              (c)Add one point Economic assets from Water access licence 10CA117220 (WAL) \n\n                                                              (d)Turned off 382 GW point elements and reprocess GW point assets\n\n                                                              (e)Turned off five assets (AID: 63163,63162,63161,63160,63159)  from  GMA data  \n\n                                                              (f)Updated asset name and name rule for previous SCA assets by replacing \"(SCA Water Supply Dams)\" using \"(Sydney water supply dams)\" \n\n                                                              (g) Turn off all four assets of SCA water source areas(AID:  63567, 63568, 63569, 63570)\n\n                                                              (h) Turn off 12 assets of SCA dams.\n\n                                                         (2)Updated for M2 test results from SSB assessment team and create the draft Water Dependent Asset Register file \n\n                                                              (BA-SYD-SSB-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-v20160226.xlsx)\"\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 26 February 2016.

Each microclimate sensor device will have several climate sensors embedded inside. Sensor devices are typically installed on a street pole and locations are selected based on relevant project criteria.\n\nSince the beginning of the Microclimate Sensor Readings dataset in 2019, some sensor devices have been relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works or re-assignment to new climate projects. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical data.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with related dataset (linked below). Site_id refers to the location of the unique sensor device which may have changed over time. \n\nRelated datasets:\n<a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/microclimate-sensor-readings/information/\">Microclimate Sensor - Sensor Readings</a>",

    "title": "Hawkesbury Floodplain Risk Management Study & Plan",
    "description": "The study area of the Hawkesbury Floodplain Risk Management Study &amp; Plan comprises all\nof the Hawkesbury River and its immediate surrounds that fall within the Hawkesbury Local\nGovernment Area. It extends from Agnes Banks/Yarramundi in the south to Wisemans\nFerry in the north, representing a river distance of approximately 83 km and an area of some\n220 km2 subject to inundation in the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF). The main area of\nfocus is for the area from Agnes Banks/Yarramundi to Wilberforce, including the flood?prone\ncommunities of Richmond and Windsor (see Figure 1.2).\n\nThe Hawkesbury?Nepean catchment covers about 22,500 km2 and is one of the largest of all\ncoastal rivers in New South Wales (see Figure 1.3). It includes extensive grazing areas in\nthe south?west and large National Parks in the Blue Mountains to the north?west. Urban\ndevelopment in the catchment area includes towns such as Goulburn and Lithgow and outer\nsuburbs of western Sydney including Camden and Penrith (ERM Mitchell McCotter, 1995).\n\nMore than 40% of the total Hawkesbury?Nepean catchment  about 9,000 km2  is upstream\nof Warragamba Dam. Half of this area comes from the Wollondilly River. The Warragamba\nRiver joins the Nepean River 3.5 km below the dam. The Grose River is a major tributary\nwhich joins the Nepean at Yarramundi, after which the Nepean is known as the Hawkesbury.\nWhilst the Grose has a catchment of only 650 km2, it drains a high rainfall area and can\nhave a significant effect on flooding at Windsor. In particular, it can cause flood levels to rise\nquickly in the early part of major storms (ERM Mitchell McCotter, 1995).\n\nThe catchment area at the Windsor gauge is about 12,800 km2. South Creek joins just\ndownstream of the Windsor gauge. Whilst its catchment area of 640 km2 is virtually the\nsame as the Grose, it receives less rainfall and thus has less impact on Hawkesbury River\nflooding. At Lower Portland the Hawkesbury is joined by the Colo River, which drains an\narea of 4,640 km2 (ERM Mitchell McCotter, 1995). The Colo can influence flooding in the\nHawkesbury River depending on the movement of flood producing rainfall over the\nHawkesbury and Colo River catchments. The Colo has a shorter response time to rainfall\nand as shown in the 1978 flood, it can have a large impact on Hawkesbury River levels,\nparticularly downstream of Sackville. A study of the joint probabilities of floods originating\nfrom the Hawkesbury and the Colo has been carried out (AWACS, 1997). AWACS found\nthat the 100 year design flood levels in the Hawkesbury downstream of the Colo confluence\nwere relatively insensitive to the assumed Colo contributions. Nevertheless in some events,\nflooding in the Hawkesbury River within the lower portions of the study area can be\nsignificantly influenced by the Colo subject to the spatial and temporal distribution of the\nrainfall.\n\nWhen measured in 2000, the Hawkesbury River was subject to tidal influence up to\nYarramundi Bridge (MHL, 2005). However, the limit of tidal influence is rarely constant.\nThere are short?term cyclical changes in response to the ever?changing ocean tides, and\nchanges over long time spans according to both natural processes and artificial disturbance.\nSand extraction in the vicinity of the limit of tidal influence in the Hawkesbury River is\nreported to have caused the tidal limit to move a further 10 km upstream over the 20th\ncentury (Estuaries Branch, 2010).\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Floodplain Risk Management Plan (FRMP) showing the preferred floodplain risk\nmanagement measures for the Hawkesbury study area is presented in this chapter. The recommended measures have been selected from the range of measures discussed in\nChapter 6, after an assessment of each measures impact on flood risk, as well as\nconsideration of environmental, social, and economic factors. The recommended measures\nare presented in Table 9.1. The principal components of the Plan are presented below\naccording to priority, which is assessed on the basis of how easily (quickly) each measure\ncan be implemented and on value for money. The timing of the proposed works will depend\non Councils overall budgetary commitments, and the availability of funds from other\nsources.\n\nPRIORITISED MEASURES\n\nHigh Priority Measures\n<ul>\n<li>Item 1: Community Flood Education</li>\n<li>Item 2(a): Dual Outbound Lanes on Jim Anderson Bridge</li>\n<li>Item 2(c): Construction of Community Refuges</li>\n<li>Item 2(d): Flood Emergency Plans for Special Uses and Utilities</li>\n<li>Item 2(e): Flood Emergency Plan Templates for Caravan Parks</li>\n<li>Item 2(f): Review and Update Hawkesbury?Nepean Flood Emergency Sub Plan and\nNSW State Flood Sub Plan (Annex C)</li>\n<li>Item 2(i): Investigation of Road Duplication Options at the Eastern End of the Jim\nAnderson Bridge</li>\n<li>Item 3(a): Provision of Evacuation Risk Advice for Existing Development Proposals</li>\n<li>Item 4: A range of Town Planning Measures including revisions to the Flood Risk\nchapter of Councils DCP</li>\n</ul>\n\nMedium Priority Measures\n<ul>\n<li>Item 2(b): Enhance Emergency Management Assessment Tools</li>\n<li>Item 5: Study of Voluntary House Raising and Redevelopment Options</li>\n<li>Item 6: Assessment of a Levee and Refuge Mound for McGraths Hill</li>\n</ul>\n\nLow Priority Measures\n<ul>\n<li>Item 2(g): Provide additional crossing of South Creek</li>\n<li>Item 7: Update Flood Behaviour Data for Valley</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

The location of recaptures was documented for 916 tagged prawns in 1997 and 512 tagged prawns in 1998. Tag recapture information and commercial fishery logbook information was used to test whether red-legged banana prawns moved continuously to deeper waters or whether they moved first to deep water but then returned to shallower waters. The analysis is based on compartment models of recaptures per unit of fishing effort.",
