    "description": "The Derwent Estuary habitat project 1:25000 depicts marine habitats from Piersons Point [147 02, -43 03] to New Norfolk [147 02 , -42 42 ] from the coastline to the 40metre depth contour. The habitat types depicted in the dataset include reef, sand, seagrass, silt, silty sand and aquatic macrophytes. The data was collected through intensive field sampling from June to December 2000 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The use of underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data and a Differential GPS unit allowed for the extensive area to be surveyed. The dataset is intended to be used to fulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995.",

    "description": "These tables present a summary of employment under the Public Service Act 1999 at 31 December 2012 and during the 2012 calendar year. The data is an update of that presented in the APS Statistical Bulletin 2011-12.\r\nData becomes available at six monthly intervals — through this summary for calendar year data and through the annual State of the Service Report (SOSR) and APS Statistical Bulletin (the Bulletin). The data in these tables is sourced from the APS Employment Database (APSED), which contains data extracted from agencies’ HR systems.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Public Service Commission continues to work with agencies to improve the quality and timeliness of the data they provide to APSED. Each year extensive audits and error checking of APSED are undertaken, to ensure that sound conclusions can be drawn from the data. Through this audit process, previously published data has been updated. The June 2012 data published in SOSR and the Bulletin has been revised.\r\n\r\nAs in the Bulletin, a headcount approach is used in these tables—that is, people working part-time are aggregated with people working full-time without weighting. Data also includes inoperative staff. Employees’ classification in these tables refers to their base or substantive classification. Abbreviations used in these tables and changes to administrative arrangements for the period July to December 2012 are explained in the link below. The Explanatory Notes at Appendix 1 of the Bulletin provide definitions of terms used in these tables.\r\nThe Bulletin is available at http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-apsc/parliamentary/aps-statistical-bulletin/snapshots-december-2012",

The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset. \r\n\r\n The update was necessary in order to align the forest cover types of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013) and also to introduce an attribute containing forest category information into the dataset. The update had no impact on the Indigenous land management categories reported by the Australia's Indigenous forest estate dataset, and minimal impact on the area of forest types reported against each land management category. \r\n\r\n\tThe  Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0 dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands, and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\n\tThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and SOFR 2013. The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are: 1.\tIndigenous owned and managed; \r\n2.\tIndigenous managed; \r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and \r\n4.\tOther Special rights. \r\n These categories align with the reporting requirements for the NIFS and SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.

Samples are collected at 7:00 AM each day and relate to the previous 24 hours (e.g. timestamp of 5/1/19 07:00 was sampled between 4/1/19 07:00 and 5/1/19 07:00). Results are in milligrams per litre (mg/L). To calculate an incoming load in raw sewage, match this with wastewater inlet hourly flow for the same time period (as noted in the example).\n\n\n\nQuality parameters include: Ammonia (Ammonia as N) (mg/L), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) (mg/L), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (mg/L), Nitrate plus Nitrite (mg/L), Nitrogen (Nitrogen (total)) (mg/L).\n\n\n\nNOTE.

On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1988. For each day of sampling three resources are provided in the compressed (zipped) folder: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "The Bioregional Profile identifies a number of ecological features that are of conservation value because of the role they play in the environment of the South-west Marine Region. Key ecological features meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\n1. a species, group of species, or a community with a regionally important ecological role (e.g. a predator, prey that affects a large biomass or number of other marine species);\n\n2. a species, group of species, or a community that is nationally or regionally important for biodiversity;\n\n3. an area or habitat that is nationally or regionally important for: \na) enhanced or high productivity (such as predictable upwellings - an upwelling occurs when cold nutrient-rich waters from the bottom of the ocean rise to the surface);\nb) aggregations of marine life (such as feeding, resting, breeding or nursery areas);\nc) biodiversity and endemism (species which only occur in a specific area); or\n\n4. a unique seafloor feature, with known or presumed ecological properties of regional significance.\n\n\nKey ecological features have been identified by the Australian Government on the basis of advice from scientists about the ecological processes and characteristics of the area. A workshop held in Perth in September 2006 also contributed to this scientific advice and helped to underpin the identification of key ecological features.\n\nSixteen KEFs have been identified in the South-west Marine Region:\n\n1. Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Houtman Abrolhos Islands \n2. Perth Canyon and adjacent shelf break, and other west coast canyons \n3. Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to the west coast inshore lagoons \n4. Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to Geographe Bay \n5. Cape Mentelle upwelling \n6. Naturaliste Plateau\n7. Diamantina Fracture Zone\n8. Albany Canyons group and adjacent shelf break \n9. Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Recherche Archipelago\n10. Ancient coastline at 90-120 m depth\n11. Kangaroo Island Pool, canyons and adjacent shelf break, and Eyre Peninsula upwellings.\n12. Meso-scale eddies (points).\n13. Western demersal slope and associated fish communities.\n14. Western rock lobster.\n15. Benthic invertebrate communities of the eastern Great Australian Bight. No spatial representation available.\n16. Small pelagic fish of the South-west Marine Region. No spatial representation available.\n\n \nIn order to create a spatial representation of KEFs for the South-west Marine Region, some interpretation of the information was required. DSEWPaC has made every effort to use the best available spatial information, and best judgement on how to spatially represent the features based on the scientific advice provided. This does not preclude others from making their own interpretation of available information.Departmental Deed\nData is available on request.\nNone",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the WA public sector report 2015 - Creating opportunities is the public sector entity survey (PSES). \r\n\r\nThe 2015 PSES collected information across topics such as the application of Commissioner’s Instruction No. 7 – Code of Ethics, codes of conduct and general principles of human resource management, public interest disclosure, equal employment opportunity strategies and agency management at June 2015 or for the 2014/15 financial year. The survey was sent to chief executive officers and chief employees of public sector entities with over 20 full-time equivalents as at December 2014, including Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state. In 2015, 84 public sector entities completed the survey. \r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2015.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant entities to access online.\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2015 data.xls – individual agency responses to the PSES with a question key and response key. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2015 data.sav – individual agency responses to the PSES, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of PSES data is available in the State of the WA public sector statistical bulletin 2015. \r\n",

    "title": "East Hills Stormwater Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located within the Sydney suburb of East Hills. The study area is a small\nurban catchment centred on the East Hills Railway station, which drains through a\nstormwater pipe network to the Georges River. Much of the study area is also affected by\nflooding from the Georges River, where a series of blockwall “finger levees” have been\nconstructed to reduce flood velocities and the hazard experienced to the occupants of\nriverfront dwellings. The catchment is wholly within the Bankstown local government area.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for some 88 stormwater pits and\n83 stormwater drainage pipelines.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. The stormwater pipe\nnetwork is included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\n\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 4. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R4.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, February 20, 2011\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, February 26, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Vegetation Recruitment.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of overnight admitted mental health-related separations and bed days, with and without specialised psychiatric care by patient location. Overnight admitted patient separations refers to those separations when a patient undergoes a hospital’s formal admission process, completes an episode of care, is in hospital for more than one day and ‘separates’ from the hospital. The data spans the financial year of 2015-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collections in Australian hospitals. It includes demographic, administrative and length of stay data for each hospital separation. Clinical information such as diagnoses, procedures undergone and external causes of injury and poisoning are also recorded.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRates are directly age-standardised.\n\n\nThe analysis of bed days presented in this table excludes those separations with a length of stay greater than 365 days.\n\n\nSeparations with a care type of Newborn (without qualified days), and records for Hospital boarders and Posthumous organ procurement have been excluded.\n\n\nIt is possible for patients to have multiple separations in any given reference period.\n\n",

Agardh 1820. In need of significant beds of M. pyrifera for research much of the east coast was searched by boat. Significant stands (&gt;1/2 acre) were found at Darlington, Southerly Bottom (East North Bay), Fortesque Bay and George III Rock, (near Actaeon Island). The status of the few areas not visited was determined from anecdotal reports.",

    "description": "We propose a modest program to continue monitoring 4 of the 6 known radio magnetars in order to achieve three primary science goals. The first is to characterise magnetar outbursts over long timescales, for which tracking their rotational, flux density, and polarisation properties provide a clear view of the impulse response of their magnetic fields. Second, understanding the links between magnetars the mysterious fast radio burst phenomenon through the discovery of rare emission and propagation effects, shared spectro-temporal phenomenology, and connections to high-energy (X-ray/gamma-ray) phenomena. Lastly, our continued monitoring has enormous benefit to the wider magnetar community, providing rapid alerts to changes in activity, adding context to unusual behaviour detected by high-enery observations, and a host of supplementary science through the teams extensive collaborative networks. The project and its precursors have been running since 2007 and have contributed to 21 publications since then. We are seeking to convert the project to long-term status, thereby also carrying these investigations into the SKA era.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2008 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "The full-time apparent retention rate (ARR) measures the proportion of a cohort of full-time students that moves from one grade to the next, based on an expected rate of progression of one grade per year. It does not track individual students through their final years of secondary schooling.\nData Notes:\n\n\nThe ARR is the ratio of the total number of full-time school students in a designated year (e.g. Year 12 in 2020) divided by the total number of full-time students in a previous year (e.g. Year 7 in 2015). This would be the Year 7 to 12 apparent retention rate in 2020.\n\n\nFrom 2020, students in mainstream support classes (previously excluded from this data) are reported by their underlying grade of enrolment.  As a result, data from 2020 onwards is not directly comparable to previous years.  A separate column in the CSV files has been provided to show the 2020 retention rates with both previous and revised counting rules. 2021 retention rates use the revised counting rules.\n\n\nSupport students at Schools for specific purposes (SSPs) do not have a designated grade and therefore are not counted in the calculation of ARRs. Support students in mainstream schools have been included in the calculations from 2020 (see above). \n\n\nReporting on ARRs based on small numbers of students can lead to unreliable ARR estimates. The tables combine ABS SA4 areas to ensure the underlying number of students is sufficiently large to generate reliable estimates.\n\n\nOnly full-time students are counted in the calculation of full-time apparent retention. Part-time students are excluded.\n\n\nStudents enrolled in distance education classes are included with their appropriate grade levels. Sydney-Inner includes enrolments from Sydney Distance Education High School.\n\n\nARRs can exceed 100 per cent due to factors including student migration from interstate and overseas and between school sectors.\n\n\nNorfolk Island Central School is not included in the Apparent Retention Rate factsheet, but from 2018 to 2021 was included under NSW Government data in the ABS Schools Australia publication. This can lead to a slight difference in reported figures between Schools Australia and this dataset.\n\n\nAboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander students are identified based on responses to the school enrolment form. This information may change throughout an individual’s schooling.\n\n\nReporting by non-binary gender is not possible due to system limitations.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nApparent Retention Rate Factsheet. \nEducation Statistics and Measurement, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

The distinguishing factor is that a S19 can only exist by Ministerial approval and Gazettal and although a S19 can be created over any land it can never co-exist with private land or mining tenure. The primary purpose of a S19 is to provide a 24-month period for the interested party to organise the reserving or leasing of the area but a S19 can also be created for other reasons subject to the Minister or his delegate being satisfied it is warranted. There is provision that the Minister, or his delegate, may vary, cancel and extend the term of a S19 for a period or periods (not exceeding 2 years at a time) and this is commonly done. Any creation, variation or cancellation of a S19 must be published in the Government Gazette. The S19 will expire if is not extended.  Prior to 14 October 1995 S19s were created with an indefinite term and can only be removed by having the Minister cancel the S19.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

The mooring is located at Latitude:-35.25, Longitude:136.69. It was first deployed in June 2009.\n\nSAM8SG monitors currents due to the seasonal high density saline outflow from Spencer Gulf onto the shelf.  This outflow dominates the physical characteristics of the SAIMOS survey region during the winter period.  The strength of the outflow is thought to generate eddies through baroclinic instabilities and therefore may be a significant source of eddy kinetic energy in the SAIMOS region.",

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include Cobble, Reef, Sand, Silt, Aquatic Macrophytes, Seagrass, and Vegetated. The data was collected through intensive field sampling from March to May 2007 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The use of underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data and a Differential GPS unit allowed for the extensive area to be surveyed. The dataset is intended to be used to fulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in BreastScreen Australia for women ages 50 to 74, by age group. The national breast cancer screening program, BreastScreen Australia began in 1991. It aims to reduce illness and death from breast cancer using screening mammography for early detection of unsuspected breast cancer in women. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of women in the population aged 50-74 screened by BreastScreen Australia over 2 calendar years. The population denominator was the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 50-74 within the relevant geographical area for the relevant 2-year reporting period.\n\n\nA PHN was assigned to women using a postcode to PHN correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to a PHN and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nThe time period of some PHN data presented is prior to the initiation of PHNs, which were in established in June 2015.\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia changed its target age group from 50-69 years to 50-74 years from July 2013; participation is reported for both the previous and current target age groups to allow comparison of trends with previously reported data.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n\nPHN205 Murray includes Albury, NSW\n\n",

    "description": "A basemap image service that displays the best openly available (latest and highest spatial resolution) authoritative general reference imagery datasets captured by remotely piloted aircraft systems (drones), piloted aircraft, and satellite space craft over areas of Queensland. This basemap service is designed to provide access to the latest publicly available State Remotely Sensed Image Library collection of aerial imagery capture under the Spatial Imagery Services Program (SISP). Aerial imagery that is three years or older captured under SISP is made available for public use openly by the Department of Resources, Queensland. Satellite imagery (Planet Q3 2017 mosaic) is visible in areas over Queensland where aerial photography is unavailable. Basemap services comprise a single layer of static imagery optimised for display purposes. This service has a tile cache built down to a scale of 1:1129. The tile cache can be turned off in client software for viewing at lower scales and printing purposes, and can be used in dynamic mode to filter and display individual project areas. The projects range from 2cm to 240cm resolution. Accuracy is dependent on the individual projects. Periodical updates will be made to the service as new projects are captured. Projects are visible at scales 1:50,000, 1:250,000 and 1:25000000. The images comprised in each of the projects are orthorectified which removes the effects of image perspective (tilt) and relief (terrain) effects for the purpose of creating a planimetrically correct image. The resultant orthorectified images have a constant scale wherein features are represented in their 'true' positions. If you would like to receive updates for new projects, functionality or planned downtime please subscribe here: http://ems.gs/3qln0iYbIYQ.",

This point feature dataset is part of the Features of Interest Category Database.Children’s Hospital - A hospital specifically for the care of children.General Hospital - An institution in which the sick or injured persons are given medical or surgical treatment.Psychiatric Hospital - A hospital for the care and treatment of patients affected with acute or chronic mental illness.These point feature datasets are part of the Features of Interest Category data and all the Health-related data centroids are positioned within the cadastral parcel in which they are located.These features do not fit within one of the ten foundation spatial data themes and are therefore classified as a category. They have historically been captured by Spatial Services as part of the NSW  topographic mapping program and therefore warrant inclusion.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State\n of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department\n of Customer Service NSW).

    "description": "Traditional pulsar searching techniques are not sensitive enough to extreme pulsars such as millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in compact binaries (e.g., Pulsar-Blackhole binary systems), extremely fast spinning pulsars (e.g., sub-MSPs), and high dispersion measure (DM) pulsars. Such a situation is now changed thanks to the development of next generation radio telescope arrays such as Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). ASKAP is capable of conducting highly sensitive radio continuum surveys with wide sky coverage (e.g, Evolutionary Map of The Universe survey). One of the solutions is to find pulsar candidates in radio continuum surveys such as ASKAP surveys and then carry out targeted searches. This technique allows us to search over the wide bandwidth with full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. In this proposal, we propose to observe 16 pulsar candidates identified in the Galactic plane using new ASKAP EMU images. We found 22 candidates by selecting sources with spectral index steeper than -2.0 and compactness less than 1.2. Among them 13 are known pulsars and a reasonable number of candidates to follow up (9 sources). In total, we have 16 candidates including seven sources from 2023APRS semester. Because of the dense ionised medium in the Galactic Plane, MSPs are likely to be missed by previous pulsar surveys carried out at 1.4 GHz. Here, we propose a targeted pulsar search with the Parkes UWL which allow us to search pulsation at higher frequencies and therefore avoid strong DM smearing and scattering effects.",

    "description": "The datafile, published by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) contains the composition and abundance of airborne pollen in the suburb of Casuarina, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. The data was collected for the period between March 2004 to November 2005 as part of a large research program looking at atmospheric particles and human health (see Stevenson, J, Haberle, SG, Johnston, FH, and Bowman, DMJS, 2007, Seasonal distribution of pollen in the atmosphere of Darwin, tropical Australia: Preliminary results, Grana 46, 34-42).\nAirborne pollen counts were derived from deployment of a seven-day Hirst-type volumetric pollen and spore trap located on a rooftops at 14m above the ground. The Hirst-type sampler uses a range of adhesive surface compounds including vaseline and 10% paraffin wax in toluene on MelinexTM tape (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK), silicon-based adhesive (Lanzoni s.r.l., Bologna, Italy). The seven-day tapes are then cut into 24-hr segments and mounted on glass slides with a stain such as fuchsine stained Gelvatol. Analysis of each 24-hr period is conducted by counting four transects at 400 magnification. The data is summed to provide an average weekly pollen count.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data, acquired via the ACEAS Data Portal with permission from TERN.\n\n\nThis dataset allows you to filter the data by the date of collection.\n\n",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

SCIMS online is accessible via the Spatial portal.Metadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleNSW Positioning Theme - Survey Mark GDA2020 multiCRSContent TypeHosted Feature LayerDescriptionThis service provides GDA2020 coordinates, heights and related information for NSW survey marks that form the official State control survey network (as reported in SCIMS). This service supports requests in multiple coordinate reference systems.This service controls the precision of numerical output in a manner that mirrors SCIMS Online available through the Spatial Services Portal.The web service provides a wealth of data on each mark, including:mark type (Permanent Mark, State Survey Mark, etc.) mark number horizontal coordinates and their accuracy (class and order) heights and their accuracy (class and order) status of the mark (destroyed, restricted access, etc.)  The mark type is represented using various shapes and the accuracy of the mark (both vertical and horizontal) is communicated by the colour. This web service allows users to easily integrate survey control mark data from SCIMS into Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant spatial platforms and applications. Data provided by the NSW Survey Mark web service can be used in a variety of engineering and surveying applications, including but not limited to: cadastral survey planning flood studies and hydrographic modelling infrastructure developmentsite calibration at construction sites elevation modelling preservation of survey infrastructure.The NSW Survey Mark web service gives users an alternative method to access state control survey data that can be incorporated into their GIS package without needing to log into SCIMS Online.Please note that SCIMS Online is the official option for obtaining state control survey data for cadastral surveys as it offers legal traceability.

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a17.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are overweight or obese. Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30, or obese if their BMI was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "A geophysical survey, comprising self-potential and electromagnetic methods, was made during the 1952 and 1953 field seasons at the Labour Victory Copper Mine, about 7 miles north-north-west of the Mt. Elliott Copper Mine, near Selwyn, Northern Queensland. The self-potential survey covered an area of 2,400 feet x 900 feet, but owing to other operational commitments during the 1953 season, the electromagnetic survey was confined to the southern part of the area. The primary object of the work was to determine the extent of the mineralisation associated with the known lode, which strikes north-south through the centre of the surveyed area. The self-potential survey revealed a well-defined anomaly nearly 1,000 feet long, in the northern part of the area. The axis of this anomaly is parallel to, but about 75 feet west of, the known lode. The disused main shaft of the now idle mine is at the southern end of the anomaly, which in this vicinity deviates slightly towards the south-east, i.e. towards the known lode. No workings exist in the area of the indication, and no outcrops were found, the rock formations being hidden for the most part by alluvium. The electromagnetic results confirmed those of the self-potential survey, but the electromagnetic indication extends farther to the south. The results suggest that the indication may be caused by lenticular bodies and that these are disturbed by cross faults. No mineralised deposits were indicated by the electrical results in the southern part of the area. It is recommended that some trenching and geological and geochemical work be done in the area of the strong electrical indication. If the results of the testing show that the indication is not due to graphitic or pyritic schists, it is recommended that a number of diamond drill holes be put down. Suggested locations for five such drill holes are given. If the anomaly is due to ore the geophysical results suggest an ore body of considerable size.",

    "description": "Radiocarbon dating was used to construct an age model for the upper sections of core MD002361 to a depth of 205cm, after which the age-model was based on the chronology of Bassinot et al. as the core extends beyond the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) of SPECMAP. The age versus depth profile for this core shows a step-like pattern with increased sedimentation rates during interglacial periods and decreased rates during glacial periods. The average sedimentation rate over the length of the core is 2.5cm/1000yrs, with a high sedimentation rate illustrated during the holocene (15cm/1000yrs). It appears that the sedimentation rate may be affected by river discharge, with an increase in red-brown sediment during the interglacial periods. This is shown with an increase in sedimentation rate during MIS 5 and MIS 11. The age at the deepest part of the core (1360cm) is ~549,058yrs BP.",

The area investigated comprises approximately 115 acres, about 2 miles south of the township of Swansea in the parish of Wallarah, Country Northumberland. In the Swansea area 'test and define' core drilling by the Bureau has indicated coal reserves of approximately 302,000 tons within the physical limits required for open cut exploitation. This total is made up of more than 87,000 tons in the \"Open Cut Block\" and 215,000 tons in the \"West Block\". Proving is recommended for the open cut Block and for the West Block, except that in the latter area the obstruction which will be offered to open cutting by the presence of the P.M.G. cable should be considered before proving is undertaken.",

    "description": "We propose to undertake a pulsar survey along the Galactic Plane using the new Methanol Multibeam receiver in order to uncover pulsars previously selected against in lower frequency surveys. The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies. Simulations have shown that we expect to find a total of 200 pulsars of which about one half will be new detections.",

    "title": "AIHW - Patients Spending on Medicare - Total Out-of-pocket Cost per Patient for Non-hospital Medicare Services (PHN) 2016-2017",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with costs, the total out-of-pocket cost per patient at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile and various statistics for all patients. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nNon-hospital Medicare services are Medicare-subsidised medical services that were provided to patients who were not admitted into a hospital at the time of receiving the service. These include GP and practice nurse attendances, specialist attendances, obstetric attendances, pathology tests and collection items, diagnostic imaging, operations, assistance at operations, optometry, allied health attendances, radiotherapy and therapeutic nuclear medicine that were provided to patients not admitted into a hospital. This includes eligible telehealth services.\n\n\nTotal out-of-pocket cost per patient is the net cost to the patient for all non-hospital Medicare-subsidised health services they claim in a year, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nCosts associated with bulk-billing incentives or other top-up items are included in the analysis.\n\n\nTotal out-of-pocket cost per patient is for patients with out-of-pocket costs greater than zero.\n\n\nAll patients include all patients with out-of-pocket costs equal to, or greater than, zero.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~30cm into the core. Three samples were collected for XRD analysis; at the sediment surface (GC11-0) representing interglacial sediment, at 260cm (GC11-260) also representing interglacial sediment, and from 160cm (GC11-160) - representing glacial sediment. XRD analysis shows that the majority of the interglacial sample (GC11-260) carbonate is made up of calcite. The glacial sample (GC11-160) is only 50% CaCO3 with the rest of the sample made up of quartz and clays.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who have a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally for all births, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who had a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally, divided by the number of females who gave birth vaginally, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nBirths included are vaginal births, including non-instrumental and instrumental births.\n\n\nBirths excluded are caesarean sections.\n\n\nThird-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in second-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal sphincter, rectrovaginal septum, and sphincter not otherwise specified. Excludes laceration involving the anal or rectal mucosa. A fourth-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in third-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal mucosa and rectal mucosa.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nData for SA3 of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

Two time periods are provided in the south west agricultural zone only where the Land Monitor index can be more confidently applied, these time periods are 1990-current year and the last 10 years. The summaries are statistical measures of mean, linear trend over time, quadratic trend over time, standard deviation about mean, residual standard deviation after fitting linear trend and residual standard deviation after fitting linear and quadratic trends. The statistical summaries can be displayed separately or together to summarise trends and stability of vegetation over time as measured by the Land Monitor vegetation index, and in particular to highlight areas with different patterns of change.\n\nClick <a href=\"https://data.wa.gov.au/land-monitor\">here</a> for more information.",

    "title": "AIHW - Maternity Indicators - Episiotomy for Women having First Birth for Instrumental Vaginal Births (%) (SA3) 2014-2016",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who had an episiotomy when giving birth for the first time and giving birth vaginally and instrumentally, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their first baby who had an episiotomy during an instrumental vaginal birth, divided by the number of females having their first baby who gave birth vaginally and had an instrumental vaginal birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth for the first time and had a vaginal birth, with or without instruments. Females who had a multiple birth are included if this was the first time they had given birth.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who did not give birth for the first time or gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nInstrumental vaginal birth means that the baby was delivered with the use of forceps or vacuum extraction.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, a combined laceration and episiotomy value could be recorded; from 2014 onwards, episiotomy could be recorded separately.\n\n\nData were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The data in this file summarises the electricity consumption and generation as daily usage. The time period associated with each day has been converted to a UTC time zone. This data set allows year on year comparison or daily usage against atmospheric changes i.e. temperature variance, rainfall.

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) route segments for the year of 2021. Route segments are a public transport link between two adjacent activity nodes or other network nodes. A numbered public transport route is usually made up of a sequence of consecutive route segments\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity) \n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility. \nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Activity Nodes (Point) 2021\" or \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Areas (SA1) 2021\". Some routes are composed of disjoint line segments and as such the data should be used for visualisation purposes only.\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website. A full list of SNAMUTS publications can be found at http://www.snamuts.com/publications.html.",

    "description": "It is the responsibility of the fire control authority to assign low or high fire ratings to areas of land under Part 8 Section 80 of the Electricity Safety Act 1998. These ratings are used in conjunction with the Electricity Safety (Electric Line Clearance) Regulations 2020, the Electricity Safety (Installations) Regulations 2019 and the Electricity Safety (Bushfire Mitigation) Regulations 2013, to prescribe low or high bushfire risk areas.\nThis dataset defines areas of low fire hazard rating. Areas that are not covered by this layer are rated as having a high fire hazard rating for the purposes of the Electricity Safety Act 1998.\nCouncils that fall entirely within the former Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB) area have been rated as low fire hazard.  In the data layer we refer to these councils as \"undefined\".\nLow fire hazard rating areas are usually restricted to irrigated areas and towns where block sizes are small and well maintained. Examples of these are as follows: high density residential areas (i.e. property sizes of up to 0.25ha); industrial and commercial urban areas; high moisture crops (i.e. market gardens); irrigated farmland (but not seasonally irrigated as it must remain irrigated over summer); vineyards; golf courses and sporting ovals (permanently green).\nHigh fire hazard rating areas are defined as any areas not covered by the low hazard rating areas. These areas are said to contain sufficient fuel on the ground to carry a fire. \nHazardous bushfire risk area (HBRA) as defined by the Act, means an area assigned a fire hazard rating of ‘high’.  Low bushfire risk area (LBRA) deemed to mean areas assigned a fire hazard rating of ‘low’.\nFurther detailed information about the Electric Line Vegetation Clearance Project, please visit the following site: \nhttps://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/plan-prepare/building-planning-regulations/electric-line-vegetation-clearance",

    "description": "This data was collected in May and June 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022009 Leg 2.\n\nDeparted:  Nuku'Alofa, Tonga, May 28, 2009\nArrived: \tLautoka Fiji, June 25, 2009\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The West Australian Mooring Sub-Facility is part of the Australian National Mooring Network. \n\nThe Western Australia moorings sub-facility is responsible for a collection of moorings designed to monitor variability in the Leeuwin Current and continental shelf currents both in terms of along-shore and cross-shore variability. Moorings in the region also monitor processes within the Perth Canyon. The time-series monitoring of physical and biological parameters provided by these moorings supplements past and current research activities in the region based at the CSIRO, the Department of Fisheries WA and Western Australian Universities. The sub-facility currently maintains six regional moorings (two recently decommissioned) and two National Reference Stations (one recently retrieved and not redeployed).\n \nThe regional moorings are located off Perth, clustered near the Perth Canyon and the Two Rocks Line. The Two Rocks Line contains four moorings which transect the continental shelf north of Perth from the 44m to the 500m isobath (the 50m mooring was decommissioned in May 2013, and the 150m mooring in October 2013). Around the Perth Canyon, there remains one shelf mooring in shallower water at the head of the canyon, formerly two slope moorings were located near the 500m isobath (decommissioned in July 2010 and March 2014), to monitor processes in and around the canyon. Primarily these moorings are thermistor strings allowing the structure of the Leeuwin Current to be determined. Two of the moorings also sample biogeochemical parameters.",

    "description": "Bush Fire Prone Land is mapped within a local government area, which becomes the trigger for planning for bush fire protection. Bush Fire Prone Land mapping is intended to designate areas of the State that are considered to be higher bush fire risk for development control purposes. Not being designated bush fire prone is not a guarantee that losses from bush fires will not occur.The NSW Bush Fire Prone Land dataset is a map prepared in accordance with the Guide for Bush Fire Prone Land Mapping (BFPL Mapping Guide) and certified by the Commissioner of NSW RFS under purposes of Section 10.3 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 No 203.\n\nOver time there has been various releases of the BFPL Mapping Guide, in which the categories and types of vegetation included in the BFPL map have changed. The version of the guide under which, each polygon or LGA was certified is contained in the data. An area of land that can support a bush fire or is likely to be subject to bush fire attack, as designated on a bush fire prone land map.\n\nThe definition of bush fire vegetation categories under guideline version 5b: * Vegetation Category 1 consists of: &gt; Areas of forest, woodlands, heaths (tall and short), forested wetlands and timber plantations. <i>HEX code: #FF0000</i>* Vegetation Category 2 consists of: &gt;Rainforests. &gt;Lower risk vegetation parcels. These vegetation parcels represent a lower bush fire risk to surrounding development and consist of: - Remnant vegetation; - Land with ongoing land management practices that actively reduces bush fire risk. <i>HEX code: #</i><i>FFD200</i>* Vegetation Category 3 consists of: &gt; Grasslands, freshwater wetlands, semi-arid woodlands, alpine complex and arid shrublands. <i>HEX code: #</i><i>FF8000</i>* Buffers are created based on the bushfire vegetation, with buffering distance being 100 metres for vegetation category 1 and 30 metres for vegetation category 2 and 3. <i>HEX code: #</i><i>FFFF73</i>\n\nVegetation excluded from the bushfire vegetation categories include isolated areas of vegetation less than one hectare, managed lands and some agricultural lands. Please refer to BFPL Mapping Guide for a full list of exclusions.\n\nThe legislative context of this dataset is as follows: On 1 August 2002, the Rural Fires and Environmental Assessment Legislation Amendment Act 2002 (Amendment Act) came into effect. The Act amended both the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and the Rural Fire Services Act 1997 to ensure that people, property and the environment are more fully protected against the dangers that may arise from bushfires. Councils are required to map bushfire prone land within their local government area, which becomes the trigger for the consideration of bushfire protection measures when developing land. BFPL Mapping Guidelines are available from www.rfs.nsw.gov.au\n\n<a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/4412/Guideline-for-Councils-to-Bushfire-Prone-Area-Land-Mapping.pdf\">http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/4412/Guideline-for-Councils-to-Bushfire-Prone-Area-Land-Mapping.pdf</a>",

    "title": "Victorian Land Use Information System 2016-2017",
    "description": "The Victorian Land Use Information System (VLUIS) 2016/17 dataset has been created by the Spatial Information Sciences Group of the Agriculture Victoria Research in the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport, and Resources. It covers the entire landmass of Victoria and separately describes the land tenure, land use and land cover across the state at the cadastral parcel level.\n\nThe methodology for creating the VLUIS is described in Morse-McNabb et al. (2015) with the following notable changes:\n1. Land use data provided by the Office of the Valuer-General of Victoria for the 2014 year has been used as a base input. Readily available sources of land use information from government and industry have been used to provide updates to the land tenure and land use components of the 2016/17 dataset. The source dataset and source date are recorded for each parcel. The land cover mapping method remains unchanged to previous versions of the VLUIS.\n2. The Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification, version 8, has been added to the attribute table. The VLUIS land use code fields have been translated across to the ALUM classification. Version 8 has been used you can find the ALUM Classification on the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources ABARES ALUM page: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification. \n3. Land parcels within urban areas, mapped in previous versions, have been masked out and have been renamed as Built Up Areas vastly reducing the size of the 2016/17 dataset. Land cover for Built Up Areas (LC_CODE = BUILT) is listed as null.\n4. Road reserves and road parcels have been merged together and renamed Voids. Land cover for Voids (LC_CODE = VOID) is listed as null.\n5. Parcels &lt;12.5 hectares: land cover has not been attributed as the resolution of MODIS cannot support classifications of polygons smaller than 12.5 hectares.\n\nThe data is in the form of an ESRI feature class. \n\nTo use the VLUIS data correctly it is important to understand the difference between the three components of VLUIS. The Guidelines for land use mapping in Australia: principles, procedures and definitions, Edition 3 published in 2006 by the Commonwealth of Australia, defines them as follows: \nLand tenure is the form of an interest in land. Some forms of tenure (such as pastoral leases or nature conservation reserves) relate directly to land use and land management practice. \nLand use means the purpose to which the land cover is committed. Some land uses, such as agriculture, have a characteristic land cover pattern. These usually appear in land cover classifications. Other land uses, such as nature conservation, are not readily discriminated by a characteristic land cover pattern. For example, where the land cover is woodland, land use may be timber production or nature conservation. \nLand cover refers to the physical surface of the earth, including various combinations of vegetation types, soils, exposed rocks and water bodies as well as anthropogenic elements, such as agriculture and built environments. Land cover classes can usually be discriminated by characteristic patterns using remote sensing.\n\nA metadata statement, for the VLUIS product, and ESRI symbology files for the data can be freely downloaded from the VLUIS project page on the Victorian Resources Online website: http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/vluis\n\nDOI 10.26279/5b96043f7bd02",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The Sydney Harbour catchment area includes a number of different river systems which drain into the Port Jackson estuary. During high rainfall events the catchment areas behave differently to deliver contaminants into the Port Jackson estuary. Under conditions of high rainfall contaminants are delivered to areas very quickly as freshwater slides over the top of the denser more saline waters of the estuary. Secchi Disc samples were taken along the Port Jackson estuary over four days to determine the behaviour of the freshwater plume as it travels in a layer of freshwater to be flushed or flocculate out at some point in the estuary.",

    "title": "Household Travel Survey",
    "description": "Household Travel Survey (HTS) is the most comprehensive source of personal travel data for the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area (GMA). This data explores average weekday travel patterns for residents in Sydney GMA.\nThe Household Travel Survey (HTS) collects information on personal travel behaviour. The study area for the survey is the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area (GMA) which includes Sydney Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA), parts of Illawarra and Hunter regions. All residents of occupied private dwellings within the Sydney GMA are considered within scope of the survey and are randomly selected to participate.\nThe HTS has been running continuously since 1997/981 and collects data for all days through the year – including during school and public holidays.\nTypically, approximately 2,000-3,000 households participate in the survey annually. Data is collected on all trips made over a 24-hour period by all members of the participating households.\nAnnual estimates from the HTS are usually produced on a rolling basis using multiple years of pooled data for each reporting year2. All estimates are weighted to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Estimated Resident Population, corresponding to the year of collection3. Unless otherwise stated, all reported estimates are for an average weekday.\nDue to disruptions in data collection resulting from the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, post-COVID releases of HTS data are based on a lower sample size than previous HTS releases. To ensure integrity of the results and mitigate risk of sampling errors some post-COVID results have been reported differently to previous years. Please see below for more information on changes to HTS post-COVID (2020/21 onwards).\n\n\nData collection for the HTS was suspended during lock-down periods announced by the NSW Government due to COVID-19.\n\n\nExceptions apply to the estimates for 2020/21 which are based on a single year of sample as it was decided not to pool the sample with data collected pre-COVID-19.  \n\n\nHTS population estimates are also slightly lower than those reported in the ABS census as the survey excludes overseas visitors and those in non-private dwellings.\n\n\nChanges to HTS post-COVID (2020/21 onwards)\nHTS was suspended from late March 2020 to early October 2020 due to the impact and restrictions of COVID-19, and again from July 2021 to October 2021 following the Delta wave of COVID-19. Consequently, both the 2020/21 and 2021/22 releases are based on a reduced data collection period and smaller samples.\nDue to the impact of changed travel behaviours resulting from COVID-19 breaking previous trends, HTS releases since 2020/21 have been separated from pre-COVID-19 samples when pooled. As a result, HTS 2020/21 was based on a single wave of data collection which limited the breadth of geography available for release. Subsequent releases are based on pooled post-COVID samples to expand the geographies included with reliable estimates.\nDisruption to the data collection during, and post-COVID has led to some adjustments being made to the HTS estimates released post-COVID:\nSA3 level data has not been released for 2020/21 and 2021/22 due to low sample collection.\nLGA level data for 2021/22 has been released for selected LGAs when robust Relative Standard Error (RSE) for total trips are achieved\nMode categories for all geographies are aggregated differently to the pre-COVID categories\nPurpose categories for some geographies are aggregated differently across 2020/21 and 2021/22.\nA new data release – for six cities as defined by the Greater Sydney Commission - is included since 2021/22.\nPlease refer to the Data Document for 2022/23 (PDF, 262.54 KB) for further details.\nRELEASE NOTE\nThe latest release of HTS data is 15 May 2025.  This release includes Region, LGA, SA3 and Six Cities data for 2023/24. Please see 2023/24 Data Document for details.\nA revised dataset for LGAs and Six Cities for HTS 2022/23 data has also been included in this release on 15 May 2025. If you have downloaded HTS 2022/23 data by LGA and/or Six Cities from this link prior to 15/05/2025, we advise you replace it with the revised tables. If you have been supplied bespoke data tables for 2022/23 LGAs and/or Six Cities, please request updated tables.\nRevisions to HTS data may be made on previously published data as new sample data is appended to improve reliability of results. Please check this page for release dates to ensure you are using the most current version or create a subscription (https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/subscriptions) to be notified of revisions and future releases.",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052009.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, Australia, October 16, 2009\nArrived:  \tSydney, Australia, October 26, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",
