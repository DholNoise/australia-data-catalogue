    "description": "A round 1.4m yellow buoy has been deployed in the Heron Island lagoon as part of the sensor network infrastructure at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, a spread-spectrum radio for communicating with the on-reef wireless network, a GPS and initially a surface mounted (30cm under the water surface) thermistor.\n\nThe float is moored in the lagoon of Heron Island in around 3m of water and will be used to monitor the flow of water through the lagoon. It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "title": "Significance of Halimeda bioherms to the global carbonate budget based on a geological sediment budget for the Northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia",
    "description": "Since the correlation between carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures was established in the ice core records, quantifying the components of the global carbon cycle has become a priority with a view to constraining models of the climate system. The link between the marine carbonate budget and atmospheric CO2 levels draws attention to the fact that this budget is still not adequately quantified. \n\nIt is widely accepted that the calcareous green alga Halimeda is a prominent contributor of carbonate to reef sediment facies in the tropics, however, Halimeda bioherms remain one of the main reservoirs of unaccounted for carbonate. In fact, it has been suggested that Halimeda bioherms on the shelf of the Northern Great Barrier Reef may contain an equal or greater volume of carbonate than the reefs themselves.\n\nHere we attempt to determine the quantitative relationship between Halimeda bioherm and coral reef derived carbonate accumulated during the Holocene on the outer shelf of the Northern Great Barrier Reef Province using data from seismic profiles, reef drill cores and Halimeda bioherm piston and vibrocore cores from the published literature. \n\nThe methodology used is detailed in the document availble for download through this record.\n\nCalculations reveal that the ribbon reefs of the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions cover areas of approximately 18.5 and 20.5 km2 and comprise approximately 0.52 and 0.92 Gt CaCO3 respectively. The Halimeda bioherms of the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions cover areas of approximately 184 and 118 km2 and comprise approximately 2.06 and 0.86 Gt CaCO3 respectively. \n\nThus, that ratio of ribbon reef to Halimeda bioherm CaCO3 is approximately 1:4 and 1:1 for the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions respectively. If we assume that the carbonate content of the Lizard Island region bioherms ranges from 20 to 90 %, we estimate that the mass balance of Halimeda bioherm CaCO3 is between 0.55 and 2.5 Gt. The ratio of ribbon reef to Halimeda bioherms CaCO3 may vary between 1:1 to 1:5 depending on the carbonate content of the Lizard Island bioherms.",

    "description": "\n<strong>Overview</strong>\nPCTs are spatial polygons that define the type and extent of known vegetation communities within the ACT <code>pctCode</code> . PCTs have been further stratified into 'zones'&nbsp;<code>pctZone</code>, which reflect the ecological condition of PCTs relative to benchmark thresholds. The ecological condition of a vegetation community, or a&nbsp;'zone' <code>pctZone</code>, is assessed using the attributes that define Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and the ACT Nature Conservation Act 2014 (NC Act). Condition zones can be used to identify sites of high quality for conservation protection (e.g. nature reserve) and candidate sites for offsetting. PCTs can also be used to interrogate the spatial distribution and condition of all mapped vegetation areas across the ACT, and are employed as stocktake, planning and on-ground management units to inform the delivery of conservation, restoration and land development programs.\n<strong>ACT plant community types</strong>\nNaturally occurring native plant community types in the ACT are drawn from Sharp (2007), as implemented in the ACT Vegetation Database (2015), and Armstrong (2013). Each community type is identified by a number, e.g., ACT01, ACT25, known as native vegetation codes (<code>pctCode</code>). Non-naturally occurring plant communities such as exotic plantations and native plantings have been assigned numbers not present in Sharp (2007), e.g., ACT65, ACT66, ACT 99. Vegetation communities from Armstrong have been assigned an ACT prefix, while retaining the Armstrong numbering, e.g., ACT152 = u152, ACT118 = u118. Refer to Appendix A for the current list of plant communities in the ACT.\n<strong>Determining pre-1750 plant community type</strong>\nPCTs reflect the most likely plant community found prior to European colonisation, except for where they are plantings or plantations. Disturbances caused by agricultural practices and abandonment of land practices can obscure the pre-colonised state. The determination of the most likely pre-European plant community found at a present-day site is informed by signs such as the presence and type of native species; the growth form and density of remnant canopy trees; the presence of stags or stumps; the presence and species of midstorey shrubs and trees; the floristic composition of the groundstorey; landscape position and other geographical features such as elevation, aspect, soils, apparent hydrology etc.\n<strong>Mapping PCTs and ecological condition zones</strong>\nThe boundaries of each PCT at a site are accurately mapped on-ground by walking the boundaries and recording them using hand-held GPS and marking directly on to high resolution orthorectified aerial photograph field maps. Once PCTs are mapped, a further assessment of condition is undertaken by dividing a PCT into homogenous&nbsp;'zones'&nbsp;<code>pctZone</code> based on the structure (presence or absence of mature canopy and regeneration), floristic composition (ground story dominance and forb diversity) and overall quality&nbsp;('intactness') of the vegetation. A simple matrix based on the criteria for conservation protection under the EPBC or NC Acts is used to categorise the condition of PCTs of grasslands (Table 1) and woodlands (Table 2 and 3). Although initially used to identify TECs for protection and/or offsetting, PCT zoning has been extended to other plant communities in the ACT and is considered a general measure of condition. There are currently 32 recognised ACT PCTs. To date, not all have been spatially mapped, with efforts focused on TECs facing higher threats at lower elevations, which are more likely to meet EPBC and NC Act status.\nGrasslands and woodland/forest PCTs are assessed using different zone criteria. Note: The <strong>zone classifications are based on threatened grassland and lowland woodland community structural and floristic condition and may therefore not reflect non-threatened communities as accurately.&nbsp;</strong>Two components are used to assess the condition of grasslands: ground layer nativeness and forbs; whereas woodlands have four components, due to the additional components of mature trees and regeneration of tree species. The highest condition scores end in the numeral one (e.g. PCT 1.1 or PCT 16.1.1). Table 4 contains a worked example to interpret condition zones for Box-Gum Grassy Woodlands. Note that the highest condition zone does not represent a pristine environment, but one that meets baseline listing criteria.\nPlease also see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e6f060330ca14473a1d6f9454a500bea\">ACT PCT Code</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6250864b1d7242ca90ecfccc9065e170\">Zone Lookup</a>&nbsp;Tables\n<strong>Woodland zone matrix</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Woodland</strong>\nMature Trees +\nMature Tree –\nRegen +\nRegen –\nRegen +\nRegen –\nNative Cover+\nForb Div. +\n16.1.1*\n16.1.3*\n16.2.1*\n16.2.3*\nForb Div. –\n16.1.2*\n16.1.4*\n16.2.2*\n16.2.4\nNative Cover–\nForb Div. +\n16.3.1'\n16.3.3'\n16.4.1\n16.4.3\nForb Div. –\n16.3.2'\n16.3.4'\n16.4.2\n16.4.4\n<strong>Grassland zone matrix</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Grassland</strong>\nGroundstory Dominance\nNative Forb Diversity\nPCT Zone\nEPBC of NC Act definition\nNative Cover+\nForb Div. ++ (High - Very High)\n1.1\nEPBC, NC\nForb Div. + (Mod - High)\n1.2\nEPBC\nNative Cover &gt;50% Themeda, Poa OR Carex\n1.2\nEPBC\nForb Div. – (Low)\n1.3\n&nbsp;\nNative Cover–\nForb Div. + (Mod)\n1.4\n&nbsp;\nForb Div. – (Low)\n1.4&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nTable 1 Vegetation zone designations for grassland communities&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Groundstorey dominance</strong>\n<strong>Native Forb Diversity</strong>\n<strong>PCT Condition Zone</strong>\n<strong>Type of exotic dominance</strong>\n<strong>EPBC or NC Act</strong>\n<strong>(if relating to PCT01)</strong>\n<strong>Native</strong>\n&nbsp;\nCover of all native understorey plants is greater than the cover of perennial exotics plants\nAt least 12 non-grass native species <strong>OR </strong>At least 3 indicator species <strong>OR</strong> Floristic Value Score more than equal to 6.5\nPCT .1\n_\nEPBC, NC\nFloristic Value Score more than equal to 5 but &lt;

Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile.

    "description": "The __Water for Fodder__ program is part of the Australian Government's Drought Response, Resilience and Preparedness Plan.\r\n\r\nUnder the program, 40 gigalitres of water was produced from the Adelaide Desalination Plant and an equivalent amount released upstream from the River Murray.\r\n\r\nFarmers in the southern connected Murray–Darling Basin were able to apply to purchase South Australian River Murray water (Trading Zone 12) at a discounted rate. The water had to be used to grow fodder and pasture. This helped farmers to maintain their breeding stock during the drought.\r\n\r\n__Round 1__ of the program opened on 11 December 2019 and due to over-subscription, closed on 13 December 2019. Under round 1, 800 parcels of 50 megalitres of water were available at $5,000 ($100 per megalitre).\r\n\r\nFollowing the review of Round 1 and consultation with South Australia, the Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia, the Hon. Keith Pitt MP, has announced that there will not be a second round of the Water for Fodder program. \r\n\r\nRemaining funding will be redirected to other programs that benefit farmers and communities in the Murray–Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nWhile Round 1 was successful, more water is available in the southern Basin due to autumn rainfall. This has reduced the need for a second round as an emergency drought response. \r\n\r\nRead more about the Water for Fodder Program here: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs/basin-wide/water-for-fodder",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2020)* is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia’s Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nAustralia’s National Forest Inventory has previously used the four derived category combinations of Dillon et al. (2015) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/IndigenousForestEstate_20150828_v1.0.0.pdf) for reporting the Indigenous estate in *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2013* and *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2018*. These four categories combined in various ways the individual attributes of the Indigenous estate, with an area of land or forest being allocated to only one of the four categories. However, the categories did not allow separate reporting on Indigenous ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.​\r\n\r\nThe methodology described in Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/publications/indigenous-estate-report) disentangles the four categories of Dillon et al. (2015), and allows separate reporting of each of Indigenous ownership of land or forest, Indigenous management or co‑management of land or forest, and land or forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have other special rights. Separate spatial coverages were created for each of these attributes, and this new dataset can form the basis for subsequent reporting on the relationships between Indigenous peoples and land or forest.\r\n\r\nThe methods and data in this data package use the same sources of data used for assembling the *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* spatial dataset, but presents the information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes ownership, management of co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology of Jacobsen et al. (2020). The Indigenous land dataset is also combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset.​ The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the *Australia's State of the Forests Report* Series. Further information can be found on the Forests Australia website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/sofr-2018",

    "title": "Mammals Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective delivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are influenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1\", and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\" response. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time performance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for March 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "title": "Parent record: Water exchange processes between Jervis Bay and shelf waters",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe third of these six experiments was designed to monitor the exchange of water between the bay and the shelf. The data collection spanned one year from April 1989 to April 1990, in order to get an indication of seasonal variability in the flow. Throughout the 12 month period, 3 current meter moorings, a separate tide gauge mooring and a meteorological station were maintained. \n\nTypical mooring deployments were 2 months with inter-deployment gaps of 1 or 2 days. Moorings were re-deployed in nominally the same location, although these varied slightly. Two moorings were maintained in the bay entrance, one off Point Perpendicular and one off Bowen Island, each containing two current meters. A third mooring was in 100m water depth, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular and this mooring housed 3 current meters and a tide gauge. A separate tide gauge was maintained in a mooring in 10m of water, 200m off Bowen Island, inside the bay. [Given that meteorological data collected from the station on Governor Head bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There are four subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n089f8080-c897-11dc-85f3-00188b4c0af8\na2c0a820-c576-11dc-b888-00188b4c0af8\nd03f0f00-c47a-11dc-9a66-00188b4c0af8\ne4eaf410-d469-11dc-9644-00188b4c0af8",

    "description": "A round 1.4m yellow buoy has been deployed in the Heron Island lagoon as part of the sensor network infrastructure at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, a spread-spectrum radio for communicating with the on-reef wireless network, a GPS and initially a surface mounted (30cm under the water surface) thermistor.\n\nThe float is moored in the lagoon of Heron Island in around 3m of water and will be used to monitor the flow of water through the lagoon. It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "title": "Australian Government Water Recovery Programs in the Murray-Darling Basin - 2010-2019",
    "description": "To return the Murray–Darling river system to health, the Murray–Darling Basin Plan requires recovery of surface water and groundwater for the environment. The government has prioritised infrastructure investment as its preferred method of water recovery. Read more about water programs in the Murray-Darling Basin here: <http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs>http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\nThis data set provides farm-level data on projects funded to recover water under the Basin Plan. Programs included are:\r\n\r\n* Commonwealth On-Farm Further Irrigation Efficiency Program (contributes to Efficiency Measures)\r\n\r\n* QLD Healthy Headwaters Water Use Efficiency Project\r\n\r\n* NSW Irrigated Farm Modernisation\r\n\r\n* NSW Basin Pipe\r\n\r\n* Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project Two\r\n\r\n* On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Operators Program in NSW\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Program for South Australia\r\n\r\n* South Australia River Murray Sustainability Program\r\n\r\n* Victorian Farm Modernisation Program\r\n\r\nFarm-level data is not available for the following programs:\r\n\r\n* Goulburn Murray Water Connections \r\n\r\n* NSW Metering Pilot\r\n\r\n* NSW Southern Valleys Metering Project\r\n\r\n* Sunraysia Modernisation Program\r\n\r\n##Exclusions\r\nPrograms that purchase water entitlements directly without associated infrastructure works are not included. Additionally, projects where a water entitlement has __not__ been returned to the Commonwealth, for example environmental projects, are also excluded.\r\n\r\n#Data field descriptions\r\n* Program: Text - Name of program under which the on-farm works were funded.\r\n\r\n* Round: Numerical or text - Funding round under which on-farm works were funded. Text fields generally refer to \"Not applicable\" where the program did not have funding rounds, or \"Pilot\" where funding was provided under a pilot arrangement.\r\n\r\n* Delivery partner: Text - The organisation contracted to deliver the program on behalf of the Australian Government. These organisations are responsible for day-to-day management of on-farm projects, and have the contract with the farmer.\r\n\r\n* Project identifier: Numerical or text - An identifier for each project unique to that program. \r\n\r\n* Australian Government project funding (GST exclusive): Currency - Australian dollars - Australian Government Project Funding excludes both GST payments and administration components of funding. Project values may change over time as the project is finalised and subject to final audit and acquittal.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML nominal): Numeric - Megalitres - Water transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Total water savings may exceed those returned to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML LTAAY): Numeric - Megalitres in LTAAY terms - LTAAY stands for Long Term Average Annual Yield, which is a method used to standardise the calculation of expected water recoveries in the Murray–Darling Basin from different water access entitlement categories and across catchments in the Basin. This measure of water volume is relevant for measuring progress of water recovery towards meeting the sustainable diversion limits set out in the Basin Plan. The average annual yield for Murray-Darling Basin resource units is calculated using the current long-term diversion limit equivalent factors (v2.05) agreed by the Ministerial Council in November 2011, or in the absence of a factor, is modelled by the MDBA in consultation with the States. Following accreditation of the Water Resource Plans for an area, the planning assumptions used within will determine the LTAAY. \r\n\r\n* Water entitlement class: Text - The type of water that was transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Water entitlements are perpetual or ongoing entitlement to exclusive access to a share of water from a specified consumptive pool as defined in the relevant water plan. The nature and names for water entitlements differ across the Murray-Darling Basin. Further information is available at: <http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml>http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml.\r\n\r\n* State: Text - State from which the water entitlement was sourced.\r\n\r\n* SDL Resource Unit: Text - The geographical location from which the water entitlement was sourced, based on information provided by the delivery partner. Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) Resource Units are defined in legislation and available at <https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160>https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160.\r\n\r\n* Description of project: Text - Description of on-farm works undertaken. This field has been edited to ensure that it has been appropriately de-identified consistent with our obligations under the _Privacy Act 1988_.\r\n\r\n* Project  commencement date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project commenced. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as the date Funding Agreement with the Delivery Partner was signed.\r\n\r\n* Project completion date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project was completed. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as approval date of final activity report, sub-project type closure report or closure letter. Not all projects have been completed at the time of producing this report.\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer: The Australian Government acting through the Department of Agriculture has exercised due care and skill in preparing and compiling this data. In some instances, the department has relied on the delivery agent - which is responsible for the management and implementation of the program (and has the contract with the individual farmer) - to prepare the data. Notwithstanding, the Department of Agriculture, its employees and advisers disclaim all liability, including liability for negligence and for any loss, damage, injury, expense or cost incurred by any person as a result of accessing, using or relying on any of the data to the maximum extent permitted by law._",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for a 1 year period between November 1988 and October 1989 inclusive. Individual measurements have been converted so that the yearly trend of wind speed and direction can be seen. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The experiment was part of a larger study looking at the relationship between neighbouring males and females in this species. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin. Fieldwork was conducted yearly in 18 plots (4mx4m) from November-January in 2002-2006.\n\nAll individuals within the plots were caught and carapace widths measured. This allowed the sex ratio in relation to size to be determined. The location of burrows were also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\nResults indicate that an average of 7 crabs per square metre were active on the surface at any time. The sex ratio was strongly male biased, with only 30% of crabs being female. The sex ratio also changed with size; females were significantly rarer in large size classes.",

    "description": "##Description\r\nThis dataset shows the annual landed catch (meaning the catch that is landed at port) in kilograms, by species and fishery, for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \r\nThese data come from AFMA catch disposal records (CDRs), and have been recorded and submitted to AFMA by commercial fishers and fish receiver permit holders when fish are landed at port. Fish discarded at sea are not included in CDRs and therefore are not included in this dataset. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThese annual catches are calculated from the date the fish was landed at a port. This means that comparisons with other datasets with different summations (for example, catch by fishing season or catch from the date the fish were removed from the ocean) may produce different results.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect catches each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as: total allowable catch, closures of fishing areas, reducing boat numbers, or banning the catch of a particular species. Similarly, changes in market demand can affect which species are targeted. \r\nCDRs are used to monitor quota (see Individual Transferable Quota)). AFMA total allowable catches (TAC)s are set for fishing seasons rather than calendar years. See catchwatch for seasonal catch to date compared to TAC for AFMA’s larger quota fisheries. Not all fisheries have CDRs, and in some fisheries the CDR program was started part-way through an annual time-period.\r\nThese catch disposal record data do not include catch by gear type. This information can be found in the “Reported landed annual catch from Commonwealth fisheries logbooks” and its metadata, which is published on data.gov.au. Note that catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only that have been recorded by fishers while at sea. It is used in combination with gear, effort, and spatial data from logbooks to inform stock assessments. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers and fish receivers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness, and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "An International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis, produced daily on an operational basis at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology using optimal interpolation (OI) on a regional 1/12 degree grid over the Australian region (20N - 70S, 60E - 170W). This Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA) v1.0 system blends infra-red SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA and METOP polar-orbiting satellites, microwave SST observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2) on GCOM-W, and in situ data from ships, and drifting and moored buoys from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS).  \n\nAll SST observations are filtered for those values suspected to be affected by diurnal warming by excluding cases which have experienced recent surface wind speeds of below 6 m/s during the day and less than 2 m/s during the night, thereby resulting in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free of diurnal warming effects.",

    "title": "Amphibians Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for November 1988. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents key results from a national survey of 1,585 recreational boat operators about their vessel biofouling management actions. The purpose was to inform a national communication approach to reducing the risk of marine pest translocation via biofouling of recreational boats in the Australian marine environment. \r\n\r\n Biofouling is a term for the growth on a boat's hull that can move invasive pests and diseases from one marine environment to another, which is a biosecurity risk. \r\n\r\n Australia's national approach to domestic marine pest biosecurity relies on voluntary uptake of the national biofouling management guidelines by recreational vessel operators, to prevent and manage biofouling growth. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The study found that a large proportion of recreational boat operators already undertake a range of effective biofouling management actions on a regular basis, with more than 60 per cent using best-practice approaches, such as regularly cleaning the boat hull and niche areas of the boat, renewing anti-fouling coatings each year and capturing biofouling waste after cleaning. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents demonstrated considerable interest in doing the right thing to protect the environment. The analysis presents opportunities to develop messaging that could be used as part of future engagement strategies with recreational boaters to influence behaviour voluntarily and promote best practice biofouling management activities.

    "description": "ACT Canopy Estimate Statistics 2020 for blocks, divisions and road polygons are derived from the ACT Canopy Cover 2020 footprint dataset (available soon). The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area).

Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\n1m diameter cages were constructed and stocked with 4 crabs of the species Uca capricornis. During one semilunar cycle, from one neap tide to the next, digital photographs were taken of 22 crabs (10 males, 12 females) active in the cages at approximately low tide. Photos were examined to observe any colour changes on a day to day basis. \n\nThe results show that Uca capricornis do not rythmically change their colour or pattern between moults. Although some individuals did exhibit a slight variation, by brightening or darkening existing colours, there was no apparent trend in the number of crabs either brightening or darkening with respect to the time in the cycle.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for grain producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Grain producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that grew at least 40 hectares of grain, oilseed or pulse crops. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n The AAGIS is funded by The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC), Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. \r\n\r\n This report was commissioned and funded by the GRDC. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income for grain producing farms is estimated to have increased by 7 per cent in 2014-15 to an average of $229 000 a farm as higher total cash receipts more than offset a small rise in total cash costs. The average rate of return was 2.8 per cent. In 2015-16 average farm cash income is estimated to have increased further to around $258 000 and the average rate of return to have increased to around 3.5 per cent. \r\n• Specialist grain farms (grain farms that obtained more than 50 per cent of their total receipts from crops sales) recorded an average farm cash income of $304 000 in 2014-15; for non-specialist farms it was about $124 000. On average, from 2000-01 to 2015-16, specialist farms recorded farm cash incomes around $125 000 higher than non-specialist farms. \r\n• The Western region recorded higher average farm incomes and rates of return than the Northern and Southern regions in 2014-15. The Western region is estimated to have again been the best performing region in 2015-16. \r\n• The cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth - at 1.8 per cent - of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity include new plant varieties, better water management and improvements in cropping equipment technology. \r\n",

    "description": "The _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights.\r\n\r\n_Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ presents information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes of ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology described in the ABARES report _Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights_ (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/AusIndigLandForestEstate_v1.0.0.pdf). The Indigenous land dataset is then combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the _Forests of Australia (2023)_ dataset. The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThe Indigenous estate land attributes are as follows:\r\n\r\n* __​Indigenous owned__: freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land or forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan\r\n* __Other special rights__: land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements, and legislated special cultural use provisions.​\r\n\r\nThe _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ dataset shows that a total of:\r\n\r\n* 154 million hectares of land in Australia (20%) is Indigenous owned, of which 24 million hectares is forest\r\n* 192 million hectares of land in Australia (25%) is under some form of Indigenous management, comprising 156 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 36 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed. Of this, 31 million hectares is forest, comprising 20.7 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 10.6 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed\r\n* 443 million hectares of land in Australia (58%) is subject to other special rights for Indigenous peoples and communities, of which 62 million hectares if forest.\r\n\r\nThese areas of land are not mutually exclusive: there is substantial overlap between Indigenous owned land, Indigenous managed or co-managed land, and land subject to other special rights. Spatial intersection of these attributes confirms the total area of land in the Indigenous estate in Australia as at 2023 was 536 million hectares (70%), and the total area of forest in the Indigenous estate as 70 million hectares, as reported in Indicator 6.4a Area of forest to which Indigenous people have use and rights that protect their special values and are recognised through formal and informal management regimes (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/criterion-6/indicator-6.4a) of _Australia’s State of the Forests Report_ (available at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr).",

This record contains 3 datasets. The first two contain data relating to wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure for the time periods 02/11/88-29/01/90 and 10/08/90-31/10/90. The third dataset provides cross- and long-shore wind velocities for the first sampling period between 02/11/88-29/01/90.\n\nIn these datasets samples have been averaged to provide an hourly mean. Data is presented in the 'ocean format' i.e.  \"direction going to\".\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for July 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents results of the 2015 Northern Prawn Fishery survey, comprising survey based estimates of financial and economic performance for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial years, as well as non-survey based estimates of economic performance for the fishery in the 2014-15 financial year. Other indicators presented in the report include the total factor productivity index, input costs and ouput prices and management costs. \r\n\r\n The Australian fisheries economic indicators report expands on and takes the place of the former Australian fisheries surveys report. The information and analysis contained in these reports are accessed by policy makers, managers, researchers and industry. Alongside the usual detailed information about the financial performance of the average vessel and the overall economic performance of the fishery, this report also provides analysis of additional economic indicators for the Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery. The construction of these indicators draw upon the data collected through the fisheries survey program. Together with the financial and economic performance information, these indicators help to form a comprehensive picture of the economic performance of the Northern Prawn Fishery over a number of years. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The report has found that profit at full equity, a profit indicator that assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, increased for the average boat in the fishery between 2012-13 and 2013-14, from $239 066 to $382 939. \r\n• Net economic returns (NER) for the fishery rose from $5.2 million in 2012-13 to $12.3 million in 2013-14. The increase in NER from 2012-13 to 2013-14 was primarily driven by faster growth in fishing income than in fishing costs. The growth in fishing income was driven by increased landings of tiger prawns and banana prawns offsetting slightly lower beach prices for each. \r\n• The report indicates that total factor productivity (TFP) improved from 2004-05 to 2013-14. A strong relationship is evident between TFP and landed banana prawn catch, which is in turn largely dependent on seasonal conditions. Improved productivity also reflects the targeting of maximum economic yield (MEY) in the tiger prawn component of the fishery from 2004-05, effort reduction targets by management and the structural adjustment package (completed 2006-07) removing excess capital in the industry. \r\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nGrasslands of the Territory include a rich assemblage of flora and fauna species that combine into a unique ecosystem. These grasslands are a priority for protection and management as they contribute to our natural biodiversity, our history and heritage, and local amenity and community. Natural Temperate Grasslands are an Endangered Ecological Community in the ACT (Nature Conservation Act 2014) and Critically Endangered Ecological Community under the EPBC Act 1999. Other native and exotic grasslands in the ACT can also have some conservation significance as they support important populations of threatened fauna and flora.\n\nNatural Temperate Grassland occurs in areas where few trees grow because of factors such as low temperatures, low rainfall and infertile or clay soils. Only 2% to 10% of the lower elevation grasslands in south-eastern Australia remain in high ecological condition, eight grassland species of the ACT are listed as endangered or vulnerable and some of the constituent plants and animals are under threat. Temperate grasslands are considered one of the most threatened Australian ecosystems. <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>. Extensive areas of native grassland in Namadgi National Park are to be field checked to determine whether they qualify as Natural Temperate Grassland. \n\nMore information on threatened species occurring in grasslands in the ACT can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>\n\nThe 2017 ACT <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/2547440/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans-2017.pdf\">Native Grassland Conservation Strategy</a> and associated action plans guide the protection, management and restoration of native grasslands and its component species for the next 10 years. See a <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans\">summary of the strategy</a>. This strategy supersedes Action Plan 28 ACT Lowland Native Grassland Conservation Strategy (Environment ACT, 2005).\n\nFit for purpose: This mapping is fit for use at a 1:10000 scale. Significant advances are being made towards a high resolution vegetation map for the ACT that is suitable for use at scales ranging from broad regional planning to local planning and property planning. However, Natural Temperate Grassland condition can fluctuate widely depending on seasonal conditions and thus boundaries and presence may fluctuate.\n\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the layers are free from error. © ACT Government\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

The study was commissioned by the Albury City Council to inform the design of the South Albury levee upgrade. \n\nThis report supersedes previous flood studies for the Murray River at Albury and provides a revised flood frequency analysis of design flows, including calibration and sensitivity testing of the hydraulic model. The modelling shows that the proposed levee upgrades lead to improved flood protection in South Albury for events up to and including the 1% AEP (Annual Exceedance Probability) event. The flood mapping produced is intended to replace existing Murray River flood mapping and is considered fit for purpose to inform the levee's design.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Synthesizing three decades of seagrass spatial data from Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait have globally significant seagrass habitat that provide food for threatened dugong and turtle, and habitat for commercially important fish and prawns. Key to understanding, managing, mitigating risk, and monitoring seagrass in this remote region is reliable data on seagrass distribution and species composition and how these changes through time. Data on seagrass has been collected in these areas since the 1980s, but data location and storage from these efforts remains disparate, in many cases not publicly available, and in some cases has already been lost. Our study will compile, validate and synthesize historical seagrass spatial data to create a publicly available database accessible on eAtlas. This product will provide end-users with a valuable spatial resource to assist management and monitoring of seagrass in the region. \n\n(i) Identify key seagrass habitat and migration corridors for dugong and turtles in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\n(ii) Identify regions where seagrass information is deficient (knowledge gaps)\n(iii) create a foundations for models assessing exposure to risk (water quality and other environmental impacts, climate change, etc)\n(iv) provide essential information for management, planning, and developing long-term monitoring plans\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • seagrass data [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe Steedman EMS-16 Meteorological Station housing an R.M. Young anemometer and YSI barometer was set up near Governor Head, Jervis Bay (35.133S, 150.762E). The site was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nBetween 3nd Nov 1989 and 24th September 1991 the station recorded wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure. \n\nThe Meteorological Station recorded 15 minute vector averages of the wind velocity and 15 minute values of air pressure. Data is presented in the oceanographic format i.e. 'direction going to'. The datasets titled 'Additional meteorological data' provide information on the average wind speed and direction, as well as the maximum gusts.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n As part of a three year (2015-16 to 2017-18) joint project between Forest and Wood Products Australia (FWPA) and ABARES, ABARES developed quarterly sales volume forecasts for selected wood products from the FWPA Softwood Data series. This technical report documents the methods and assumption underlying ABARES forecasts. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The FWPA Softwood Data Series (FWPA 2016) was established in 2002 by Australia's major softwood sawmilling companies and provides monthly sales volumes for 44 detailed product categories. ABARES was tasked to estimate quarterly forecasts for four specific wood products; untreated structural pine less than 120mm, untreated structural pine greater than 120mm, termite treated structural pine and landscape wood products. These forecasts will be made available for members of the FWPA data dashboard. \r\n\r\n\r\n• The econometric models estimated in the report are not based on formal structural economic models of the relevant wood product markets. Instead, they are simple, statistically robust, predictive models that are based on historical relationships and patterns observed over the sample period. \r\n\r\n\r\n• In interpreting or using ABARES forecasts it should be noted, that the FWPA Softwood Data series do not include all producers in the industry and the number of participating producers is changing over time. As such, the series are not representative of national production or sales and the effects of new entrants in the data series has the potential to affect the validity of the estimated models. The models estimated in this study, and approaches used to generate forecasts, will be periodically reviewed by ABARES in order to improve the accuracy of forecasts over time. \r\n",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Australian Commonwealth fisheries are managed with the objective of maximising economic returns to the Australian community - an objective that may be served by increasing the efficiency of the fishing fleet. This paper presents a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. ABARES used boat-level data to explore the potential of the SFA approach to determine the efficiency of the fleet and find reasons for any inefficiencies. \r\n\r\n This preliminary work: • indicates significant inefficiency in the CTS fleet \r\n• provides some support for the hypothesis that a structural adjustment in 2006 resulted in less efficient boats leaving the fishery, which led to improved economic returns \r\n• shows that interannual effects, such as stock availability, management changes and technical change, play a large role in the estimated frontier and must be disentangled from each other in further work to provide more information for managers.\r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

The study, which follows on from the flood studies undertaken for the area, has been undertaken in accordance with the NSW Government’s Flood Prone Land Policy. A full assessment of the existing flood risk in the catchment has been carried out, including flood hazard across the various catchments, overfloor flooding of residential, commercial and industrial properties, identification of known flooding issues and hotspots, and emergency response during a flood event. A range of measures aimed at managing this flood risk were also assessed for their efficacy across a range of criteria, which will allow options to be recommended as part of the Floodplain Risk Management Plan for the area. Measures included upgrade of the South Albury levee, retarding basins, pit and pipe upgrades and various property modification measures.",

    "description": "Data layers provided by the LGA and the information within are only valid at the time of production. The habitat layer provided by the LGA may vary in spatial coverage of vegetation based on the date of production and the latest imagery used to determine current vegetation presence. \nPotential clearing of vegetation based on landuse zoning is only indicative as variable outcomes of vegetation clearance based on the landuse zoning can occur.\nKoala Corridor mapping is only indicative as koalas do not traverse the landscape in a linear direction, although they will seek favoured trees.\nKoala occupancy mapping is only indicative as records rely on recording koalas in the landscape, records are driven by human activity.\nNot all areas were assessed, only areas that have the potential to be developed and therefore the potential to impact koala habitat. \nThis research has been funded by the NSW Koala Research Plan under the NSW Koala Strategy. The NSW Koala Research Plan sets out a targeted and coordinated way for us to increase our knowledge of koalas. It is a 10-year plan that will be regularly reviewed and updated throughout its life.\nFind out more about the Koala Research Plan: https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/programs-legislation-and-framework/nsw-koala-strategy/nsw-koala-research-plan\n__Find more datasets: __ https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/group/about/nsw-koala-research-plan",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were already in very good condition at the end of winter. \r\n• Rainfall in September was well above average in most regions in the eastern states (including South Australia). This resulted in plentiful supplies of soil moisture being available to crops during the critical period for grain development. However, in some areas, particularly in New South Wales, the September rainfall resulted in flooding and waterlogged crops, which adversely affected grain development. \r\n• In Western Australia, spring rainfall was average to slightly below average--but timely--and aided grain development. However, severe frosts adversely affected grain development in some growing regions. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes with higher production forecast for every state. This represents a 14 per cent upward revision from the forecast ABARES published in the September 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n• For the major winter crops: wheat production is forecast to rise by 35 per cent to a record high of 32.6 million tonnes; barley production is forecast to rise by 24 per cent to a record high of 10.6 million tonnes; and canola production is forecast to rise by 22 per cent to 3.6 million tonnes, which would be the third-highest on record. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology indicated in its latest three-month rainfall outlook (December 2016 to February 2017), issued on 24 November 2016, that summer was likely to be drier and warmer than average. This should aid harvesting. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n• Australian cotton production is forecast to increase by 64 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.0 million tonnes of cotton lint and around 1.5 million tonnes of cottonseed. This forecast largely reflects increased planted area, which is estimated to have almost doubled to 520 000 hectares. \r\n• Area planted to grain sorghum is forecast to fall by 31 per cent in 2016-17 to 471 000 hectares, the lowest in 24 years. This reflects higher expected returns from growing cotton. Grain sorghum production is forecast to fall by 29 per cent to 1.4 million tonnes. \r\n• Area planted to rice is forecast to increase almost fourfold in 2016-17 to 90 000 hectares in response to an increase in the supply of irrigation water available to rice growers. However, area planted to rice is expected to be constrained by the later than usual winter crop harvest in southern New South Wales. Rice production is forecast to rise to 916 000 tonnes, an increase of more than three times on the previous season. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the first national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at September 2017. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). It complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 dataset (ABARES 2017). Agricultural commodities are assigned to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8 (ABARES 2016) classes based on; perceived intervention to the landscape, growing conditions and management, the intended use of the commodity, consistency with national and international reporting frameworks and standards, such as National Plantation Inventory, industry guidelines, Australian Bureau of Statistics, harmonised trade codes and ABARES commodity reports, where possible. \r\n\r\nCommodities data were produced as part of catchment scale land use mapping and primarily uses fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field (ABARES 2011, 2015). Field validation was critical for mapping commodities. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nJurisdictions captured commodity data (where possible) for those areas most recently mapped in the Catchment scale land use of Australia - Update September 2017 (ABARES 2017) with a focus on horticultural and intensive animal industries. Other commodities which are tertiary classes of the ALUM classification (such as sugar cane, cotton, rice, olives and grapes) have been mapped by jurisdictions for some time and are included in this dataset. Agricultural commodity level mapping is available for all of the Northern Territory, and is likely to be complete for the following commodities nationally: \r\n\r\n* Crops - rice, sugar cane, cotton\r\n* Fruit - bananas (except Southern Queensland), avocados, mangoes, olives, grapes\r\n* Nuts - macadamias\r\n* Livestock - dairy cattle, pigs, poultry, horse studs, aquaculture.\r\n\r\nCommodity information is selected from an agreed list of commodity names developed by ACLUMP partners. A commodity may be applied to one or many land use codes. For example the commodity 'wheat' is applied to class 3.3.1, 'Cropping' or 4.4.1, 'Irrigated cropping', while 'cattle' may be applied to any land use where cattle are observed including 2.1.0 'Grazing native vegetation', 3.2.0 'Grazing modified pastures', 4.2.0 'Grazing irrigated modified pastures', 5.2.2 'Feedlots' etc. \r\n\r\nThe commodity description is intended to add information to the catchment scale land use map which is not otherwise recorded in the ALUM Classification. Where there are several suitable commodity descriptions mappers are encouraged to record the most detailed description. For example when cattle breeds are known to be for milk production mappers would apply the commodity description 'cattle dairy' rather than just 'cattle'.\r\n",

    "description": "Fiddler crabs are not generally considered subjects for the study of monogamy as they tend to live in dense mixed sex colonies with numerous neighbours and individually defended territories. Here, a series of experiments have been conducted demonstrating the unique relationship between neighbouring males and females in the species Uca capricornis. These experiments illustrate that this species of fiddler crab is socially monogamous. Six experiments were conducted in relation to this investigation in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November to January in 2002-2006: \n\n1) Natural male-female interactions and territoriality - Twenty-one pairs were filmed from overhead for a period of 30 minutes. Any activity was noted, as was any interactions with intruders. Territoriality was also examined, providing the overall area covered by the crabs within the half hour. By aligning the male and female territories with their respective burrows it was possible to determine the area overlap between them. \n\n2) Sex ratio and distribution - The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The sex ratio in relation to size was determined. The location of burrows was also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\n3) Burrow tenure -To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. \n\n4) 'Neighbour' and 'stranger' relations - This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed.\n\n5) Response of paired crabs when faced with intruders of differing sex. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. \n\n6) Size-assortative mating -This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. This investigation was based upon data collected during the other experiments.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report examines Australian and international experience in monitoring farmgate and retail prices for food products. It also outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The food retail sector in Australia is highly concentrated while there is increasing consolidation in the food processing sector. There is some concern that this could lead to farmers receiving lower prices and consumers paying higher prices than would be the case in a perfectly competitive market. \r\n• The paper reviews local and international research in monitoring movements in farm and retail prices for food products, outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n• The review of international research found significant variation across countries in the importance they place on food price monitoring and analysis. Research has consistently found that the more processed food products are, the lower the farm share, and that farm shares have generally been declining over time. \r\n• The review also found that the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS) is a world leader in analysing prices in food supply chains. The paper outlines a relatively simple methodology used by the USDA ERS to monitor changes in farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products. \r\n• While there are limitations with the USDA ERS approach, an increase in farm-to-retail price spread or a decrease in farm share of the retail price could be a useful early indicator that competition issues are emerging within a supply chain. However, additional analysis will always be required to confirm whether the cause was an increase in market power because these changes can occur for a number of reasons, including differences in productivity in different sectors or input prices increasing at a faster rate in the retail sector than in the farm sector. Unfortunately, there is generally a lack of data that will allow a breakdown in marketing costs to facilitate this analysis. \r\n• One option for additional research is to replicate another methodology developed by the USDA ERS, which uses input-output data to decompose costs and profits between different sectors within a supply chain and to estimate returns to primary factors, including capital and labour. This type of analysis would be more expensive than the high-level analysis described in this paper but it would also be more informative than the farm share/price spread analysis in identifying the range of factors influencing prices, and lead to a more informed debate about the various factors influencing prices, including market power. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts. A comprehensive description of the methodology and outcomes is available in this report.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "\n\n\nThis digital soil landscape product contains natural resource mapping for the Australian Capital Territory. The project was completed by the Office of Environment and Heritage (NSW). The project was funded by the ACT Government to enhance knowledge of soils, landscapes and physical constraints to land use in the urban and rural environment. The information will assist in informed decision making, planning and environmental modelling throughout the catchment.\n55 soil landscape map units have been described for the ACT. Each unit is an inventory of soil and landscape information with relatively uniform land management requirements, allowing major soil and landscape qualities and constraints to be identified.\nThe GIS product shown here provides location of each of the soil landscape map units - including the soil landscape code and name. For more detailed information please see the full soil landscape reports for each unit, as well as the final report (see datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au). Detailed spreadsheets can be used to join more detailed information to the GIS also available on request.\nLineage:\nThe mapping undertaken by the NSW Government was created using:<ul><li>\nexisting published soil landscape mapping (Canberra and Michelago 1:100,000 map sheets);</li><li>\nnew soil landscape mapping (part Brindabella and Tantangara 1:100,000 map sheets).</li></ul>\nFor all datasets, provisional soil landscapes were established firstly on the dominant geomorphic processes responsible for the formation of the landscape and secondly on the geological parent material. Elevation, aspect, vegetation patterns and human disturbance were other factors considered when defining units. \nFor existing mapping, the boundaries of these provisional soil landscapes were mapped using stereoscopic interpretation of 1:40,000 scale black and white and 1:25,000 scale colour aerial photographs (Canberra) and 1:40,000 scale black and white aerial photographs only for Michelago. LANDSAT thematic mapper and radiometric imagery were used to assist with perception and charting of provisional soil landscapes. These boundaries were transferred onto 1:25 000 topographic base maps. After field checking boundaries and detailed investigations of the soil, the provisional landscapes were confirmed, amalgamated or sub-divided.\nFor new mapping on the Brindabella and Tantangara sheets, the boundaries were captured by digitizing directly to screen at around 1:10,000 scale using ArcGIS. Ultra-high resolution (10 cm) aerial photographic imagery provided a base layer during the capture process. In addition the following data were used to assist delineate soil landscapes boundaries: ADS digital aerial imagery, radiometric imagery, SPOT 5 satellite imagery, climate data, 1 second DSM and DEM elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 1:100,000 scale geological mapping, 1:25,000 topographic maps and DTDB digital terrain models.\nSoils have been examined and described in detail at over 500 sites in the ACT. This includes 79 new detailed sites to fill data gaps for this project. At each site, soil morphological data and site information were recorded on Soil and Land Information System (SALIS) cards or digitally collected via the eDIRT field data collection system. Sufficient field work was undertaken within each soil landscape to identify the range of soils present and to enable their distribution within the landscape to be described. To best knowledge none of the sites were randomly sampled. Sample intervals were selected to be morphologically representative examples of each soil material present in each type profile i.e. soil horizons.\nA comprehensive suite of soil tests have been analysed for many of the representative type soil profiles within the ACT.\nA desktop review of published soil landscape units has occurred resulting in some minor amendments to the existing linework.\nPositional Accuracy:\nObservations and soil profiles were located using handheld GPS or using 1:25,000 topographic maps. Soil boundaries on this 1:100,000 scale map product is generally accurate to within 100 m on the ground but variations will occur especially where soil boundaries are gradual. The scale of use of this dataset is 1:100,000.\nAttribute Accuracy:\nSoil landscape map units are defined by unique combinations of soil type, topography, geology, native vegetation, land use, existing erosion/land degradation and constraints to development. The land and soil attributes in this product were mainly assessed using field observations, remote sensing interpretation (satellite, radiometric and aerial photos) and laboratory analysis of dominant soil type profiles.\nLogical Consistency:\nMap unit concepts and polygons, major soil types and soil landscape descriptions have been field verified by a peer soil scientist for many map units especially in published mapping areas and accessible terrain. All units have some level of field investigation and checking. ArcGIS was used to ensure all polygons in the shape file are topologically correct. All polygons have a unique identifier.\nCompleteness:\nAll polygons in the GIS layer are labeled with a soil landscape MasterCode and MasterName. PDF reports and spreadsheet data have been supplied for each map unit.\nAdditional Metadata:\nSoil Landscape of the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12</a>\nSoil Landscape of the Canberra 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf</a>\nSoil Landscapes of the Australian Capital Territory project report:\nCook, W., Jenkins, B., Young, M., Murphy, C., Milford H.B. and Muller, R.

    "description": "Since the peak of the Millennium drought, the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) has seen large increases in nut and cotton plantings, decreases in water supply due to environmental water recovery and tighter limits on water trade between regions. These changes have raised concerns about how the water market might cope under drought conditions. \r\n\r\n In this study, ABARES applies an economic model of the sMDB to simulate what would happen to the water market under a repeat of the Millennium drought, with current water demand, environmental water recovery, trade limits and carryover rules. These scenarios provide an indication of future water prices and trade patterns across the sMDB under a repeat of historical climate conditions (for the period 2002-03 to 2016-17). \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n• Modelling results suggest that under a repeat of historical conditions allocation water prices in the sMDB would rise no higher than the peaks observed during the previous drought. \r\n• Whilst demand for water has increased for cotton and almonds, this has been more than offset by reductions in demand in other industries particularly, grazing, dairy and rice. \r\n• Improvements in carryover rules will help to limit price rises under a repeat of the drought, with much larger volumes of water being stored between years. \r\n• Trade limits will likely be binding more often in the future, partly due to the changes in water demand. \r\n• While water price peaks are simulated to be no higher under a repeat of extreme drought conditions, they are higher on average, due in part to environmental water recovery. The modelling suggests a change in the distribution of prices, with fewer years of low prices.\r\n",

    "description": "The purpose of the experiment was to quantitatively examine the colour changes associated with moulting in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin between Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nCircular cages were constructed on the mud flat and characteristically marked crabs were introduced. In total 11 females and 10 males were photographed through at least one moult.\n\nOn average, U. capricornis grow 1.6mm with every moult. With every successive moult the carapace pattern contracts and becomes more distinct, especially in males. In addition to the considerable variation in pattern, both sexes also vary in the specific colour of their spots. Colour changes are associated with moulting and, as with pattern, tend to follow a certain progression.",

    "description": "####_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._####\r\n\r\n### Background ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information. \r\n\r\n### 2020 AIS data ###\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2020 AIS information lodged by multiple charities. \r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2020 AIS data. This report - the 8th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on [our website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/tools/reports/australian-charities-report-8th-edition).\r\n\r\n### Interpreting AIS data ###\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au).\r\n\r\n### Withheld information ###\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n### More ACNC data ###\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. \r\n",

    "description": "*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of national land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for application to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature conservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved tenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series. Further information can be found on the Forests Australia website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/",

The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. This pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 5. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors as well as a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n This study examined the features of Australian wild dog management groups, particularly in terms of landholder participation and collaboration, to identify what helps or hinders the groups in achieving coordinated and effective wild dog management. The study was based on interviews with representatives from 30 groups across Australia. \r\n\r\n This work was undertaken as part of a broader ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n\r\n The study found that as well as reduced losses from wild dog attacks, the operations of many groups have resulted in more strategic and targeted control actions and better communication between neighbours. Wild dog management groups function as important social networks that help farming communities cope with the detrimental effects of wild dogs. The report makes suggestions about the support that groups may need in future to achieve wild dog management. \r\n\r\n The study findings have been used in the design of a national landholder survey on wild dog management, which ABARES conducted in late 2014.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Tenure of Australia's forests (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\nTenure of Australia's forests (2013) v2.0 is a continental dataset of tenure classified into national forest tenure classes:  Multiple Use Public Forest, Nature Conservation Reserves, Other Crown Land, Leasehold, Private Freehold and Unresolved Tenure.  The dataset combines forest cover with land tenure information. \r\n\r\n The forest cover information was sourced from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0  dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset, reclassified in order to align the national forest types and national forest categories of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) forest cover dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013). \r\n\r\n The land tenure information was sourced from the commercially available Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) CADLite and Tenure datasets, and tenure data obtained from the former Forests NSW (now Forestry Corporation of NSW). The NFI - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments, whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests - used information from these sources to compile a national tenure dataset by applying a national classification to the data supplied by the states and territories to allow seamless integration. \r\n\r\n As with previous versions, this Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 dataset was produced by combining the NFI land tenure dataset with the most recent Forests of Australia dataset. The only difference between the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) and the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 is that the latter has the updated national forest cover types and new national forest categories. The underlying land tenure data is the same in both versions of the 2013 forest tenure datasets. \r\n",

However, yields of dryland summer crops are expected to be constrained by hot and dry seasonal conditions during summer. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology's latest three-month rainfall outlook suggests above average rainfall is unlikely across the major summer cropping regions in Queensland and northern New South Wales. \r\n• Harvesting of 2016-17 winter crops is now largely complete and production is estimated to have exceeded the forecast of record production presented in the December 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n",

    "description": "_Fires in Australia’s Forests 2016–21 (2024)_ is a continental spatial dataset of the extent and frequency of planned and unplanned fires occurring in forest in the five financial years between July 2016 and June 2021, assembled for _Australia's State of the Forests Report_ Indicator 3.1b Area of forest burnt by planned and unplanned fire. It was developed from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and territory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest Fire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the _Forests of Australia (2023)_ dataset (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/forest-cover), and forest tenure information sourced from the _Tenure of Australia’s Forests (2023)_ dataset.\r\n\r\nPlanned fire: Fire started in accordance with a fire management plan or planned burning program, such as fuel-reduction burning or prescribed burning.\r\n\r\nUnplanned fire: Fire started naturally (such as by lightning), accidentally, or deliberately (such as by arson), but not in accordance with planned fire management prescriptions. Also called bushfire or wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.​\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a financial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event occurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is recorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into two categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and advice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe _Fires in Australia’s forests 2016–21 (2024)_ dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's _National Forest Policy Statement_ and the _Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002_ (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.​​",

    "description": "ACT Canopy Estimate Statistics 2020 for blocks, divisions and road polygons are derived from the ACT Canopy Cover 2020 footprint dataset (available soon). The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area). The total tree canopy cover estimate for Canberra for 2020 is based on the footprint of all urban divisions (suburbs): 22.5%.

The 2015 data was captured in late Autumn, whereas 2020 was captured in early Autumn.",

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the former  Australian fisheries surveys report. The information and analysis contained in these reports are accessed by policy makers, managers, researchers and industry. Alongside the usual detailed information about the financial performance of the average vessel and the overall economic performance of the fishery, this report also provides analysis of additional economic indicators for the Commonwealth Torres Strait Prawn Fishery (TSPF). The construction of these indicators draw upon the data collected through the fisheries survey program. Together with the financial and economic performance information, these indicators help to form a comprehensive picture of the economic performance of the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery over a number of years. \r\n\r\n This report presents results of the 2013 Torres Strait Prawn Fishery survey, comprising survey based estimates of financial and economic performance for the 2010-11 and 2011-12 financial years, as well as non-survey based estimates of economic performance for the fishery in the 2012-13 financial year. Other indicators presented in the report include the productivity index, input costs and output prices and management costs. \r\n\r\n Financial performance  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - was negative for the average vessel in the fishery in 2010-11 and 2011-12, at -$89 491 and -$87 366 respectively. \r\n• The change in profit at full equity was primarily attributed to higher cash receipts, which in turn led to higher vessel cash income and higher profit at full equity. \r\n\r\n Economic performance  \r\n• The net economic returns (including management costs) remained negative at -$2.1 million in 2010-11 and -$2.7 million in 2011-12. \r\n• In 2012-13 preliminary net economic returns were estimated at -$2.3 million using non-survey based methods. \r\n• The negative net economic returns from the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery is mainly attributed to the high costs associated with operating in a remote fishery. \r\n",

We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management. \n\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers and staff collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies), and each year the data are summarised and presented by reach. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\n\nThis interactive map and data dashboard allows users to explore Waterwatch data on the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition of waterways in the upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, from 2015-2024.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The Australian Government has invested $50 million through the Australian Competitiveness White Paper to improve the way pest animals and weeds are managed and to increase the capacity of farmers to deal with these threats. This is through investment in projects that: develop new and improved control tools and technologies; improve land manager awareness and access to control tools and technologies; improve land manager knowledge of best practice pest animal and weed management; and increase land manager and community participation in pest animal and weed management activities. \r\n\r\n To enable the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to evaluate outcomes of this investment, baseline data is required to provide a national overview of the status and management of established pest animals and weeds. Currently, there is insufficient data available to establish the baseline. Therefore a national survey of agricultural land managers was undertaken to collect data on pest animal and weed status, impacts and management actions at the property and local area levels. \r\n\r\n This report presents the results of responses from 6470 agricultural land managers, representing broadacre, dairy, horticulture and other livestock industries across all natural resource management regions in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n Nearly 80 per cent of respondents were actively managing a pest animal, and 85 per cent were actively managing weeds on their property in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Shooting and ground baiting continue to be widely used tools for vertebrate pest management. Herbicide is used by 90 per cent of landholders in the management of weeds and reported as effective by the vast majority. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents reported that pest animal and weed control methods they were using were at least moderately effective. \r\n\r\n Agricultural businesses spend a significant amount on managing pest animals and weeds. An average of $19,620 was spent per agricultural business on undertaking pest animal and weed management activities. This include pest animal and weed management related expenditure on traps, baits, herbicides, pesticides/insecticides, fuel, fencing materials, and labour (including the cost of contractors) on the property in the last 12 months. \r\n• For those managing pest animals they spend an average of $7,023 per year (pest animals including feral, natives, insects and other pests (for example, parasites and mites)). \r\n• Agricultural businesses spend an average of $17,917 per year on weed management activities, this includes all activities undertaken as part of the businesses’ usual production cycle activities, for example spraying weeds before planting a crop. \r\n Pest animal and weed control activities took an average of 77 person days per agricultural business by owners/operators (including family members) and 39 person days by contractors, employees and other people (for example, volunteers) in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Nearly eight per cent of landholders were members of a pest animal or weed management group. The majority of the groups had developed a plan for coordinating management activities or collaborating with other stakeholders. \r\n\r\n A majority of land managers reported: new and improved control methods; access to information on control options and methods; more management activities by other land managers (private and public); and better access to biological controls as important actions that could improve pest animal and weed management.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for October 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

This usually involves removing or thinning shrubs and thinning and pruning trees. Debris created by physical removal may be piled and burnt, chipped on site or removed from the site. Physical removal is usually only undertaken in small areas, but may be undertaken more widely in areas such as pine plantations.",

    "description": "This technical annex provides a description of the quantitative economic model used in the report South America: an emerging competitor for Australia's beef industry. The report focuses on the beef industries of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Australia. There are two objectives. The first is to assess the main drivers behind growth of beef exports from each country between 2000 and 2014. The second is to project the value of beef exports between 2014 and 2030 under scenarios reflecting hypothetical and actual changes to policies and operating environments. \r\n\r\n A bilateral trade decomposition model was designed to quantify the historical drivers of beef exports from Australia and its major competitors in South America, with the aim of drawing implications for projections of future bilateral trade flows. Projections are developed for the period from 2014 to 2030 that are indicative of the prospects for both regions to expand their exports under three policy scenarios. \r\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2022 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2022 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2022 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "Core GC04, was collected from the southeastern side of the New Caledonian Basin (22.99965 S, 166.150716 E). Carbonate percent in the curve has an average value of ~79% and varies between 51.4% and 88.8%. Carbonate pecent does show small variations in scale and repeating patterns, however data tends to stay between 70-80%. It is interesting to note that the carbonate percent minimum of 51.4% occurs at the beginning of isotope stage 4 (~73Ka BP). This anomaly is relatively simultaneous to a decrease in 18O and slight increase in sedimentation rate. Significant non-carbonate sediments include glass shards, sub-rounded quartz, radiolarians, sponge spicules, manganese nodules and 'red opaque' material. Trends of glass shard and quartz percentages can be seen in the results. Radiolaria and sponge spicles tend not to show any definite trend, however both tend to increase subsequent to a broader non-carbonate sedimentation increase.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for November 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "###_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. \r\nWe have published explanatory notes to help you understand this dataset.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS.\r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the ACNC website.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click here to view them.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset.",

DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "This is a regional GHRSST level 3 collated (L3C) dataset on 0.02-degree rectangular grid over the Australasian domain (70E to 190E, 70S to 20N) based on retrievals from the AHI imager on board Himawari-8 satellite. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) produces Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) satellite SST products in the International Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) GDS2 file formats for Himawari-8 in real time and delayed mode. This product is composed of reprocessed multi-swath SSTskin retrievals obtained from compositing IMOS Himawari-8 hourly L3C files over the night (before dawn).  \n\nEvery 10 minutes, the Himawari-8 full disk is processed to retrieve SSTs by using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTTOV12.3) and Bayesian cloud clearing method based on the ESA CCI SST code developed at the University of Reading. The hourly product on native grid is then produced by compositing over multiple swaths for the previous 1 hour by selecting the highest quality data with priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour. The L3C-01hour product on native grid is then remapped over the 0.02-degree IMOS grid to compose IMOS L3C-01hour product (Govekar et al., 2021,  https://www.foo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Govekar_FOO_2021.pdf). The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2.",

    "description": "We must understand the natural cycles of the oceans to understand the evolution of our climate through geological time. Core MD 002361 was obtained in 2000 off the coast of Sumatra (113.477166 E, 22.082 S). By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information regarding past oceanographic and climatic systems. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile of the core (revealing sedimentation rates), the relative abundance of planktonic foraminifera over time, and estimates of historical sea-surface temperatures. The core description highlights the stark contrast between glacial and interglacial periods with 1-1.5m bands of red clay indicating interglacial periods, alternating with the 1-1.5m bands of light grey foraminifera sand deposited during the glacial periods.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

The data is from customer billing data and grouped by local\ngovernment areas (LGA) in Ausgridas network.\n\nAverage electricity consumption by geographic area can vary significantly due\nto a number of factors. These include differences in climate, the use of\nnatural gas, the type of housing (house or apartment), type of business\n(commercial or industrial), and varying household socio-demographics or\nbusiness types.\n\nThese figures also do not necessarily include the electricity used in common\nareas of apartments like halls, garages or pools. About 20% of energy in an\napartment building is typically used in these sorts of areas.\n\nThis data does not include high voltage customers and supply to services such\nas public lighting and bus shelters.\n\nFor help in interpreting the data, please contact\n[sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au](mailto:sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au).\n\n",

    "description": "The purpose of this investigation was to quantitatively describe the colour patterns of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis and their ability to change on a socially significant timescale. Five experiments were conducted as part of this investigation, with fieldwork completed in East Point Reserve, Darwin (NT) from Nov. to Jan. in 04/05 and 05/06. The five experiments were: \n\n1) Quantifying colour patterns on the black carapace of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis- To examine the relationship between colouration, carapace size, and sex. This information was used to construct images illustrating the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs.\n\n2) Colour changes associated with moulting - Cages were constructed and stocked with crabs which had been measured and photographed. In total 21 individuals (11 females, 10 males) were photographed through at least one moult. \n\n3) Colour changes associated with the semilunar cycle - During one semilunar cycle, from one neap tide to the next, digital photographs were taken of 22 crabs (10 males, 12 females) active in the cages at approximately low tide. Photos were examined to observe any colour changes on a day to day basis. \n\n4) Daily colour changes - Twenty-seven crabs (13 males, 14 females) were observed on the day after spring tide over several semilunar cycles. Digital photos of the crabs were taken before, during and after low tide. These photographs were examined for any changes in colour or pattern. \n\n5) Rapid colour changes - The ability of the crab to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2014. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "Horticulture farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated citrus, pome and stone fruit growing farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies, with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin accounts for about three-quarters of Australia's citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit production with a large percentage of these crops grown in the southern Basin. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash income for citrus farms increased to around $90 000 in 2013-14 and then declined to around $72 000 in 2014-15. Pome fruit and stone fruit growers achieved average farm cash incomes of around $108 000 and $75 000 in 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15 the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) was 0.4 per cent for citrus growers and 0.7 per cent for pome and stone fruit growers. \r\n\r\n An increasing proportion of citrus farms used drip/trickle systems and fewer farms used low-throw sprinklers. Other irrigation systems used by citrus growers included micro sprays, overhead sprinklers and flood/furrow irrigation. Low-throw sprinklers and drip/trickle irrigation were also the most commonly used systems on stone fruit farms. Pome fruit was irrigated using a range of systems, with the most popular systems being low-throw sprinklers, micro sprays and drip/trickle irrigation. \r\n\r\n Few citrus growers traded water from 2010-11 to 2012-13, but around 54 per cent were net sellers of water in 2013-14. Most pome and stone fruit growers were non-traders in all years except 2007-08 and 2013-14. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for August 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "The walking legs, carapaces and chelae of ocypodid crabs, particularly the well-studied fiddler crabs, are often brilliantly coloured. However, despite this array of colours there is still some debate over whether ocypodid crabs are actually capable of colour vision and what role it might play.\n\nThe aim of this experiment was to test the colour vision capabilities of fiddler crabs in a biologically significant context. To determine whether Uca mjoebergi use differences in spectral composition to discriminate between colours, and thus possess colour vision, I tested their ability to consistently discriminate yellow from various shades of grey. Experiments were conducted in October 2005 on an intertidal mudflat in the East Point Reserve, Darwin.\n\nWhen the crabs were reproductively active, during neap tide, wandering females were caught and placed under a container 15 cm from two identical plaster casts of a U. mjoebergi male's 21.8 mm claw. Females were given a choice between a yellow claw (Dulux Tiny Tin yellow enamel) and a claw painted white, 75% grey, 50% grey, 25% grey or black (made by mixing appropriate amounts of white and black Dulux Tiny Tin enamel paint). It was recorded which claw the female approached within 2 cm. Each combination was tested until 15 females successfully made a choice. \n\nThe same experiment was conducted with two tethered, size matched (within 1 mm claw length), and handedness-matched males in place of the plaster claws. The males were tethered with 1 cm of cotton super-glued to their carapace and tied to a nail stuck in the ground, allowing some restricted movement. I painted the males' claw either with the same yellow paint as above or with the light yellow paint, made by mixing one part yellow to 14 parts white paint. The experiment was repeated 25 times using different pairs of males and new females each time.",

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. Throughout different experiments a total of 746 neighbour relations have been investigated. The size data collected during these experiments (531 male-female neighbours : 215 male-male neighbours) is the basis of this dataset. \n\nFemale size was found to be positively correlated with the size of her nearest male neighbour. Male size was also positively correlated with the size of his nearest male neighbour, but more weakly than between male-female pairs.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from the transect running across the mouth of Jervis Bay, running from Point Perpendicular in the north, to Bowen Island in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~5 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nFor each day of sampling two resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station. For a number of sampling days a third resource is offered, providing vertically averaged CTD data over 4m depth bins.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\r\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\r\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\r\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\r\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\r\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\r\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment Designated irrigation\r\nareas indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\r\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\r\nThe precise meaning of the term designated irrigation area varies from\r\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\r\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\r\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\r\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\r\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\r\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\r\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\r\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\r\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\r\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\r\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\r\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\r\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\r\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\r\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\r\nsource material is highly variable and completness of coverage is poor in\r\nsome regions.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\r\n__00211a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\nLineage: The data set was constructed in vector format by appending irrigation area boundary data sets supplied by various agencies. The component data sets are listed below. One of the component data sets which was supplied as separate tiles in ArcView shapefile format was assembled into a single shapefile data set in ArcView 3.1. All other processing was carried out in ARC/INFO 7.2.1 under SunOS using double precision coordinates. For all operations in which processing used a fuzzy tolerance, the value specified was 0.00001 degrees (about 1 m). The raster form of the data set was made from the vector form. 1) Ord River Scheme, Stage 1, irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by Agriculture WA in ArcView shapefile format.2) Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland. This data set was supplied by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows designated irrigation areas. The coordinate datum is not known with certainty and was assumed to be the Australian Geodetic Datum 1984.3) Northern Murray-Darling Basin irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows actual irrigation areas, based on interpretation of coarse scale imagery derived from Landsat TM images. The data set comprises 11 polygons. Of these, five have not been retained in the national data set because they largely coincide with the much higher resolution polygons of the Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. A sixth has not been retained because it proves to be almost entirely covered by a national park and a perennial lake. One of the polygons that was retained was edited to give precedence to a higher resolution polygon in the Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland data set which it partly overlies.4) Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. This data set was supplied by the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, in ArcView shapefile format, as 50 separate tiles. It shows actual irrigation areas and a variety of other land uses and land covers related to cotton growing. It is based on interpretation of aerial photography and satellite imagery with extensive field checking. Only the polygons showing irrigation areas were included in the national data set. The tiles were merged in ArcView using the merge function of the GeoProcessing Wizard. Further processing was undertaken in AR\r\n\r\n",

The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. The core obtained offshore from Sumatra (BAR9043, 104.0316E, 5.82S) highlights an upwelling signal at 14,000 yrs BP that disrupts the warm stratified water column, which was a feature between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to present. This upwelling is timed to a regional pattern of an intensified Australasian Monsoon.",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe fifth of these six experiments involved the winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), moored in the central part of Jervis Bay (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed.\n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There is only one subsiduary records that directly relates to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \nfef1f3c0-6d9f-11dd-8128-00188b4c0af8",

    "title": "Cost of production - Australian beef cattle and sheep producers 2012-13 to 2014-15",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents and discusses cost of production estimates for beef cattle and sheep producers for the three years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The on-farm cost of beef production on a per kilogram live weight basis increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15, as producers increased farm expenditure in 2014-15 in response to the much higher prices received for beef cattle. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, producers pared back expenditure on beef inputs to a minimum in response to low beef cattle prices in an attempt to maintain operating margins (receipts per kilogram less costs of production). \r\n• The largest increase in production costs occurred in northern Australia, where many beef producers were also subject to dry seasonal conditions in 2013-14 and 2014-15. This resulted in increased expenditure on fodder and freight. Overall, the total cost of production increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15 by 33 cents per kilogram live weight in northern Australia and by 25 cents in southern Australia. \r\n• Total costs of production averaged over the three years ending 2014-15 were similar in southern and northern Australia, at 174 cents per kilogram live weight in southern Australia and 175 cents in northern Australia. Northern Australia includes Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley, Pilbara and Murchison-Gascoyne regions of Western Australia. All other regions are included in southern Australia. \r\n• Higher beef cattle prices in 2014-15 resulted in operating margins increasing relative to the very low margins recorded in 2013-14. However, expenditure on farm inputs increased, so operating margins were similar to those recorded in 2012-13. \r\n• The average on-farm cost of sheep production on a per kilogram live weight basis remained largely unchanged between 2012-13 and 2014-15. \r\n• The average cost of production for beef cattle and sheep producers for the period 2012-13 to 2014-15 decreased as production size increased, which indicates that significant economies of size exist in beef and sheep meat production. These economies of size would be an incentive to expand beef and sheep meat production to enhance profitability. \r\n• Economies of size for sheep producers appear to result mainly from larger sheep enterprises using farm capital and labour more efficiently. However, for beef producers, cash operating costs for larger herd size producers were lower than those for smaller producers and they used farm capital and labour more efficiently. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Hobart in TAS with SA2 code 601051027, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This is a single sensor, multiple swath SSTskin product for three consecutive night-time periods, derived using observations from the AVHRR instrument on the NOAA-XX satellites. It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70°E to 170°W, 20°N to 70°S.  Only night time passes are included in the product. Each grid cell contains the 3 night average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data/product-informa\ntion/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products.  Matchups with buoy SST observations (adjusted to skin depths) indicate typical 2014 biases of &lt; 0.1 degC and standard deviations of 0.5 degC to 0.6 degC for NOAA-18 and NOAA-19.  Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The e-atlas data we have provided is site means… i.e.. the mean of those 25 values. \r\n- LCC - Live coral cover (percent cover), live hard and soft coral pooled.\r\n- LHC - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n- MAC - Macro Algae Cover % (fleshy algas only, does not include turf algae)\r\n- Fish Line_SUM - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. = total number of lines/1500m2.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.\tWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans, R.D., Jones, G.P., Russ, G.R.

    "title": "Mapping of temperate subtidal seagrass beds in Tayaritja Sea Country (Furneaux Group of Islands), Lutruwita (Tasmania) (NESP MaC 3.6)",
    "description": "Seagrass beds are a dominant marine ecosystem of Tayaritja (the Furneaux Group of Islands) in the north-eastern waters off Tasmania. Historical coarse mapping has indicated extensive beds of Posidonia, Amphibolis, Heterozostera, and Zostera species, potentially comprising some of the largest and deepest seagrass extents found in temperate Australian waters. However, limited data on the distribution and ecological value of these seagrass habitats represents a significant knowledge gap in understanding Australia's wetland natural assets.\n\nThis project mapped the extent, ecological composition, population structure, and blue carbon value of seagrass beds around Tayaritja, in partnership with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre. The study area focused on the coastal waters surrounding Flinders Island in the western Furneaux Group, with mapping extending from the high tide line to the depth limit of reliable optical detection (approximately 30 m), based on analysis of field data and satellite imagery capabilities in the region.\n\nThis record specifically describes the benthic mapping component of the study. See https://doi.org/10.25959/WRXK-KV06 for imagery annotation data from the field validation campaigns.\n\nA combination of close-range remote sensing methods was used to map the extent and ecological values of seagrass beds. The approach developed through this study contributed to the creation of the NESP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Seagrass Mapping using Optical Remote Sensing (https://sustainabledevelopmentreform.github.io/nesp-sop-seagrass-mapping)..\n\nHigh-resolution satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 (10 m) sensors, combined with bathymetric LiDAR data and oceanographic variables, was used to map baseline seagrass extent and composition. A field campaign deployed a Benthic Observation Survey System (BOSS) and unBaited Remote Underwater stereo-Video system (stereo-uBRUV) at approximately 400 locations to validate remote sensing outputs. From these data, maps were produced showing the extent and coverage of seagrass, sand, and macroalgae, and where possible, seagrass species composition, subject to water depth and clarity constraints.\n\nSee the \"Lineage\" section of this record for full methodology.\n\nThree key types of mapping products were developed:\n\n---Occurrence probability maps---\nContinuous probability surfaces (0-100%), modelled from presence/absence data, indicating the likelihood of habitat presence at each pixel for:\n• Seagrass (all morphologies; &gt; 5% cover observed in underwater field imagery)\n• Macroalgae species/assemblages\n• Sand\n\n---Habitat percentage cover maps---\nQuantitative estimates of percent cover for each habitat category:\n• Seagrass (all morphologies)\n• Macroalgae species/assemblages\n• Sand\n\n---Derived products---\n• Baseline binary presence/extent maps derived from optimised probability thresholds:\n    ○ Seagrass:     sgprob &gt; 0.5 &amp; sgprob &gt; macroprob &amp; sandcover &lt; 0.9\n    ○ Macroalgae: macroprob &gt; 0.5 &amp; macroprob &gt; sgprob &amp; sandcover &lt; 0.9\n    ○ Sand:           sandprob &gt; 0.5 &amp; sandcover &lt; 0.2\n• Predicted seagrass species composition of binary extent map.\n• Fractional cover visualisation: combining cover percentages of multiple habitats into a single composite product\n• Composite habitat maps: combining binary habitat extents and delineating mixed habitat classes\n\nThese complementary products serve different purposes: probability maps provide confidence measures, extent maps delineate habitat boundaries, percent cover maps support quantitative analysis of habitat density patterns, and composite habitat maps represent the diversity of mixed habitat classes. Together, they provide a comprehensive understanding of seagrass and associated habitat distribution across the study area.",

    "description": "Ambulance Victoria has two official response time targets: Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 85% of incidents state-wide, and\nRespond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 90% of incidents in urban centres with populations greater than 7,500. Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1\", and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nUrban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population.\nAmbulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population\nexceeds 7,500 persons.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Darwin City in NT with SA2 code 701011002, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 1. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "title": "Industry breakdown of PPSR registrations",
    "description": "The Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) is the single, national online database of security interests in personal property in Australia. Personal property generally includes all forms of property other than land, buildings and fixtures. Buyers can check the PPSR to see if the valuable second-hand goods they want to buy are debt-free and safe from repossession. Businesses selling on terms, such as retention of title or consignment, or leasing, renting or hiring out valuable goods can register their security interest on the PPSR. \r\n\r\nThis dataset was specially created by AFSA for GovHack 2016. It contains the number of new registrations on the PPSR by ANZSIC industry division and subdivision.\r\n\r\nAFSA sourced the Industry information from the Australian Business Register (ABR). To do this, AFSA used the Australian Company Number (ACN) to match records. To protect privacy, AFSA assigned each ACN a random number instead of showing the actual ACN.\r\n\r\nThis data is a subset of overall PPSR registrations created. It solely includes registrations created by organisational secured parties that have registered on the PPSR with an ACN. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to that guide for more information. For further inquiries, please email statistics@afsa.gov.au.\r\n",
