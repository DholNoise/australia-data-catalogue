    "description": "A round 1.4m yellow buoy has been deployed in the Heron Island lagoon as part of the sensor network infrastructure at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, a spread-spectrum radio for communicating with the on-reef wireless network, a GPS and initially a surface mounted (30cm under the water surface) thermistor.\n\nThe float is moored in the lagoon of Heron Island in around 3m of water and will be used to monitor the flow of water through the lagoon. It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "title": "Significance of Halimeda bioherms to the global carbonate budget based on a geological sediment budget for the Northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia",
    "description": "Since the correlation between carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures was established in the ice core records, quantifying the components of the global carbon cycle has become a priority with a view to constraining models of the climate system. The link between the marine carbonate budget and atmospheric CO2 levels draws attention to the fact that this budget is still not adequately quantified. \n\nIt is widely accepted that the calcareous green alga Halimeda is a prominent contributor of carbonate to reef sediment facies in the tropics, however, Halimeda bioherms remain one of the main reservoirs of unaccounted for carbonate. In fact, it has been suggested that Halimeda bioherms on the shelf of the Northern Great Barrier Reef may contain an equal or greater volume of carbonate than the reefs themselves.\n\nHere we attempt to determine the quantitative relationship between Halimeda bioherm and coral reef derived carbonate accumulated during the Holocene on the outer shelf of the Northern Great Barrier Reef Province using data from seismic profiles, reef drill cores and Halimeda bioherm piston and vibrocore cores from the published literature. \n\nThe methodology used is detailed in the document availble for download through this record.\n\nCalculations reveal that the ribbon reefs of the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions cover areas of approximately 18.5 and 20.5 km2 and comprise approximately 0.52 and 0.92 Gt CaCO3 respectively. The Halimeda bioherms of the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions cover areas of approximately 184 and 118 km2 and comprise approximately 2.06 and 0.86 Gt CaCO3 respectively. \n\nThus, that ratio of ribbon reef to Halimeda bioherm CaCO3 is approximately 1:4 and 1:1 for the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions respectively. If we assume that the carbonate content of the Lizard Island region bioherms ranges from 20 to 90 %, we estimate that the mass balance of Halimeda bioherm CaCO3 is between 0.55 and 2.5 Gt. The ratio of ribbon reef to Halimeda bioherms CaCO3 may vary between 1:1 to 1:5 depending on the carbonate content of the Lizard Island bioherms.",

    "description": "The 2022 APS Employee Census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees, running from 9 May to 10 June 2022. \r\n\r\nThe Employee Census provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The Census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, employee wellbeing, and job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOverall, 120,662 APS employees responded to the Employee Census in 2022, a response rate of 83%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200MB in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n__TECHNICAL NOTES__ \r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2022 APS Employee Census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2022 APS Employee Census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2022 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2022 APS Employee Census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2022 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2022 APS Employee Census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2022 APS Employee Census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2022 APS Employee Census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.\r\n",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nGroundwater samples were obtained from the Cooper Basin, Eromanga Basin and Lake Eyre Basin as part of Stage 3 of the Cooper GBA project. The Eromanga Basin is a part of the Great Artesian Basin. Evans et al. (2020) and Holland et al. (2020) provide detail on hydrogeology of the Cooper GBA region.  In total 39 samples were collected from a range of hydrogeological settings in two field campaigns. One field campaign focussed on obtaining groundwater samples from bores drawing groundwater from Eromanga Basin and overlying Lake Eyre Basin (LBWCo (2020), Dataset 1). Reservoir water samples were collected by petroleum companies on behalf of the GBA program (Dataset 2). Where possible the samples were clustered to provide hydrochemical information at various depths. The locations of bores that were sampled are outlined in Figure 3.  The sample dataset (Dataset 3, and Dataset 4) is comprised of: – Sixteen from shallow sub-artesian aquifers either the Winton Formation or the Cenozoic Lake Eyre Basin (bores less than 100 m deep). – Thirteen deep GAB bores (sample depths from 1100 to 2070 m).  – Ten samples from petroleum wells producing from deep hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Cooper and Eromanga basins.  Hydrochemical analyses include: field parameters, major and minor ions, hydrocarbons, as well as environmental groundwater tracers. Environmental groundwater tracers include; Strontium isotopes, noble gases including 4He, stable isotopes of water, stable isotopes of hydrogen and carbon from methane, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), as well as radioactive tracers - tritium (3H),  Carbon 14 (14C) and Chloride 36 (36Cl).  Further infromation can be found in the fact sheet 10 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba. \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSampling of aquifers in Eromanga Basin (GAB) and Lake Eyre Basin (Cenozoic) was undertaken by a contractor (LBWCO Pty Ltd) in October 2020. CSIRO sampled 6 GAB bores in November 2019. Samples from production wells were collected by companies on behalf of GBA.",

    "description": "\n<strong>Overview</strong>\nPCTs are spatial polygons that define the type and extent of known vegetation communities within the ACT <code>pctCode</code> . PCTs have been further stratified into 'zones'&nbsp;<code>pctZone</code>, which reflect the ecological condition of PCTs relative to benchmark thresholds. The ecological condition of a vegetation community, or a&nbsp;'zone' <code>pctZone</code>, is assessed using the attributes that define Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and the ACT Nature Conservation Act 2014 (NC Act). Condition zones can be used to identify sites of high quality for conservation protection (e.g. nature reserve) and candidate sites for offsetting. PCTs can also be used to interrogate the spatial distribution and condition of all mapped vegetation areas across the ACT, and are employed as stocktake, planning and on-ground management units to inform the delivery of conservation, restoration and land development programs.\n<strong>ACT plant community types</strong>\nNaturally occurring native plant community types in the ACT are drawn from Sharp (2007), as implemented in the ACT Vegetation Database (2015), and Armstrong (2013). Each community type is identified by a number, e.g., ACT01, ACT25, known as native vegetation codes (<code>pctCode</code>). Non-naturally occurring plant communities such as exotic plantations and native plantings have been assigned numbers not present in Sharp (2007), e.g., ACT65, ACT66, ACT 99. Vegetation communities from Armstrong have been assigned an ACT prefix, while retaining the Armstrong numbering, e.g., ACT152 = u152, ACT118 = u118. Refer to Appendix A for the current list of plant communities in the ACT.\n<strong>Determining pre-1750 plant community type</strong>\nPCTs reflect the most likely plant community found prior to European colonisation, except for where they are plantings or plantations. Disturbances caused by agricultural practices and abandonment of land practices can obscure the pre-colonised state. The determination of the most likely pre-European plant community found at a present-day site is informed by signs such as the presence and type of native species; the growth form and density of remnant canopy trees; the presence of stags or stumps; the presence and species of midstorey shrubs and trees; the floristic composition of the groundstorey; landscape position and other geographical features such as elevation, aspect, soils, apparent hydrology etc.\n<strong>Mapping PCTs and ecological condition zones</strong>\nThe boundaries of each PCT at a site are accurately mapped on-ground by walking the boundaries and recording them using hand-held GPS and marking directly on to high resolution orthorectified aerial photograph field maps. Once PCTs are mapped, a further assessment of condition is undertaken by dividing a PCT into homogenous&nbsp;'zones'&nbsp;<code>pctZone</code> based on the structure (presence or absence of mature canopy and regeneration), floristic composition (ground story dominance and forb diversity) and overall quality&nbsp;('intactness') of the vegetation. A simple matrix based on the criteria for conservation protection under the EPBC or NC Acts is used to categorise the condition of PCTs of grasslands (Table 1) and woodlands (Table 2 and 3). Although initially used to identify TECs for protection and/or offsetting, PCT zoning has been extended to other plant communities in the ACT and is considered a general measure of condition. There are currently 32 recognised ACT PCTs. To date, not all have been spatially mapped, with efforts focused on TECs facing higher threats at lower elevations, which are more likely to meet EPBC and NC Act status.\nGrasslands and woodland/forest PCTs are assessed using different zone criteria. Note: The <strong>zone classifications are based on threatened grassland and lowland woodland community structural and floristic condition and may therefore not reflect non-threatened communities as accurately.&nbsp;</strong>Two components are used to assess the condition of grasslands: ground layer nativeness and forbs; whereas woodlands have four components, due to the additional components of mature trees and regeneration of tree species. The highest condition scores end in the numeral one (e.g. PCT 1.1 or PCT 16.1.1). Table 4 contains a worked example to interpret condition zones for Box-Gum Grassy Woodlands. Note that the highest condition zone does not represent a pristine environment, but one that meets baseline listing criteria.\nPlease also see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e6f060330ca14473a1d6f9454a500bea\">ACT PCT Code</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6250864b1d7242ca90ecfccc9065e170\">Zone Lookup</a>&nbsp;Tables\n<strong>Woodland zone matrix</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Woodland</strong>\nMature Trees +\nMature Tree –\nRegen +\nRegen –\nRegen +\nRegen –\nNative Cover+\nForb Div. +\n16.1.1*\n16.1.3*\n16.2.1*\n16.2.3*\nForb Div. –\n16.1.2*\n16.1.4*\n16.2.2*\n16.2.4\nNative Cover–\nForb Div. +\n16.3.1'\n16.3.3'\n16.4.1\n16.4.3\nForb Div. –\n16.3.2'\n16.3.4'\n16.4.2\n16.4.4\n<strong>Grassland zone matrix</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Grassland</strong>\nGroundstory Dominance\nNative Forb Diversity\nPCT Zone\nEPBC of NC Act definition\nNative Cover+\nForb Div. ++ (High - Very High)\n1.1\nEPBC, NC\nForb Div. + (Mod - High)\n1.2\nEPBC\nNative Cover &gt;50% Themeda, Poa OR Carex\n1.2\nEPBC\nForb Div. – (Low)\n1.3\n&nbsp;\nNative Cover–\nForb Div. + (Mod)\n1.4\n&nbsp;\nForb Div. – (Low)\n1.4&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nTable 1 Vegetation zone designations for grassland communities&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Groundstorey dominance</strong>\n<strong>Native Forb Diversity</strong>\n<strong>PCT Condition Zone</strong>\n<strong>Type of exotic dominance</strong>\n<strong>EPBC or NC Act</strong>\n<strong>(if relating to PCT01)</strong>\n<strong>Native</strong>\n&nbsp;\nCover of all native understorey plants is greater than the cover of perennial exotics plants\nAt least 12 non-grass native species <strong>OR </strong>At least 3 indicator species <strong>OR</strong> Floristic Value Score more than equal to 6.5\nPCT .1\n_\nEPBC, NC\nFloristic Value Score more than equal to 5 but &lt;

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied:\n\n\n\nInstream value assessment developed to support water management activities in NSW is being updated with contemporary datasets. These datasets are integrated into the High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystem (HEVAE) framework, originally developed by the Department of Environment, Commonwealth of Australia. (see: http://www.environment.gov.au/water/publications/aquaticecosystems-\n\ntoolkit-module-3-guidelines-identifying-hevae). The framework incorporates river and/or flow related attributes associated with four of the five recommended HEVAE criteria: Diversity,\n\nDistinctiveness, Naturalness and Vital Habitat. No data is available yet for the fifth criteria, Representativeness. HEVAE assessment is progressively being undertaken for NSW catchments where water planning activities are being undertaken. Attributes associated with each criteria are identified within each catchment of interest, in this case the Hunter Central Rivers. Available data must have spatial\n\ninformation such as coordinates, or polygons that can be intersected by the key stream layer based on River Styles&#xAE; river reaches. This enables river and/or flow related attributes that, could be impacted by extraction, to be associated with river reach spatial layer and enable HEVAE criteria to be displayed in ArcGIS. Depending on the criteria, attributes are weighted according to sensitivity to flow. Some attributes associated with the Distinctiveness criteria are also weighted according to threat status and the certainty or confidence surrounding the occurrence of each record. Scores are determined for each attribute in each criteria and are normalised to provide outcomes that range between 0 -1, where 1 represents the highest possible HEVAE outcomes for each river reach segment. Scores for each HEVAE criteria are combined to provide for a final or overall HEVAE score and assist to identify where priority river reaches occur. This provides a focus for where water sharing rules should be developed to minimise the impact of water extraction on instream values. NOTE: The data used in the Hunter-Central Rivers HEVAE Assessment represents a preliminary HEVAE assessment. Updates will occur to criteria such as Diversity (Fish diversity), Distinctiveness (threatened bird species), and Vital Habitat (Large woody debris and Dissolved Organic Carbon) as the data becomes available.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nProvide a useful framework that indicates the spatial location and importance (priority) of in-stream values to identify risk to in-stream values from extraction. Outputs will guide the development of water\n\naccess and trading rules being developed for NSW water sharing plans.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied:\n\n\n\nTo compile the overall HEVAE outcomes for each river reach in the Hunter-Central Rivers catchment, the following data was compiled for each criteria. Flow sensitivity weightings were applied to all attributes, ranging from 1 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest sensitivity or reliance on river flow. Scores for each attribute and each criteria are normalised to enable scores to be allocated between 1 and 0, where 1 is the highest (best) outcome. Categories are determined and plotted on maps and can be either 3 or 5 categories. Three categories enable outcomes similar to the low, medium and high outcomes derived for macro water sharing plans, while five categories provide a greater level of range in outcomes within a catchment. Where data is available, HEVAE scores are reported at the river reach level. Diversity: Macroinvertebrate Family data is used for Macroinvertebrate.\n\n\n\nLineage Statement\n\nDiversity and were obtained from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (J. Miller pers. comm.), who undertake regular AUSRIVAS monitoring in NSW. Data was collected at specific sites between 2004 and 2012. Macroinvertebrate scores were derived and placed into 4 diversity categories based on the number of Families recorded at each site. Fish Diversity data, also site- based, was obtained from the NSW DPI Fisheries. Data was derived from a State-wide sampling program dataset, with sampling occurring between January 2002 and 2011. Biodiversity scores were derived from the dataset, and placed into 4 fish diversity scores between 0 to 1 (highest). Site-based scores are associated with the river reach where sampling occurred and\n\nupstream and downstream River Styles&#xAE; category. Distinctiveness: Threatened species websites for NSW Office of Environment and\n\nHeritage, NSW DPI Fisheries and the Commonwealth Department of Environment were evaluated using the available specific search tools\n\nthat could provide outcomes at catchment or NRM regional level. If there was uncertainty about the occurrence of a threatened species,\n\npopulations or endangered ecological communities, additional information (eg Profile of Final Determinations) on each relevant website was also inspected. Site based data was obtained from the NSW Atlas of NSW Wildlife. In addition to applying weightings of flow sensitivity, weightings related to threat status, and accuracy of record were also applied. Rare River Styles&#xAE; were determined using the expert assessment by a river geomorphologist of the presence (by total reach length or proportion of lengths) of each River Style&#xAE; category in proximity to strategic recovery reaches, the potential of overall River Style&#xAE; to recover, level of isolation and representation of a particular attribute. The River Styles&#xAE; spatial data is held by the NSW Office of Water. Naturalness: Initially, five attributes were used to report on naturalness, however the macroinvertebrate condition outcomes were removed due to the spurious outcomes this dataset influenced in the naturalness outputs. Flow sensitivity weightings of 1 are applied to each of the four remaining attributes. Attributes used in these criteria include: Geomorphic condition - was reported based on the mapped recovery potential outcomes of river reaches, that are closest to unimpaired or easily recoverable to natural conditions. Data was derived from the Office of Water The River Styles&#xAE; spatial data. Hydrologic Stress - data is derived originally from the macro water sharing plan hydrologic stress assessment, and later from the River Condition Index Risk analysis. Hydrologic stress in the Hunter-Central Rivers region was calculated using two process, i) distributed hydrologic stress for most of the catchment and ii) macro water sharing plan hydrologic stress for the remainder, mostly smaller coastal catchment areas. Full details on each method can be found in the River Condition Index technical manual at:\n\nhttp://www.water.nsw.gov.au/watermanagement/monitoring/catchments Catchment Disturbance Index (CDI) - Final catchment index scores developed for the NSW River Condition Index were used. Data custodian is the NSW Office of Water. CDI outcomes were derived from three sources: i) infrastructure (eg. Roads, railways, utilities...etc) density (from the Office of Water centralised Enterprise database), ii) land use index derived from the Australian Land Use mapping project based crop types, mining and urban uses, forest and plantations, grazing and managed resource areas, and iii) Land Cover Change Index based on loss of woody vegetation derived from the Land and Tree Study (SLATS) method applied by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. River reaches within National Park Estate - The National Parks Estate spatial layer was obtained from the NSW Office of Water Enterprise database. Where the National Park estate polygon intersected a stream (with a 50m buffer either side), a score of 1 was applied to the river reach. Remaining river reach scores were a 0. Vital Habitat: Only one attribute had useful spatial data for this criterion and related the occurrence of Directory of Important Wetlands Australia and RAMSAR wetlands. A 50m buffer along the River Styles stream line was used to intersect and vital habitat wetlands above the tidal limit. NOTE: Vital habitat was not included in the final HEAVE assessment due to some anomalies the attribute produced, however Vital Habitat maps were produced to assist with the assessment. The final or overall HEVAE score was determined for each River Style reach. This was calculated by adding together the final weighted and normalised scores for each criteria (Naturalness, Diversity and Distinctiveness - no Vital Habitat wetlands detected so not included in final computations). This score was then normalised by divided by the maximum combined HEVAE score for the whole Hunter Central Rivers river reaches to provide an even spread of score outcomes between 0 (lowest) and 1 (highest).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2014) Hunter Rivers High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystem NSW Office of Water 20141124.

    "description": "The second capture of the area North of the Floreat Surf Life Saving Club, these sand dunes were captured by UAV imagery on 24th Aug 2022 for the Cambridge Coastcare beach dune modelling and monitoring project. It was created as part of an initiative to innovatively monitor coastal dune erosion and visualize these changes over time for future management and mitigation. This data includes Orthomosaic, DSM, DTM, Elevation Contours, 3D Mesh, 3D Point Cloud and LiDAR constructed from over 500 images captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh\nThe dataset is a Sparse 3D Point Cloud (i.e. a 3D set of points): the X,Y,Z position and colour information is stored for each point of the point cloud. This dataset is of the area North of Floreat SLSC (2022 Flight-2 project area).",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "For the authoritative metadata record for the CAP-AU standard, see: http://www.bom.gov.au/metadata/19115/ANZCW0503900539.\r\nFor further information about the CAP-AU standard,  please contact the CAP-AU Custodian at cap-au@bom.gov.au or visit http://purl.org/cap-au/web/About.shtml.\r\nFor the CAP-AU Specification itself, see http://purl.org/cap-au/web/Spec.shtml\r\n\r\nCAP-AU is the Australian Profile of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  CAP is an open data standard that is developed and maintained by OASIS, a USA-based open standards organisation. CAP is an international xml encoding standard that facilitates the construction and exchange of all-hazard emergency alert and warning messages between various alerting technologies, systems and networks. CAP enables a single warning message to be prepared for dissemination simultaneously over a wide variety of warning systems that understand and can process CAP-formatted messages. \r\n\r\nThe standardised alerts produced using CAP can be exploited by a wide range of software applications and technology devices, each capable of processing the message and responding accordingly. Examples of the kinds of sensor and alerting technologies that can interoperate using CAP messages are data networks, landline and mobile phones, internet, fax, pagers, sirens, billboards and electronic road signs. \r\n\r\nEarly versions of CAP have been in use since 2009 in the various Australian jurisdictions and Commonwealth agencies that are responsible for distributing emergency warning messages to the Australian community. These existing implementations were used as the baseline to develop the common national approach used in this CAP-AU standard. \r\n\r\nFor further information about the CAP-AU standard please contact the CAP-AU Custodian at cap-au@bom.gov.au or visit http://purl.org/cap-au/web/About.shtml\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Statement / Copyright Notice - Use of the CAP-AU-STD documents shall be in accordance with the Intellectual Property Statements and Copyright Notices detailed within each CAP-AU-STD document downloaded from this collection",

    "description": "The __Water for Fodder__ program is part of the Australian Government's Drought Response, Resilience and Preparedness Plan.\r\n\r\nUnder the program, 40 gigalitres of water was produced from the Adelaide Desalination Plant and an equivalent amount released upstream from the River Murray.\r\n\r\nFarmers in the southern connected Murray–Darling Basin were able to apply to purchase South Australian River Murray water (Trading Zone 12) at a discounted rate. The water had to be used to grow fodder and pasture. This helped farmers to maintain their breeding stock during the drought.\r\n\r\n__Round 1__ of the program opened on 11 December 2019 and due to over-subscription, closed on 13 December 2019. Under round 1, 800 parcels of 50 megalitres of water were available at $5,000 ($100 per megalitre).\r\n\r\nFollowing the review of Round 1 and consultation with South Australia, the Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia, the Hon. Keith Pitt MP, has announced that there will not be a second round of the Water for Fodder program. \r\n\r\nRemaining funding will be redirected to other programs that benefit farmers and communities in the Murray–Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nWhile Round 1 was successful, more water is available in the southern Basin due to autumn rainfall. This has reduced the need for a second round as an emergency drought response. \r\n\r\nRead more about the Water for Fodder Program here: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs/basin-wide/water-for-fodder",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2020)* is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia’s Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nAustralia’s National Forest Inventory has previously used the four derived category combinations of Dillon et al. (2015) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/IndigenousForestEstate_20150828_v1.0.0.pdf) for reporting the Indigenous estate in *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2013* and *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2018*. These four categories combined in various ways the individual attributes of the Indigenous estate, with an area of land or forest being allocated to only one of the four categories. However, the categories did not allow separate reporting on Indigenous ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.​\r\n\r\nThe methodology described in Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/publications/indigenous-estate-report) disentangles the four categories of Dillon et al. (2015), and allows separate reporting of each of Indigenous ownership of land or forest, Indigenous management or co‑management of land or forest, and land or forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have other special rights. Separate spatial coverages were created for each of these attributes, and this new dataset can form the basis for subsequent reporting on the relationships between Indigenous peoples and land or forest.\r\n\r\nThe methods and data in this data package use the same sources of data used for assembling the *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* spatial dataset, but presents the information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes ownership, management of co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology of Jacobsen et al. (2020). The Indigenous land dataset is also combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset.​ The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the *Australia's State of the Forests Report* Series. Further information can be found on the Forests Australia website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/sofr-2018",

    "description": "Enhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP)-Air Sea Flux sub-facility collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific  and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. Data products are quality controlled observations, and bulk air-sea fluxes.\n\nResearch Vessel Real Time Air-Sea Fluxes, aims to equip the Marine National Facility (MNF) (Research Vessel Southern Surveyor) and the Research and Supply Vessel, Aurora Australis with \"climate quality\" meteorological measurement systems, capable of providing high quality air-sea flux measurements and delivered to researchers on a near real-time basis. Obtaining the full set of air-sea fluxes essential for climate studies requires observations of: wind, air and sea temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, long- and short-wave radiation. The existing ship meteorological sensor sets have been completed with IMOS instruments and a comprehensive annual calibration programs implemented. The ships have dual sets of radiometers, temperature and humidity sensors, precipitation gauges (optical rain gauge and Siphon gauge) and anemometers (2-d sonic and prop/vane - Southern Surveyor only)  . The Aurora Australis will be fitted with two long-wave radiometers and one ORG (serviced during winter port time). Data streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 1-minute averages of the observations and a daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.",

    "description": "This dataset contains cycling volume, movement flow and demographic data for the 'Super Sunday' Recreation Bike Count event over the years 2011 to 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were visually undertaken by volunteers. The data covers the following Local Government Areas (LGAs):\n\n\nBoroondara\n\n\nMonash\n\n\nMoonee Valley\n\n\nMoreland\n\n\nWhitehorse\n\n\nYarra\n\n\nBicycle Network's 'Super Counts' programs count the volumes of bicycles and other active travellers, and their movements on roads and paths. The Super Counts program comprises two counting events: 'Super Tuesday' commuter count and the 'Super Sunday' recreation count. Super Tuesday is a two-hour count conducted during a Tuesday morning peak period in March (7-9am); Super Sunday is a four-hour count conducted during a Sunday morning-afternoon period in November (9-1pm).\nFor more information please visit Bicycle Network Bike Counts.\nBicycle counts help track progress, and identify areas of improvement to inform active transport policy with the goal of making it easier for more people to choose active modes everyday. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nAURIN has converted dates to ISO 8601 format, and have spatially enabled this dataset by creating geometries from the latitude and longitude columns with PostGIS.",

    "title": "Mammals Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective delivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are influenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1\", and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\" response. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time performance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics Urban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population. Ambulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population exceeds 7,500 persons.",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThese tables present a summary of employment under the _Public Service Act\r\n1999_ at 31 December 2011 and during the 2011 calendar year. The data is an\r\nupdate of that presented in the _APS Statistical Bulletin 2010-11. _Data will\r\nnow be available at six monthly intervals -A through this summary for\r\ncalendar year data, and through the annual State of the Service Report (SOSR)\r\nand APS Statistical Bulletin (the Bulletin) for more detailed financial year\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nThe data in these tables is sourced from the APS Employment Database (APSED),\r\nwhich contains data extracted from agencies-C/ HR systems. The Australian\r\nPublic Service Commission continues to work with agencies to improve the\r\nquality and timeliness of the data they provide to APSED. Each year extensive\r\naudits and error checking of APSED are undertaken, to ensure that sound\r\nconclusions can be drawn from the data. Through this audit process, previously\r\npublished data has been updated. The June 2011 data published in SOSR and the\r\nBulletin has been revised.\r\n\r\nAs in the Bulletin, a headcount approach is used in these tables-that is,\r\npeople working part-time are aggregated with people working full-time without\r\nweighting. Data also includes inoperative staff. Employees-C/\r\nclassification in these tables refers to their base or substantive\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations used in these tables and changes to administrative arrangements\r\nfor the period July to December 2011 are explained below. The Explanatory\r\nNotes at Appendix 1 of the Bulletin provide definitions of terms used in these\r\ntables. The Bulletin is available at [http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-\r\napsc/parliamentary/aps-statistical-bulletin/snapshots-\r\ndecember-2011](http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-apsc/parliamentary/aps-\r\nstatistical-bulletin/snapshots-december-2011)\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for March 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "title": "IMOS - ANMN Passive Acoustic Observatory at Perth Canyon, WA (PAPCA)",
    "description": "The Perth Canyon Passive Acoustic Observatory consists of two to four moorings fitted with hydrophones set on the seabed at 400-490 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of: \n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and \n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian). \n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",

The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were visually undertaken by volunteers. The data covers 47 Local Government Areas (LGAs) across ACT, NSW, SA, TAS, VIC and WA.\n'Super Tuesday' is Australia's largest visual bike count, where volunteer counters observe and record cyclist numbers across Australia. The Bicycle Network data is collected within 97 councils and over 1,500 sites, the 'Super Counts' are Australia's largest cycling surveys of their kind.\nBicycle Network have used a consistent methodology across Australia to collect consistent figures on cycling participation. The data can be used to compliment other traffic surveys, such as automated systems by providing a broader picture of cycling trends at both a local and national scale.\nFor more information please visit Bicycle Network Bike Counts.\nBicycle counts help track progress, and identify areas of improvement to inform active transport policy with the goal of making it easier for more people to choose active modes everyday. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nAURIN has spatially enabled this dataset by creating geometries from the latitude and longitude columns with PostGIS.",

    "title": "Parent record: Water exchange processes between Jervis Bay and shelf waters",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe third of these six experiments was designed to monitor the exchange of water between the bay and the shelf. The data collection spanned one year from April 1989 to April 1990, in order to get an indication of seasonal variability in the flow. Throughout the 12 month period, 3 current meter moorings, a separate tide gauge mooring and a meteorological station were maintained. \n\nTypical mooring deployments were 2 months with inter-deployment gaps of 1 or 2 days. Moorings were re-deployed in nominally the same location, although these varied slightly. Two moorings were maintained in the bay entrance, one off Point Perpendicular and one off Bowen Island, each containing two current meters. A third mooring was in 100m water depth, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular and this mooring housed 3 current meters and a tide gauge. A separate tide gauge was maintained in a mooring in 10m of water, 200m off Bowen Island, inside the bay. [Given that meteorological data collected from the station on Governor Head bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There are four subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n089f8080-c897-11dc-85f3-00188b4c0af8\na2c0a820-c576-11dc-b888-00188b4c0af8\nd03f0f00-c47a-11dc-9a66-00188b4c0af8\ne4eaf410-d469-11dc-9644-00188b4c0af8",

The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nAWRA-L model calibration outputs reulting from modelling based on observation data from 16 streamflow gauges. The model outputs include high streamflow calibration results and low streamflow calibration results. \n\nThe AWRA-L model version 4.5 has been used for all BA surface water simulations. The application is developed with the C\\# language. The executable file \"BACalibrationAndSimulationApp.exe\" generates global definition files which define the input and output data and input time series locations. The executable file \"SimulateModel.exe\" runs simulations based on the global definition files and outputs required variables (Qtot, Qb, Dd) in NetCDF format. All simulation runs have implemented on local Windows 7 work stations.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis data used as a reference to evaluate uncertainty analysis results.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis is the model calibration results obtained from AWRA-L model.The model outputs include high streamflow calibration results and low streamflow calibration results.The model calibration was carried out against historical streamflow data obtained from 16 catchments, which was obtained in in 2 February 2014.  \n\n\n\nThe model calibration outputs were generated in 20 November 2014.\n\n\n\nThe executable file \"BACalibrationAndSimulationApp.exe\" generates global definition files which define the input and output data and input time series locations.

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

The upper\nreaches of the catchment are in the suburbs of Rockdale and Bexley and are principally\nresidential. It flows through a pipe network towards the Illawarra Railway Line. The railway\nline is raised above the natural ground level for a considerable distance either side of the main\npipe network under the line which may restrict surface flows from the western side.\nImmediately east of the railway line the catchment comprises a Commercial area along\nPrinces Highway and incorporates most-of the Rockdale City Centre.\nThe pipe conduit network combines into an open concrete trapezoidal section at Short Street,\nBanksia. The section downstream is through a low level residential area built fairly close to\nthe channel. As the channel continues past West Botany Street it flows through an open park\narea with some adjacent wetland areas. It eventually drains into the Cooks river at the\nconfluence of the Cooks River with Muddy Creek.\nMuddy Creek\nThe catchment area of Muddy Creek is about 5.6km2, its catchment area is heavily urbanised\nwith a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial development, and it drains into the\nCooks River near its entrance to Botany Bay. The residential development is mainly low\ndensity with some patches of medium to high density residential area consistent with urban\nconsolidation.\nMuddy Creek consists of a formed concrete channel from the Cooks River upstream to Frys\nReserve. There are a number of side channels, both open and piped, that laterally feed the\ntrunk flows into the creek. Upstream of Frys Reserve the trunk drainage system divides into a\nnumber of drainage systems combining open concrete channels with piped sections.\nThe section of Muddy Creek downstream of the Bestic Street bridge has been widened and\ndredged to form part of the lower Cooks River estuary. The tailwater level for Muddy Creek\nis controlled by the water level in the Cooks River.\nScarborough Ponds has a catchment area of about 4 km2 and a stream length of about 3.4 km.\nThere are three main ponds or wetlands, from England Street to President Avenue, from\nPresident Avenue to Barton Street, and downstream of Barton Street. The day-to-day water\nlevels of each pond are controlled at the downstream end by weirs at President Avenue,\nBarton Street and the outlet structure at Florence Street. The Florence Street outlet structure\nconnects the ponds to Botany Bay, allowing the tide to penetrate into the downstream ponds.\nThe Florence Street culvert consists of triple 1350 mm diameter pipes.\nDevelopment within the catchment is predominantly low to medium density residential\ndevelopment with localised commercial and industrial development. The areas adjacent to\nthe ponds have been landscaped into open spaces suitable for passive recreational activities.\nSome residential development on the eastern side of the ponds comes very close to the ponds.\nScarborough Ponds\nThe existing culvert under the railway line at Frys Reserve produces a throttling of the flows\nand causes Frys Reserve to act as an on-line retarding basin. The adjacent Warialda Street is\nexpected to be inundated in about a 20% AEP flood. Sydney Water has recently constructed\na new bypass culvert under the railway line to alleviate the hazard of floodwater through the\nHegarty Street underpass. The flood study examined flood behaviour for the original and\nnow existing culvert conditions under the railway line at Frys Reserve.\nThere are a large number of road and pedestrian bridges over Muddy Creek that may impact\non the flood behaviour. The major bridge crossings are at the Princes Highway, Bay Street and Bestic Street. In addition a sewer line crosses over Muddy Creek upstream of the Princes\nHighway. This sewer line would act as a major impediment to flood flows, ponding water\nagainst the concrete structure with no bypass arrangement. Some of the properties adjacent to\nthe creek have boundary fences located close to the Muddy Creek channel and these would\nimpact on flood flows by restricting the spread of water onto the floodplains.\nThe section of Muddy Creek downstream of the Bestic Street bridge has been widened and\ndredged to form part of the lower Cooks River estuary. The tailwater level for Muddy Creek\nis controlled by the water level in the Cooks River.\nScarborough Ponds\nScarborough Ponds has a catchment area of about 4 km2 and a stream length of about 3.4 km.\nThere are three main ponds or wetlands, from England Street to President Avenue, from\nPresident Avenue to Barton Street, and downstream of Barton Street. The day-to-day water\nlevels of each pond are controlled at the downstream end by weirs at President Avenue,\nBarton Street and the outlet structure at Florence Street. The Florence Street outlet structure\nconnects the ponds to Botany Bay, allowing the tide to penetrate into the downstream ponds.\nThe Florence Street culvert consists of triple 1350 mm diameter pipes.\nDevelopment within the catchment is predominantly low to medium density residential\ndevelopment with localised commercial and industrial development.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset contains the chemical and strontium isotope data of a selection of cores and cuttings from the Beetaloo Sub-basin, which were assessed from the core library of the Northern Territory Geological Survey. A total of 5 bores (Amungee NW-1, Beetaloo W1, BH 1, 12BC001, 12LE001) were sampled for either cuttings or parts of the core. The data showed that the aquifer variability for strontium isotopes is much higher than the groundwater variability (as expected) but also that waters in the CLA have a strontium isotope range that differs from the one of the aquifer rock. Furthermore the analyses allowed estimating the in-situ production of helium from radioactive decay of U and Th in the host rock and demonstrated that the high helium concentrations found in groundwater could not be produced within the aquifer itself but are due to fluid admixture from other (likely deeper) formations.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThese were analysed at the CSIRO Analytical Support Unit at Waite Campus for their elemental content by cation and Sr isotope analysis after digestion with Aqua Regia – for carbonate samples – or HF digestion – for samples with higher silicate contents such as basalts and sandstones below the CLA. Further elemental analysis, especially uranium and thorium analysis was performed using XRF analysis at CSIRO Mineral Resources.",

    "title": "Australian Government Water Recovery Programs in the Murray-Darling Basin - 2010-2019",
    "description": "To return the Murray–Darling river system to health, the Murray–Darling Basin Plan requires recovery of surface water and groundwater for the environment. The government has prioritised infrastructure investment as its preferred method of water recovery. Read more about water programs in the Murray-Darling Basin here: <http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs>http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\nThis data set provides farm-level data on projects funded to recover water under the Basin Plan. Programs included are:\r\n\r\n* Commonwealth On-Farm Further Irrigation Efficiency Program (contributes to Efficiency Measures)\r\n\r\n* QLD Healthy Headwaters Water Use Efficiency Project\r\n\r\n* NSW Irrigated Farm Modernisation\r\n\r\n* NSW Basin Pipe\r\n\r\n* Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project Two\r\n\r\n* On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Operators Program in NSW\r\n\r\n* Private Irrigation Infrastructure Program for South Australia\r\n\r\n* South Australia River Murray Sustainability Program\r\n\r\n* Victorian Farm Modernisation Program\r\n\r\nFarm-level data is not available for the following programs:\r\n\r\n* Goulburn Murray Water Connections \r\n\r\n* NSW Metering Pilot\r\n\r\n* NSW Southern Valleys Metering Project\r\n\r\n* Sunraysia Modernisation Program\r\n\r\n##Exclusions\r\nPrograms that purchase water entitlements directly without associated infrastructure works are not included. Additionally, projects where a water entitlement has __not__ been returned to the Commonwealth, for example environmental projects, are also excluded.\r\n\r\n#Data field descriptions\r\n* Program: Text - Name of program under which the on-farm works were funded.\r\n\r\n* Round: Numerical or text - Funding round under which on-farm works were funded. Text fields generally refer to \"Not applicable\" where the program did not have funding rounds, or \"Pilot\" where funding was provided under a pilot arrangement.\r\n\r\n* Delivery partner: Text - The organisation contracted to deliver the program on behalf of the Australian Government. These organisations are responsible for day-to-day management of on-farm projects, and have the contract with the farmer.\r\n\r\n* Project identifier: Numerical or text - An identifier for each project unique to that program. \r\n\r\n* Australian Government project funding (GST exclusive): Currency - Australian dollars - Australian Government Project Funding excludes both GST payments and administration components of funding. Project values may change over time as the project is finalised and subject to final audit and acquittal.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML nominal): Numeric - Megalitres - Water transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Total water savings may exceed those returned to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n* Water transferred to Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (ML LTAAY): Numeric - Megalitres in LTAAY terms - LTAAY stands for Long Term Average Annual Yield, which is a method used to standardise the calculation of expected water recoveries in the Murray–Darling Basin from different water access entitlement categories and across catchments in the Basin. This measure of water volume is relevant for measuring progress of water recovery towards meeting the sustainable diversion limits set out in the Basin Plan. The average annual yield for Murray-Darling Basin resource units is calculated using the current long-term diversion limit equivalent factors (v2.05) agreed by the Ministerial Council in November 2011, or in the absence of a factor, is modelled by the MDBA in consultation with the States. Following accreditation of the Water Resource Plans for an area, the planning assumptions used within will determine the LTAAY. \r\n\r\n* Water entitlement class: Text - The type of water that was transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Water entitlements are perpetual or ongoing entitlement to exclusive access to a share of water from a specified consumptive pool as defined in the relevant water plan. The nature and names for water entitlements differ across the Murray-Darling Basin. Further information is available at: <http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml>http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml.\r\n\r\n* State: Text - State from which the water entitlement was sourced.\r\n\r\n* SDL Resource Unit: Text - The geographical location from which the water entitlement was sourced, based on information provided by the delivery partner. Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) Resource Units are defined in legislation and available at <https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160>https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/4afa3227-8557-4bb6-944a-6494b28ae160.\r\n\r\n* Description of project: Text - Description of on-farm works undertaken. This field has been edited to ensure that it has been appropriately de-identified consistent with our obligations under the _Privacy Act 1988_.\r\n\r\n* Project  commencement date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project commenced. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as the date Funding Agreement with the Delivery Partner was signed.\r\n\r\n* Project completion date: Date - DD/MM/YYYY - Date on which the project was completed. The date taken for this purpose may vary depending on the program and includes (but is not limited to) dates such as approval date of final activity report, sub-project type closure report or closure letter. Not all projects have been completed at the time of producing this report.\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer: The Australian Government acting through the Department of Agriculture has exercised due care and skill in preparing and compiling this data. In some instances, the department has relied on the delivery agent - which is responsible for the management and implementation of the program (and has the contract with the individual farmer) - to prepare the data. Notwithstanding, the Department of Agriculture, its employees and advisers disclaim all liability, including liability for negligence and for any loss, damage, injury, expense or cost incurred by any person as a result of accessing, using or relying on any of the data to the maximum extent permitted by law._",

The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis Asset Database v1.0 on 03 August 2015 is original preliminary Asset Database\n\n\n\nThe Asset database is registered to the BA repository as an ESRI personal goedatabase (.mdb - doubling as a MS Access database) that can store, query, and manage non-spatial data while the spatial data is in a separate file geodatabase joined by AID/ElementID. \n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. A report on the WAIT process for the Hunter is included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Hunter subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. \n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_201500803.doc\", located in this filet.\n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.\n\n\n\nDetailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"SSB_asset_database_doc_201500803.doc\" located in this file.\n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1.0\t3/08/2015\tInitial database.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 03 August 2015.

    "description": "The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The experiment was part of a larger study looking at the relationship between neighbouring males and females in this species. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin. Fieldwork was conducted yearly in 18 plots (4mx4m) from November-January in 2002-2006.\n\nAll individuals within the plots were caught and carapace widths measured. This allowed the sex ratio in relation to size to be determined. The location of burrows were also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\nResults indicate that an average of 7 crabs per square metre were active on the surface at any time. The sex ratio was strongly male biased, with only 30% of crabs being female. The sex ratio also changed with size; females were significantly rarer in large size classes.",

    "description": "Storage Volumes:\nThe modelling showed that the approach developed for Terrigal and Wamberal Lagoons could be satisfactorily applied to Avoca Lagoon for the opening of 14 September 1993. In discussions with Paterson Consultants it became apparent that the storage volume of the Lagoon was critical for establishing the peak outflow from the Lagoon. A considerable effort was undertaken in this regard which revealed that a table of height/area of Avoca Lagoon was in error at a level of I.0 m. In addition it was determined that the Mike-II and RUBICON models determine different storage capacities of the lagoon. There was insufficient time to completely resolve this issue, however preliminary work suggested that the Mike- 11 model was over-calculating storage. The differences in storage make no significant difference to the peak flood level.\nComparison of Results:\nFor Wamberal, Avoca and Cockrone Lagoons the peak flood levels from both approaches should be very similar. This is because the berm height is the major control and the peak flood level is only just (0.3m) above the berm level. For Terrigal Lagoon the differences in the two approaches are likely to be more significant as the beach berm is much lower (2.5m AHD) and the peak flood level approximately 0.5m higher than the berm.\nAdditional Work:\nIt is recommended that data be collected for future openings. If the data are suitable they should be used in further verification of the hydraulic models.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains polygon, line shapefiles and point representing three Hunter terrestrial and riverine Landscape Classes respectively. The polygon and line shapefiles are provided in as both multipart and singlepart versions.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe terrestrial Landscape class polygons are sourced directly from input polygon source datasets and clipped to the Hunter PAE (which is the same as the subregion boundary).\n\n\n\nGDE landscape classes derive directly from the source NSW OoW GDE layer's Keith Form attribute, though the \"Riverine Forests\" Keith Forms are combined with the \"Forested Wetlands\" LC and the \"Mangrove Swamps\" and \"Saltmarshes\" Keith Forms are from this source are not used .  Rather \"Saline Wetlands\" and \"Seagrass\" LCs are sourced from the Marcophytes input source data. The remaining LCs in the River and Estuarine LC_Group are sourced from the NSW_Wetlands 2006 data.\n\n\n\nThe Economic Landuse LC_Group terrestrial LC polygons are mainly sourced from the ACLUM catchment landuse from the PRIMARY V7 classification, and retain the source class names except that  \"1 Conservation and natural environments\" is renamed the \"non-GDE Native Vegtation\" LC.  A further exception  is the \"Plantation and Production Forestry\" LC. This is derived from the SECONDARY_V7 classification where:\n\n\n\n\"SecondV7\" = '2.2 Production forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '3.1 Plantation forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '4.1 Irrigated plantation forestry'\n\n\n\nthe 4 input polygon layers were formatted and UNIONed. Where there was overlap the Landscape class was taken in the following order of precedence:\n\n\n\n1 DPI Estuarine Macrophytes (for Saline wetlands and Seagrass LCs)\n\n2 OoW GDE mapping (for GDE group LCs)\n\n3 NSW Wetlands 2006 (for remaining Coastal Lakes and Estuaries Group LCs)\n\n4 ACLUM 2014 (for Plantation and production forestry LC)\n\n5 GHM Vegetation mapping ( for nonGDE Native vegetation LC)\n\n6 ACLUM 2014 (for remaining Economic group LCs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Riverine LC lines are derived directly from the Perreniality source dataset.\n\n\n\nThe point Spring Landscape classes are sourced from the Assets database where the centroids of the 4 Spring Asset polygons were taken.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) HUN Landscape Classification v02.

    "description": "This dataset comprises data on the distribution and abundance of seabirds in the Southern Indian Ocean.\n\nA database of seal, whale and bird observations made from ships since the 1978/1979 austral summer shipping season. Observations are typically made from the bridge out one side of the ship. Data held in this database greater than two years old are publicly available. This work forms part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\n\nInitial datasets were from the BIOMASS cruises (ADBEX1,ADBEX2,ADBEX3, SIBEX, FIBEX).\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 2208 (ASAC 2208).\n\nThis project also incorporates several other ASAC projects.  These are:\n\nASAC_533 - The Distribution and Abundance of Seabirds at Sea in Prydz Bay in Relation to Physical and Biological Parameters\nASAC_657 - Prey Consumption by Seabirds around Heard Island in Relation to Physical and Biological Oceanographic Parameters\nASAC_725 - The role of the marginal ice zone in the consumption of marine resources by Antarctic seabirds in the Southern Indian Ocean\nASAC_1219 - Monitoring for long-term or cumulative impacts in Southern Ocean seabirds\n\nData from these projects were fed directly into project 2208.\n\nThe fields in the csv file are:\n\nwov_data_id (the internal identifier of the record)\nobservation_date (the date of observation, in ISO8601 format yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ.

    "description": "##Description\r\nThis dataset shows the annual landed catch (meaning the catch that is landed at port) in kilograms, by species and fishery, for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \r\nThese data come from AFMA catch disposal records (CDRs), and have been recorded and submitted to AFMA by commercial fishers and fish receiver permit holders when fish are landed at port. Fish discarded at sea are not included in CDRs and therefore are not included in this dataset. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThese annual catches are calculated from the date the fish was landed at a port. This means that comparisons with other datasets with different summations (for example, catch by fishing season or catch from the date the fish were removed from the ocean) may produce different results.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect catches each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as: total allowable catch, closures of fishing areas, reducing boat numbers, or banning the catch of a particular species. Similarly, changes in market demand can affect which species are targeted. \r\nCDRs are used to monitor quota (see Individual Transferable Quota)). AFMA total allowable catches (TAC)s are set for fishing seasons rather than calendar years. See catchwatch for seasonal catch to date compared to TAC for AFMA’s larger quota fisheries. Not all fisheries have CDRs, and in some fisheries the CDR program was started part-way through an annual time-period.\r\nThese catch disposal record data do not include catch by gear type. This information can be found in the “Reported landed annual catch from Commonwealth fisheries logbooks” and its metadata, which is published on data.gov.au. Note that catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only that have been recorded by fishers while at sea. It is used in combination with gear, effort, and spatial data from logbooks to inform stock assessments. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers and fish receivers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness, and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

Summary of the range of potential spatial footprints of unconventional gas resource development based on a development scenario with 1,180 wells with 4 to 8 wells per well pad. The range of potential spatial footprint areas is expressed in km2 and in percentage of the Cooper GBA region, area with relative prospectivity greater than 0 and area with relative prospectivity greater than 0.75, respectively. Spatial extent includes the entire unconventional gas resource development extent, which is a combination of development area (i.e. roads, well pads and seismic lines) that includes areas between well pads and seismic lines.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset is derived from an assessment of the maximum prospectivity of the three unconventional gas plays in the Cooper GBA region; shale gas, tight gas and deep coal.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple datasets. The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis Assessment Units dataset is a 1000 \\* 1000 m vector polygon ('vector grid') dataset that was extracted from the BA-wide vector-based box polygons generated over all the BA subregions and aligned to the kilometer marks to ensure grid cell edges fall exactly on the whole kilometer. The BA-wide assessment units dataset ensures unique identifiers for each assessment unit. This particular grid is intended for use in the NAM Subregion only and it covers the area that is 20 km greater than the Namoi analysis extent which is the combined Namoi Preliminary Assessment Extent (PAE) and the Namoi subregional boundary. It was derived to perfectly align with the interpolated groundwater model results produced by the BA Namoi groundwater model. The unique ID field for each vector polygon tile is stored in both the AUID (text) field and the au500_id (integer) field. The dataset is in Australia Albers (GDA94) (EPSG 3577).\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe purpose of the assessment units are to assist with the spatial and statistical analysis of the potential impact of coal resource development on assets and landscape classes in Namoi. They achieve this by enabling multi-scaled data to be used in the analysis while respecting the scale and associated uncertainties of the regional scale groundwater, surface water and receptor impact modelling. For Namoi, that scale is 1000 \\* 1000 m. The division of the data into assessment units also support the rapid querying, assembly and display of data in GIS and web-based interfaces.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis Assessment Units dataset is a 1000 \\* 1000 m vector polygon ('vector grid') dataset that was extracted from the BA-wide vector-based box polygons generated over all the BA subregions and aligned to the kilometer marks to ensure grid cell edges fall exactly on the whole kilometer.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the geological architecture and sedimentary fill of the Cenozoic Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in order to provide a basis for conceptualising its hydrogeology. Petroleum well data was used as a primary source of information as a large number of wells have been drilled in the region and geophysical well logs are run as part of the exploration process. These logs can provide information on distribution of lithologies downhole.   The study was divided into two parts:  1. From petroleum well data (principally Gamma Ray well log and mudlogs) Pick key stratigraphic horizons in the Lake Eyre Basin, namely the Namba Formation and Eyre Formation in South Australia and if possible their equivalents in Queensland, the Glendower Formation. The Whitula Formation, present in the northern part of the study area in Queensland, was not differentiated in this part of the study.  2. Understand the distribution of sand and shale in the various formations using models of lithology based on normalised gamma Ray log cut-offs.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset was compiled by GBA project staff for stage 3 reports.\r\nRefer to Fact sheet 21 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba.",

    "description": "Objective\nThis Floodplain Management Study defines the nature and extent of the flood hazard in the three\ncatchments. It also identifies and assesses strategies and measures aimed at reducing the impact\nof flooding on both existing and future development, and measures to prevent future development\nfrom making flooding worse.\nThe results of this Floodplain Management Study are being used to prepare a Floodplain\nManagement Plan (FPMP). The objective of the FPMP is to establish a cost-effective floodplain\nmanagement strategy for the area and to recommend a programme for implementation of the Plan.\nThe Study Brief is attached as Appendix A.\nWhat is in the Study\nThe Floodplain Management Study and Plan will not totally eliminate flooding. Flooding is a natural\nphenomenon which cannot be fully controlled by human works. In fact, excessive artificial controls\nare likely to be very costly and to have adverse environmental effects. Therefore the Floodplain\nManagement Study and Plan aim to provide a package of best management practices which give a\nbalance between reducing flood hazard and flood damages, allowing appropriate development, and\nprotecting and enhancing the environment of the floodplain.\nThis Report has been divided into the following sections:\n\nSection 1: Introduction (page 1)\nEstablishes the context and basis for the plan.\nSection 2: Background (page 5)\nDescribes the study process, including previous studies, and the background technical\ninformation which is available. It includes a review of the previous Muddy Creek Flood\nStudies.\nSection 3: Existing Flood Behaviour (page 15)\nSummarises the available data and modelling results concerning flood behaviour.\nSection 4: Social and Economic Impacts of Flooding (page 23)\nExamines the potential flood damages and other social and economic effects of flooding for a\nrange of flood events, including an extreme flood.\nSection 5: Choosing the Designated Flood (page 28)\nDiscusses the issued to be considered by Council in choosing a designated flood for\nRockdale, and recommends that the 1% AEP flood be adopted.\nSection 6: Available Floodplain Management Options (page 35)\nDescribes in broad terms the range of flood mitigation and other management works and\nother measures available to address the existing, future and residual flooding problems in the\nstudy area.\nSections 7, 8 and 9: Options for Management Areas (page 48)\nThese three sections describe in detail, for the Muddy Creek, Spring St Drain and\nScarborough Ponds catchments respectively, the feasible options and their likely benefits and\ncosts.\nSection 10: Assessment of Management Options (page 86)\nReviews the financial aspects and the justification for the proposed management measures,\nidentifies priorities and possible sources of funding. These issues will be further addressed in\nthe future Floodplain Management Plan.\nSection 11: References (page 90)\nTechnical detail which supports the main report is provided in the Appendices, in Volume 2.\n",

This dataset shows the percentage of 25 ha pixels impacted by development and non-development related disturbances. All disturbance layers were processed using a priority layering system to prevent double accounting.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nCooper: \r\n–   Seismic disturbance includes both 2D and 3D surveys.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n–   All seismic lines older than 8 years were assumed to have recovered, except for those in the Gibber geomorphology (sedimentary hills and ranges landscape class).\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n–   Other development related disturbance includes borrow pits, roads, pipelines and well pads. \r\n–   Non-development related disturbance includes aircraft facilities, bores, buildings, homesteads, mines, wells, recreation areas, reservoirs, heritage sites, storage and water tanks, vertical obstructions (e.g. towers and aerials),  wind pumps and stockyards.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n–   All disturbance layers were processed using a priority layering system to prevent double accounting. Non-development related disturbances were assigned the highest level of priority, on the assumption that these features would exist in the absence of development activity. Other development related disturbances were assigned the next level of priority, followed by seismic survey disturbance.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBeetaloo:\r\n–   Development related disturbance includes roads, rails and pipelines buffered to a total width of 10 m, and scar lines (e.g. seismic surveys) buffered to a total of 5 m.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n–   Non-development related disturbance includes fencelines and stockroutes buffered to a total width of 10 m, in addition to the features present in the 'Beetaloo GBA region non-development disturbance dataset', https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/6b4c7c0d-5bb9-4c2a-98b8-e44803fe38a2.",

    "title": "Birds Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nReceptor impact models (RIMs) are developed for specific landscape classes. The prediction of Receptor Impact Variables is a multi-stage process.  It relies on the runs from surface water and groundwater models at nodes within the analysis extent. These outputs derive directly from the hydrological model. For a given node, there is a value for each combination of hydrological response variable, future, and replicate or run number. Not all variables may be available or appropriate at every node. This differs to the quantile summary information that is otherwise used to summarise the HRV output and is also registered.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThere is a key look up table (Excel file) that lists the assessment units (AUIDs) by landscape class (or landscape group if appropriate) and notes that groundwater modelling node and runs, and the surface water modelling node and runs, that should be used for that AUID.  In some cases the AUID is only mapped to one set of hydrological modelling output. This look up table represent the AUIDs that require RIV predictions. For NAM and GAL there is a single look up table. For GLO and HUN surface and GW are provided separately. \n\nReceptor impact models (RIMs) are developed for specific landscape classes.  The hydrological response variables that a RIM within a landscape class requires are organised by the R script RIM_Prediction_CreateArray.R into an array.  The formatted data is available as an R data file format called RDS and can be read directly into R.\n\nThe R script IMIA_HUN_RIM_predictions.R applies the receptor model functions (RDS object as part of Data set 1: Ecological expert elicitation and receptor impact models for the HUN subregion) to the HRV array for each landscape class (or landscape group) to make predictions of receptor impact varibles (RIVs). Predictions of a receptor impact from a RIM for a landscape class are summarised at relevant AUIDs by the 5th through to the 95th percentiles (in 5% increments) for baseline and CRDP futures. These are available in the  HUN_RIV_quantiles_IMIA.csv data set. RIV predictions are further summarised and compared as boxplots (using the R script boxplotsbyfutureperiod.R) and as (aggregated) spatial risk maps using GIS.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2018) HUN Predictions of receptor impact variables v01.

    "description": "An International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis, produced daily on an operational basis at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology using optimal interpolation (OI) on a regional 1/12 degree grid over the Australian region (20N - 70S, 60E - 170W). This Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA) v1.0 system blends infra-red SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA and METOP polar-orbiting satellites, microwave SST observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2) on GCOM-W, and in situ data from ships, and drifting and moored buoys from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS).  \n\nAll SST observations are filtered for those values suspected to be affected by diurnal warming by excluding cases which have experienced recent surface wind speeds of below 6 m/s during the day and less than 2 m/s during the night, thereby resulting in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free of diurnal warming effects.",

    "title": "Amphibians Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for November 1988. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents key results from a national survey of 1,585 recreational boat operators about their vessel biofouling management actions. The purpose was to inform a national communication approach to reducing the risk of marine pest translocation via biofouling of recreational boats in the Australian marine environment. \r\n\r\n Biofouling is a term for the growth on a boat's hull that can move invasive pests and diseases from one marine environment to another, which is a biosecurity risk. \r\n\r\n Australia's national approach to domestic marine pest biosecurity relies on voluntary uptake of the national biofouling management guidelines by recreational vessel operators, to prevent and manage biofouling growth. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The study found that a large proportion of recreational boat operators already undertake a range of effective biofouling management actions on a regular basis, with more than 60 per cent using best-practice approaches, such as regularly cleaning the boat hull and niche areas of the boat, renewing anti-fouling coatings each year and capturing biofouling waste after cleaning. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents demonstrated considerable interest in doing the right thing to protect the environment. The analysis presents opportunities to develop messaging that could be used as part of future engagement strategies with recreational boaters to influence behaviour voluntarily and promote best practice biofouling management activities.

    "description": "ACT Canopy Estimate Statistics 2020 for blocks, divisions and road polygons are derived from the ACT Canopy Cover 2020 footprint dataset (available soon). The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area). The total tree canopy cover estimate for Canberra for 2020 is based on the footprint of all urban divisions (suburbs): 22.5%.

The point clouds were processed by the ACT Government with ArcGIS to produce ACT Canopy Cover footprint for vegetation above 3m. Canopy modelling was completed at 1m resolution. The canopy footprints were then augmented to block, division and road polygon coverage statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate system: GDA 2020 MGA Zone 55.\n\nTemporal coverage: April 2020\n\nUpdate schedule: every 5 years\n\n\n\nTile photo by Mark Jekabsons, Trees over Gungahlin\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveat: Comparison of the ACT 2020 Canopy Cover to the 2015 is not comparable due to differences in methodology, including differences in resolution and point density, and time of year the LiDAR was captured. The 2015 data was captured in late Autumn, whereas 2020 was captured in early Autumn.",

Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\n1m diameter cages were constructed and stocked with 4 crabs of the species Uca capricornis. During one semilunar cycle, from one neap tide to the next, digital photographs were taken of 22 crabs (10 males, 12 females) active in the cages at approximately low tide. Photos were examined to observe any colour changes on a day to day basis. \n\nThe results show that Uca capricornis do not rythmically change their colour or pattern between moults. Although some individuals did exhibit a slight variation, by brightening or darkening existing colours, there was no apparent trend in the number of crabs either brightening or darkening with respect to the time in the cycle.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for grain producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Grain producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that grew at least 40 hectares of grain, oilseed or pulse crops. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n The AAGIS is funded by The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC), Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. \r\n\r\n This report was commissioned and funded by the GRDC. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income for grain producing farms is estimated to have increased by 7 per cent in 2014-15 to an average of $229 000 a farm as higher total cash receipts more than offset a small rise in total cash costs. The average rate of return was 2.8 per cent. In 2015-16 average farm cash income is estimated to have increased further to around $258 000 and the average rate of return to have increased to around 3.5 per cent. \r\n• Specialist grain farms (grain farms that obtained more than 50 per cent of their total receipts from crops sales) recorded an average farm cash income of $304 000 in 2014-15; for non-specialist farms it was about $124 000. On average, from 2000-01 to 2015-16, specialist farms recorded farm cash incomes around $125 000 higher than non-specialist farms. \r\n• The Western region recorded higher average farm incomes and rates of return than the Northern and Southern regions in 2014-15. The Western region is estimated to have again been the best performing region in 2015-16. \r\n• The cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth - at 1.8 per cent - of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity include new plant varieties, better water management and improvements in cropping equipment technology. \r\n",

    "description": "The _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights.\r\n\r\n_Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ presents information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes of ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology described in the ABARES report _Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights_ (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/AusIndigLandForestEstate_v1.0.0.pdf). The Indigenous land dataset is then combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the _Forests of Australia (2023)_ dataset. The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThe Indigenous estate land attributes are as follows:\r\n\r\n* __​Indigenous owned__: freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land or forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan\r\n* __Other special rights__: land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements, and legislated special cultural use provisions.​\r\n\r\nThe _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ dataset shows that a total of:\r\n\r\n* 154 million hectares of land in Australia (20%) is Indigenous owned, of which 24 million hectares is forest\r\n* 192 million hectares of land in Australia (25%) is under some form of Indigenous management, comprising 156 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 36 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed. Of this, 31 million hectares is forest, comprising 20.7 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 10.6 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed\r\n* 443 million hectares of land in Australia (58%) is subject to other special rights for Indigenous peoples and communities, of which 62 million hectares if forest.\r\n\r\nThese areas of land are not mutually exclusive: there is substantial overlap between Indigenous owned land, Indigenous managed or co-managed land, and land subject to other special rights. Spatial intersection of these attributes confirms the total area of land in the Indigenous estate in Australia as at 2023 was 536 million hectares (70%), and the total area of forest in the Indigenous estate as 70 million hectares, as reported in Indicator 6.4a Area of forest to which Indigenous people have use and rights that protect their special values and are recognised through formal and informal management regimes (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/criterion-6/indicator-6.4a) of _Australia’s State of the Forests Report_ (available at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr).",

This record contains 3 datasets. The first two contain data relating to wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure for the time periods 02/11/88-29/01/90 and 10/08/90-31/10/90. The third dataset provides cross- and long-shore wind velocities for the first sampling period between 02/11/88-29/01/90.\n\nIn these datasets samples have been averaged to provide an hourly mean. Data is presented in the 'ocean format' i.e.  \"direction going to\".\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

The boundaries are generally based on eastern and central NSW Local Government Area boundaries as defined in the PSMA Administrative Boundaries dataset 2016, combined with the Western Division boundary as defined in the Crown Lands Management Act 2016. These boundaries generally align with the defined Local Land Services Regions 2013, with areas in the northern inland, central eastern, central western, central southern parts of the state combined into specific BCT Regions. Deviations from the Western Division dataset occur at Walgett, Bogan and Balranald LGAs and from the LGA dataset at Hilltops, Carrathool, Hay and Bogan. Northern Tablelands and North West Local Land Services Region areas combined into Northern Inland; Hunter and Greater Sydney Local Land Services Region areas combined into Sydney-Hunter; Central Tablelands and Central West combined into Central West: Riverina and Murray combined into Murray-Riverina; South East region maintaining LLS boundary (before LGAs were combined into Hilltops).\nCredits",

    "title": "Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (AHGF) (Geofabric) V3x",
    "description": "The AHGF: Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) is a specialised\r\nGeographic Information System (GIS). It identifies the spatial relationships\r\nof important hydrological features such as rivers, catchments, waterbodies, aquifers\r\ncanals and monitoring points.\r\n\r\nBy detailing the spatial dimensions of these hydrology features and how they are connected, it is possible to analyse how water flows, is stored, transported and used through the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe enduring nature of the Geofabric is based on a set of contracted nodes (points) which represent important hydrological features in the landscape. A subset of the contracted nodes is used to create a simplified node-link network with associated contracted catchments. There is also a hierarchy of catchments, as well as alternate representations to meet varied user requirements and a toolset that supports customisation.\r\n\r\nThe Geofabric includes 6 products;\r\nSurface Hydrology Network\r\nSurface Hydrology Cartography\r\nSurface Hydrology Catchments\r\nHydrology Reporting Catchments\r\nHydrology Reporting Regions\r\nGroundwater Cartography\r\n\r\n\r\nSurface Hydrology Network product:\r\n\r\nNetwork representation of hydrological features, including over 2.5 million stream segments and 6000 gauging stations, with the ability to trace the drainage the network both upstream and downstream and identify contributing catchment areas. Can also be used with the Geofabric Toolset to create customised catchments and networks.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hydrology Network product provides a set of related feature classes to be used as the basis for production of consistent hydrological surface stream network analysis. This product contains a topographically consistent representation of the (major) surface water features of Australia (excluding external territories). Contains six datasets: Waterbody, Network Stream, Network Node, Catchment, Network Connectivity (Upstream) and Network Connectivity (Downstream).\r\n\r\n\r\nSurface Hydrology Cartography product:\r\n\r\nCartographic representation of surface hydrological features, based on best available mapped features, approximating 1:100,000 scale, for contextual purposes and production of consistent hydrological cartographic maps.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hydrology Cartography product contains a geometric representation of the (major) surface water features of Australia (excluding external territories). Primarily, these are natural surface hydrology features but the product also contains some man-made features (notably reservoirs, canals and other hydrographic features. Contains thirteen datasets: Waterbody, Mapped Stream, Mapped Node, Dam, Structure, Canal Line, Monitoring Point, Water Pipeline, Hydro Point, Hydro Line, Hydro Area, Mapped Connectivity (Upstream) and Mapped Connectivity (Downstream).\r\n\r\n\r\nSurface Hydrology Catchment product:\r\n\r\nNational catchment boundaries (NCB) derived from the 1 second Digital Elevation Model using ANUDEM, with approximately 7 million base level catchments, designed to represent geographic catchment boundaries that have a hydrological relationship to surface water features.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hydrology Catchments product provides a hierarchy of catchments, with base AHGFCatchment defining a catchment for every stream segment contained within the Geofabric Surface Network along coastal draining and sink basins. ANUDEM processing provided an additional 2 AHGFCatchment aggregated features, these being NCB Level 2 Drainage Basin Group and NCB Level 1 Drainage Division. These 2 aggregate layers are somewhat superseded by Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions; River Region and AWRA Drainage Division. Contains three datasets: Catchments, NCB level 1 Drainage Division and NCB Level 2 Drainage Basin Group.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrology Reporting Catchment product:\r\n\r\nGeofabric Hydrology Reporting Catchments comprises two related views of hydrological catchments to be used for modelling, analysis and reporting purposes. Firstly, a topological network view of hydrological catchments represented as a simplified node-link network using a subset of the contracted nodes (AHGFNode) and the links (AHGFLink) between them; and secondly, a catchments view of the hydrology using the contracted catchments (AHGFContractedCatchment).\r\n\r\nThe AHGFNode feature class contains contracted nodes that are points of hydrological significance that carry identity. They include the confluence of major named streams, coastal stream termini, waterbody inflow and outflows, important gauging stations and inland sinks. The AHGFLink feature class provides the topological connectors between a subset of contracted nodes that participate in the simplified node-link network. The AHGFContractedCatchment feature class contains catchment polygons for the subset of contracted nodes that participate in the simplified node link network. These catchments are part of a hierarchy that can be aggregated and traced based on upstream relationships. Contains five datasets: Node, Link, Contracted Catchment, Node-Link Connectivity (upstream), and Node-Link Connectivity (downstream).\r\n\r\n\r\nGeofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions product:\r\n\r\nReporting regions based on aggregations of contracted catchments, similar to 1997 Australian Water Resource Council (AWRC) Drainage Division and River Basin boundaries, as well as important Gauging Station contributing catchments, for provision of a stable set of reporting boundaries at both the national and regional scale.\r\n\r\nIt contains three levels of hydrological reporting regions. The first delineates national level drainage divisions, the second delineates regional level river regions across Australia and the third important Gauging Station catchments that represent upstream contributing catchments, which are also used in hydrological modelling. Contains five datasets: AWRA Drainage Division, AWRA Drainage Division Contracted Catchment Lookup, River Region, River Regions Contracted Catchment and Station Catchments.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroundwater Cartography product:\r\n\r\nGroundwater Cartography is a national collation of existing groundwater mapping including aquifer boundaries and properties (structure contours, salinity, outcrop and yield). It has been developed to collate and integrate state and regional groundwater mapping datasets across Australia. It provides foundation groundwater datasets essential for groundwater assessments, management, planning, modelling and research.\r\n\r\nThe data set is intended to be used at the regional to national scale and does not support local scale groundwater applications. Contains five datasets: Aquifer Boundary, Aquifer Outcrop, Aquifer Contour, Aquifer Salinity and Aquifer Yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The processes undertaken to compile this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. This dataset contains raster datasets derived from Geoscience Australia's Barest Earth product. Outputs contained are Gozzard Ratio, Iron/Clay ratio, Sultans Formula and DPCA products.  These products provide users with information regarding the makeup of outcropping geology and regolith in the Beetaloo GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nRaster analysis was carried out in ESRI's ArcGIS software.  Gozzard ratio, developed by Tapley and Gozzard, has been applied to the parent dataset and is used to provide finer subdivision in areas where iron and clay are important components of the regolith.  Iron Clay ratio was applied to the parent dataset and is used to differentiate between different types of iron and clay.  The Sultan's formula was applied to the parent dataset and is used to highlight ultramafic rocks in arid terrain (Sultan et al., 1987), and is broadly applicable to mapping geological features.  DPCA is the Directed Principle Components Analysis has been applied to the parent dataset.  The DPCA formula applied was developed by Fraser and Green.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

Thousands of tests are run and these measurements are used to calculate average speeds achieved and other metrics for different volunteer groups, such as volunteers on the NBN fixed-line services and volunteers on NBN fixed wireless services. The summary data released includes test results for all Whiteboxes used in MBA Report 25 for download, upload, latency and outages metrics. The results are de-identified to protect the privacy of the volunteers and the integrity of the MBA program. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for July 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents results of the 2015 Northern Prawn Fishery survey, comprising survey based estimates of financial and economic performance for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial years, as well as non-survey based estimates of economic performance for the fishery in the 2014-15 financial year. Other indicators presented in the report include the total factor productivity index, input costs and ouput prices and management costs. \r\n\r\n The Australian fisheries economic indicators report expands on and takes the place of the former Australian fisheries surveys report. The information and analysis contained in these reports are accessed by policy makers, managers, researchers and industry. Alongside the usual detailed information about the financial performance of the average vessel and the overall economic performance of the fishery, this report also provides analysis of additional economic indicators for the Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery. The construction of these indicators draw upon the data collected through the fisheries survey program. Together with the financial and economic performance information, these indicators help to form a comprehensive picture of the economic performance of the Northern Prawn Fishery over a number of years. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The report has found that profit at full equity, a profit indicator that assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, increased for the average boat in the fishery between 2012-13 and 2013-14, from $239 066 to $382 939. \r\n• Net economic returns (NER) for the fishery rose from $5.2 million in 2012-13 to $12.3 million in 2013-14. The increase in NER from 2012-13 to 2013-14 was primarily driven by faster growth in fishing income than in fishing costs. The growth in fishing income was driven by increased landings of tiger prawns and banana prawns offsetting slightly lower beach prices for each. \r\n• The report indicates that total factor productivity (TFP) improved from 2004-05 to 2013-14. A strong relationship is evident between TFP and landed banana prawn catch, which is in turn largely dependent on seasonal conditions. Improved productivity also reflects the targeting of maximum economic yield (MEY) in the tiger prawn component of the fishery from 2004-05, effort reduction targets by management and the structural adjustment package (completed 2006-07) removing excess capital in the industry. \r\n",

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - 3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)\nSpatial Accuracy Notes - RMSE values of 0.081m in X and 0.027m in Y to existing control.\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - Cordalba_5m_Ortho_DTM.img. The DNRME DEM for Cordalba was used without any edits. No alterations were made.\nTile Size / Grid - SW_123000_4567000_1km SW - Refers to the south-west coordinate of the tile (bottom left); 123000 - Coordinate easting of south-west tile corner; 4567000 - Coordinate northing of south-west tile corner\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "When digital television was introduced to Australia, the mySwitch website was set up to help viewers and installers retune digital televisions as analog services were decommissioned. By entering a street address into mySwitch, viewers can see if television signal coverage is available and, if so, which transmitter is likely to provide the best signal. When the digital TV restack process was completed, mySwitch was retained to assist viewers and installers to retune TVs to the new channel arrangements.\r\n\r\nmySwitch relies on comprehensive, terrain-based coverage modelling generated by the ACMA’s state-of-the-art coverage prediction tools. This data has now been made available to the public, and may be used to support other projects or applications.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while the mySwitch data has been updated from time to time as new TV transmissions are commissioned, the transmitter data and files reflect coverage predictions as at 2014 for the great majority of sites. Therefore, there may be some differences between the mySwitch data and the current situation.

    "description": "\n\n\nGrasslands of the Territory include a rich assemblage of flora and fauna species that combine into a unique ecosystem. These grasslands are a priority for protection and management as they contribute to our natural biodiversity, our history and heritage, and local amenity and community. Natural Temperate Grasslands are an Endangered Ecological Community in the ACT (Nature Conservation Act 2014) and Critically Endangered Ecological Community under the EPBC Act 1999. Other native and exotic grasslands in the ACT can also have some conservation significance as they support important populations of threatened fauna and flora.\n\nNatural Temperate Grassland occurs in areas where few trees grow because of factors such as low temperatures, low rainfall and infertile or clay soils. Only 2% to 10% of the lower elevation grasslands in south-eastern Australia remain in high ecological condition, eight grassland species of the ACT are listed as endangered or vulnerable and some of the constituent plants and animals are under threat. Temperate grasslands are considered one of the most threatened Australian ecosystems. <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>. Extensive areas of native grassland in Namadgi National Park are to be field checked to determine whether they qualify as Natural Temperate Grassland. \n\nMore information on threatened species occurring in grasslands in the ACT can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species</a>\n\nThe 2017 ACT <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/2547440/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans-2017.pdf\">Native Grassland Conservation Strategy</a> and associated action plans guide the protection, management and restoration of native grasslands and its component species for the next 10 years. See a <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/act-native-grassland-conservation-strategy-and-action-plans\">summary of the strategy</a>. This strategy supersedes Action Plan 28 ACT Lowland Native Grassland Conservation Strategy (Environment ACT, 2005).\n\nFit for purpose: This mapping is fit for use at a 1:10000 scale. Significant advances are being made towards a high resolution vegetation map for the ACT that is suitable for use at scales ranging from broad regional planning to local planning and property planning. However, Natural Temperate Grassland condition can fluctuate widely depending on seasonal conditions and thus boundaries and presence may fluctuate.\n\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the layers are free from error. © ACT Government\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The Ourimbah Creek Floodplain Risk Management Plan has been prepared for the Central Coast Council in accordance with the NSW Government’s Floodplain Development Manual 2005 (Reference 1) and:\n Is based on a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of factors that affect and are\naffected by the use of flood prone land;\n Represents the considered opinion of the local community on how to best manage its flood risk and its flood prone land; and\n Provides a long-term path for the future development of the community.\n\nThe Ourimbah Creek catchment is located on the Central Coast of NSW, approximately 90km north of Sydney. Covering a total area of 160 km2, the majority of the catchment is contained in the Wyong Shire Local Government Area (LGA), with 8 km² of the catchment contained in the Gosford City LGA to the south. In 2016 the two councils were combined into the Central Coast Council.\n\nFlooding has been recorded periodically since the 1930’s but there are many more recorded instances of flooding in Tuggerah Lakes. It is possible that the incidence of flooding has historically been under reported along Ourimbah Creek and its tributaries. In recent times there have been two significant events, in February 1990 and June 2007. In both these events there was extensive flooding in the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Wyong/Gosford regions.\n\nFlooding causes significant hardship, including both tangible and intangible damages, to the community and for this reason the Central Coast Council has undertaken a program of studies to address the management of the flood problem in accordance with the NSW Government’s Floodplain Development Manual 2005 (Reference 1).",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

The study was commissioned by the Albury City Council to inform the design of the South Albury levee upgrade. \n\nThis report supersedes previous flood studies for the Murray River at Albury and provides a revised flood frequency analysis of design flows, including calibration and sensitivity testing of the hydraulic model. The modelling shows that the proposed levee upgrades lead to improved flood protection in South Albury for events up to and including the 1% AEP (Annual Exceedance Probability) event. The flood mapping produced is intended to replace existing Murray River flood mapping and is considered fit for purpose to inform the levee's design.",

    "title": "Combined Effects of near-future temperature increase and ocean acidification on coral reef foraminifera Marginopora vertebralis and Heterostegina depressa. (NERP TE 5.2, AIMS and MARUM)",
    "description": "This dataset measures 5 effects of temperature and pH stressors (individual and combined) on tropical Foraminifera. The effects measured are: respiration, survivorship, growth, chl-a content and photochemistry. The study was conducted in 2011 and the data is provided as 5 single sheet spreadsheets.\n\nWarming and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry alter marine coastal ecosystems at an accelerating pace. Here we investigate the individual effects as well as the interaction of two stressors, temperature and pH on two species of benthic coral reef Foraminifera. This study consisted of a 7 week aquarium experiment manipulating temperature and pH changes and measuring survivorship, growth, photosynthesis, respiration and chl-a content in these benthic coral reef Foraminifera.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSpecimens were collected from Orpheus Island in the central Great Barrier Reef in September 2011. H. depressa was collected at a depth of 8¿12 m from coral rubble at Cattle Bay (18°34¿08¿¿ S 146°28¿55¿¿ E) and M. vertebralis at a depth of 0¿1 m (below Lowest Astronomical Tide) from turf algae-covered rocks at Hazard Bay (18°38¿58¿¿ S 146°29¿11¿¿ E). Both species were acclimated to laboratory conditions in tanks with moderate flow-through conditions (same as used in experimental setup) under low-light conditions (10 µmol photons m-2 s-1) for a period of 3 weeks.\n12 flow-through aquaria (working volume 17.5 L) were installed in a constant temperature room, and the experiment was carried out over a period of 53 d.\n\nSpecimens were kept inside custom made flow-through housings in each aquarium to achieve higher flow conditions more closely mimicking their habitat than in previous experiments. Flow-through housings contained two levels made from two standard 6-well cell culturing plates with flow-through lids. Twenty-four specimens (four specimens per well) of H. depressa were put in the lower level and the same number of M. vertebralis in the top level.\n\nFor each temperature (28 and 31 ºC) and pCO2 level (~790 µatm, pHNIST 7.9 and ~490 µatm, pHNIST 8.1), three replicate tanks were used; replicate tanks were randomly allocated to treatments. Seawater was pumped from the ocean into the laboratory, filtered to 5 µm, and stored in four header tanks where it was modified to the desired experimental conditions. Manual temperature and pH measurements were performed once to twice per day. Water samples for total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) determinations were taken weekly and analysed by AIMS Laboratory Services.\n\nFlow rates into the individual wells were recorded before and after the experiment, ranging between 180 and 220 mL min-1. Velocity of the water flow varied from 4.2¿5.2 9 10-1 m s-1 at the inlet (Ø 0.3 cm) to 3.1¿3.8 9 10-3 m s-1 at the outlet (Ø 3.5 cm). The flow rates between inlet and outlet are in the same range as those measured in situ over dead coral rubble and sea grass.\n\nFlow-through housings were made containing two levels so that one species could be kept in the top level exposed to higher light levels than the species in the lower level. Light levels were chosen for each species separately because of their known distributions and different light saturation points determined by pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry. PAM fluorometry results for M. vertebralis indicated a maximum saturating irradiance (Ek) between 100 and 140 µmol photons m-2 s-1 and for H. depressa between 40 and 60 µmol photons m-2 s-1 (Ziegler and Uthicke 2011). The light levels used in the experiment were chosen to fall below the Ek values by Ziegler and Uthicke (2011) and P¿I curve Pmax values determined by Vogel and Uthicke (2012) and were selected to correspond to levels which have shown no changes in mortality rates or chlorophyll a concentrations in previous experimental manipulations of the studied species.\n\nFurther detail can be found in this publication:\nSchmidt, C., Kucera, M., & Uthicke, S.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nGloucester Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input  and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.  The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of  equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. The surface water component of the zone was derived by selecting assessment units within 150m or sharing an alluvial floodplain with an impacted river reach.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing tweaks were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nA selection buffer of 300m was created from the potentially impacted reaches of the surface water modelling interpolated reaches polylines. This was unioned with polygons in the alluvium layer that intersected with the potentially impacted reaches to create the composite selection layer (included in component layer folder). The composite selection layer was manually edited to constrain the extent to that reasonably potentially influenced by changes in river. \n\n\n\nThe composite selection layer was used to select, by intersection, AUs that represented the surface water\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) GLO ZoPHC and component layers 20170217.

    "description": "Live release 1.0\r\n\r\nThis APS Career Pathfinder dataset contains the capability frameworks, role definitions and learning catalogues used by the [APS Career Pathfinder](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/aps-career-pathfinder-tool) tool to facilitate career exploration and development in the Australian Public Service (APS).\r\n\r\nThe role definitions include typical APS roles, which describe the skills and general capability requirements typically found in APS jobs based on those roles. You can use these definitions to determine potential career pathways and identify skills gaps and learning solutions that may help fill those gaps.\r\n\r\nThe focus at present is on digital roles, and therefore the capability frameworks, role definitions and the learning catalogue we are using primarily address digital, data and ICT. However, the APS Career Pathfinder tool has the capability to work with other types of capability framework, with roles and leaning mapped accordingly, so that it can support career exploration and development in potentially any area of capability.\r\n\r\nWe’ve defined roles according to skills drawn from capability frameworks, primarily [SFIA](https://sfia-online.org/en/), the Skills Framework for the Information Age. We use additional capability frameworks where relevant, including other skills frameworks (like [CIISec](https://www.ciisec.org/), the Chartered Institute of Information Security skills framework, and the [DCF](https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-data-capability-framework) Data Capability Framework), knowledge frameworks (like our simple knowledge magnitude scale), and behaviours (using the APS Work Level Standards). Additional details about roles include:\r\n\r\n* a brief description of each role or discipline\r\n* a mapping to the APS Job Family Model\r\n* a mapping to areas of interest\r\n* alternative names the roles may have\r\n* link to a ‘day in the life of’ profile for certain roles\r\n* relative role demand\r\n* link to learning solutions related to each role\r\n\r\nWe may define roles as typical APS roles, which are not specific to any agency, or as agency-specific roles. Agencies can include their role definitions in this dataset by sending their definitions to the contact email below.\r\n\r\nPlease send requests to change or augment any of this data to the contact email below. We may consult with our community before including them.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes the full SFIA framework, reproduced and made available through the [SFIA-AU](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/skills-framework-information-age) license.

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait have globally significant seagrass habitat that provide food for threatened dugong and turtle, and habitat for commercially important fish and prawns. Key to understanding, managing, mitigating risk, and monitoring seagrass in this remote region is reliable data on seagrass distribution and species composition and how these changes through time. Data on seagrass has been collected in these areas since the 1980s, but data location and storage from these efforts remains disparate, in many cases not publicly available, and in some cases has already been lost. Our study will compile, validate and synthesize historical seagrass spatial data to create a publicly available database accessible on eAtlas. This product will provide end-users with a valuable spatial resource to assist management and monitoring of seagrass in the region. \n\n(i) Identify key seagrass habitat and migration corridors for dugong and turtles in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\n(ii) Identify regions where seagrass information is deficient (knowledge gaps)\n(iii) create a foundations for models assessing exposure to risk (water quality and other environmental impacts, climate change, etc)\n(iv) provide essential information for management, planning, and developing long-term monitoring plans\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • seagrass data [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

    "description": "The Study Area\n\nThe study area comprises four sub-catchments within the Canterbury-Bankstown Council Local Government Area (LGA) that drain to Prospect Creek:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Georges Hall Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering approximately 145 hectares, this area predominantly features residential land with notable reserves, such as Crest Reserve and Garrison Point Reserve.</li>\n<li><strong>Lansdowne Sub-Catchment</strong>: Spanning 243 hectares, it includes residential areas alongside significant bushland and parklands, such as Lansdowne Park and Mirambeena Regional Park.</li>\n<li><strong>Miller Road Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering 50 hectares, this area includes residential zones with no defined water channels, relying on overland flow paths and a piped drainage network.</li>\n<li><strong>Villawood Sub-Catchment</strong>: The largest at approximately 740 hectares, this area comprises residential and industrial zones with a network of concrete-lined open channels.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA map of the study area is shown in Figure 1-2.\n\nConsultation\n\nCommunity and stakeholder consultation has been integral to this project. Key consultation activities included:\n<ul>\n<li>Engagement with the Floodplain Management Committee throughout the project phases;</li>\n<li>Community feedback collected through online surveys, email submissions, and in-person sessions, with a total of 67 recorded responses during initial consultation;</li>\n<li>Public exhibition of the draft study and plan, incorporating input from 57 engagements; and</li>\n<li>Targeted discussions on identified issues, such as voluntary house raising and stormwater management concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n\nModelling of Flood Behaviour\n\nCanterbury-Bankstown Council has implemented a consistent and advanced approach for modelling stormwater catchment flooding. The methodology integrates a dynamically linked 2D/1D hydrodynamic model (TUFLOW), which simulates flood behaviours with precision.\n\nThe TUFLOW model uses a two-dimensional grid to represent surface terrain while incorporating one-dimensional elements for stormwater pipes and channels. Overflow from drainage elements is accounted for, allowing flows to spill onto the grid and replicate overland and sheet flows across floodplains.\n\nFlood Risk Mapping &amp; Development Controls\n\nFlood risk mapping for the Prospect Creek sub-catchments categorises the area into three flood risk precincts, guiding development controls:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Areas prone to significant flood damages and evacuation challenges, where development is generally restricted.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Zones with moderate risk, where damages can be mitigated with suitable controls.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Regions with minimal risk where most developments are permitted, subject to planning regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAdditionally, overland flow precincts have been identified to account for shallow inundation areas, enabling tailored development controls.\n\nThe Flood Problem\n\nA comprehensive flood damages database was developed to evaluate flood impacts and inform flood mitigation strategies. Key findings include:\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 2,667 properties are impacted in the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event, with over 60% located in the Villawood sub-catchment.</li>\n<li>Average Annual Damages (AAD) across the sub-catchments exceed $93.7 million, with the Villawood sub-catchment contributing a significant portion due to its low-lying industrial areas.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFlood mitigation measures were assessed, and recommendations for effective floodplain management have been outlined to address these challenges.",

It comprises a digital map showing the locations of Windmill Islands lichenometric observations and a linked digital database containing the maximum thallus size recorded at each location. It includes observations of lichens growing on nunataks for which the time of deglaciation is known and observations of lichens growing on supraglacial moraine ridges for which the time of formation is not known. This dataset thus provides the basis for a relative chronology of moraine development based on the assumption that the growth of the lichen thallus has been constant since the time of deglaciation.\n\n      \n\nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe Steedman EMS-16 Meteorological Station housing an R.M. Young anemometer and YSI barometer was set up near Governor Head, Jervis Bay (35.133S, 150.762E). The site was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nBetween 3nd Nov 1989 and 24th September 1991 the station recorded wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure. \n\nThe Meteorological Station recorded 15 minute vector averages of the wind velocity and 15 minute values of air pressure. Data is presented in the oceanographic format i.e. 'direction going to'. The datasets titled 'Additional meteorological data' provide information on the average wind speed and direction, as well as the maximum gusts.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

Photography of the harems on North and South Spit and the Four Bays region provided the opportunity of verifying ground counts made on the same day. All exposures were made at approximately 60 knots ground-speed.  Flying heights were generally confined to below 350' at Atlas Cove by a low cloud cover and to 500' at Spit by strong winds at higher altitudes.\n\nFlight lines and photo centres representing the Roll 1 aerial photography (Film ANTC1082) are included in the aerial photography data available for download (see provided URL) and have Qinfo = 760. The flight lines and photo centres are provided as shapefiles and Qinfo is an attribute of the shapefiles. \n\nSee the Quality field for comments about the flight lines and photo centres.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) has prints of some Roll 1 frames. They were stitched together, and glued to a presentation board but have since been separated from the board and stored in an archival box. Print = Y in the attribute table of the photo centres shapefile indicates there is a print for that frame. The prints are not available for loan outside the AAD. \n\nContact the Australian Antarctic Data Centre for access to the prints:\n\nhttp://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/requests/request.cfm",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n As part of a three year (2015-16 to 2017-18) joint project between Forest and Wood Products Australia (FWPA) and ABARES, ABARES developed quarterly sales volume forecasts for selected wood products from the FWPA Softwood Data series. This technical report documents the methods and assumption underlying ABARES forecasts. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The FWPA Softwood Data Series (FWPA 2016) was established in 2002 by Australia's major softwood sawmilling companies and provides monthly sales volumes for 44 detailed product categories. ABARES was tasked to estimate quarterly forecasts for four specific wood products; untreated structural pine less than 120mm, untreated structural pine greater than 120mm, termite treated structural pine and landscape wood products. These forecasts will be made available for members of the FWPA data dashboard. \r\n\r\n\r\n• The econometric models estimated in the report are not based on formal structural economic models of the relevant wood product markets. Instead, they are simple, statistically robust, predictive models that are based on historical relationships and patterns observed over the sample period. \r\n\r\n\r\n• In interpreting or using ABARES forecasts it should be noted, that the FWPA Softwood Data series do not include all producers in the industry and the number of participating producers is changing over time. As such, the series are not representative of national production or sales and the effects of new entrants in the data series has the potential to affect the validity of the estimated models. The models estimated in this study, and approaches used to generate forecasts, will be periodically reviewed by ABARES in order to improve the accuracy of forecasts over time. \r\n",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Australian Commonwealth fisheries are managed with the objective of maximising economic returns to the Australian community - an objective that may be served by increasing the efficiency of the fishing fleet. This paper presents a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. ABARES used boat-level data to explore the potential of the SFA approach to determine the efficiency of the fleet and find reasons for any inefficiencies. \r\n\r\n This preliminary work: • indicates significant inefficiency in the CTS fleet \r\n• provides some support for the hypothesis that a structural adjustment in 2006 resulted in less efficient boats leaving the fishery, which led to improved economic returns \r\n• shows that interannual effects, such as stock availability, management changes and technical change, play a large role in the estimated frontier and must be disentangled from each other in further work to provide more information for managers.\r\n",

    "description": "The survey was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219) during 1999/00 summer at Casey during resupply.  GPS data were collected for all snow petrel nests located during intensive searches of ice-free areas in the Casey Station extended recreation area.\n\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\n\nThe data are a subset of the data available for downloading, the data with dataset id = 182. Each feature has a Qinfo value which can be used to access data quality information.\n\nPublic summary for project 1219:\n\nThis project provides population data on Antarctic and Subantarctic seabirds that permit assessments to be made of natural population trends at local to regional scales, so that changes in populations due to to human disturbance, such as station activities and helicopter operations can be identified.",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) Southern Surveyor collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 3-hourly. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains the data and scripts to generate the hydrological response variables for surface water in the Clarence Moreton subregion as reported in CLM261 (Gilfedder et al. 2016).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nFile CLM_AWRA_HRVs_flowchart.png shows the different files in this dataset and how they interact. The python and R-scripts are written by the BA modelling team to, as detailed below, read, combine and analyse the source datasets CLM AWRA model, CLM groundwater model V1 and CLM16swg Surface water gauging station data within the Clarence Moreton Basin to create the hydrological response variables for surface water as reported in CLM2.6.1 (Gilfedder et al. 2016).\n\n\n\nR-script HRV_SWGW_CLM.R reads, for each model simulation, the outputs from the surface water model in netcdf format from file Qtot.nc (dataset CLM AWRA model) and the outputs from the groundwater model, flux_change.csv (dataset CLM groundwater model V1) and creates a set of files in subfolder /Output for each GaugeNr and simulation Year:\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_all.csv and CLM_GaugeNR_Year_baseline.csv: the set of 9 HRVs for GaugeNr and Year for all 5000 simulations for baseline conditions\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_CRDP.csv: the set of 9 HRVs for GaugeNr and Year for all 5000 simulations for CRDP conditions (=AWRA streamflow - MODFLOW change in SW-GW flux)\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_minMax.csv: minimum and maximum of HRVs over all 5000 simulations\n\n\n\nPython script CLM_collate_DoE_Predictions.py collates that information into following files, for each HRV and each maxtype (absolute maximum (amax), relative maximum (pmax) and time of absolute maximum change (tmax)):\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_maxtyp_DoE_Predictions: for each simulation and each gauge_nr, the maxtyp of the HRV over the prediction period (2012 to 2102)\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_DoE_Observations: for each simulation and each gauge_nr, the HRV for the years that observations are available\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_Observations: summary statistics of each HRV and the observed value (based on data set CLM16swg Surface water gauging station data within the Clarence Moreton Basin)\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_maxtyp_Predictions: summary statistics of each HRV\n\n\n\nR-script CLM_CreateObjectiveFunction.R calculates for each HRV the objective function value for all simulations and stores it in CLM_AWRA_HRV_ss.csv. This file is used by python script CLM_AWRA_SI.py to generate figure CLM-2615-002-SI.png (sensitivity indices).\n\n\n\nThe AWRA objective function is combined with the overall objective function from the groundwater model in dataset CLM Modflow Uncertainty Analysis (CLM_MF_DoE_ObjFun.csv) into csv file CLM_AWRA_HRV_oo.csv. This file is used to select behavioural simulations in python script CLM-2615-001-top10.py. This script uses files CLM_NodeOrder.csv and BA_Visualisation.py to create the figures CLM-2616-001-HRV_10pct.png.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) CLM AWRA HRVs Uncertainty Analysis.

    "title": "IMOS - SRS Satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) sub-facility",
    "description": "As part of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the Australian Bureau of Meteorology produce high-resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products over the Australian region, designed to suit a range of operational and research applications.  All these products follow the latest International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST: www.ghrsst.org) file formats, assisting international data exchange and collaboration.\nThe highest spatial resolution (1 km x 1 km) data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors on NOAA polar-orbiting satellites can only be obtained through receiving direct broadcast “HRPT” data from the satellite.  In Australia, HRPT data is received by a number of agencies (Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia, AIMS and CSIRO) and consortia (WASTAC and TERSS) at ground-stations located in Darwin, Townsville, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth and Alice Springs and in Antarctica at Casey and Davis Stations.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology, in collaboration with CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, is combining raw data from the various ground-stations and producing real-time HRPT AVHRR skin (~ 10 micron depth) SST data files in the GHRSST GDS v2.0 L2P (single swath, geolocated), L3U (single swath, gridded), one and three day daytime/night-time L3C (single sensor, multiple swath, gridded) and one, three and six day daytime/night-time L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swath, gridded) formats.  The L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files for NOAA-15, 17, 18 and 19 satellite data are available through the IMOS FTP server (ftp://aodaac2-cbr.act.csiro.au/imos/GHRSST), IMOS AO-DAAC (http://www.marine.csiro.au/remotesensing/imos/aggregator.html# ) and IMOS Ocean Portal (http://imos.aodn.org.au/webportal/), and will eventually be available through the GHRSST Global Data Assembly Centre (http://ghrsst.jpl.nasa.gov).  Archived raw HRPT AVHRR data from Australian and Antarctic ground-stations back to 1992 will be progressively reprocessed into skin SST L2P, L3U, L3C and L3S files and be available to GHRSST and IMOS by June 2013.\nFor the user, there are several advantages to using GHRSST-format SST products.  For each SST value the GHRSST files contain a quality level flag (based on proximity to cloud, satellite zenith angle and day/night) and bias and standard deviation error estimates based on 60 day match-ups with drifting buoy SST data.  Note that the closer an SST pixel is to cloud, the higher the standard deviation.  Therefore, the presence of these quality level flags and error information enable users to tailor the L2P, L3U, L3C or L3S files for their particular research application by trading SST spatial coverage for accuracy and vice versa.  Users have the ability to access L3U, L3C and L3S SST products through IMOS OPeNDAP servers, greatly simplifying data access and extraction.  Providing real-time HRPT AVHRR SST files in GHRSST-L2P format enables them to be incorporated into global and regional, gap-free, analyses of L2P SST from multiple satellites such as NASA’s G1SST global 1 km daily SST analysis and the Bureau of Meteorology’s daily regional and global SST analyses (RAMSSA and GAMSSA).\nThe new IMOS AVHRR L2P SSTs exhibit approximately 75% the error of the Bureau’s pre-existing HRPT AVHRR level 2 SST data, with standard deviations compared with drifting buoys during night-time of around 0.3°C and during daytime of around 0.4°C for quality level 5 (highest). This significant improvement in accuracy has been achieved by improving cloud clearing and calibration - using regional rather than global drifting buoy SST observations and incorporating a dependence on latitude.\nFor further details on the AVHRR GHRSST products see Paltoglou et al. (2010) (http://imos.org.au/srsdoc.html).  Enquiries can be directed to Helen Beggs (h.beggs(at)bom.gov.au).\n\n\nAll the IMOS satellite SST products are supplied in GHRSST netCDF format and are either geolocated swath (\"L2P\") files or level 3 composite, gridded files that will have gaps where there were no observations during the specified time period.  The various L3U (single swath), L3C (single sensor, multiple swath) and L3S (multiple sensors, multiple swaths) are designed to suit different applications.  Some current applications of the various IMOS satellite SST products are:\n\nHRPT AVHRR data:\n\nL2P: Ingestion into optimally interpolated SST analysis systems (eg. RAMSSA, GAMSSA, G1SST, ODYSSEA);\n\nL3U: Calculation of surface ocean currents (IMOS OceanCurrents);\n\nL3C: Estimation of diurnal warming of the surface ocean (GHRSST Tropical Warm Pool Diurnal Variation (TWP+) Project);\n\nL3S: Estimation of likelihood of coral bleaching events (ReefTemp II).\n\nL3P: Legacy 14-day Mosaic AVHRR SST which is a weighted mean SST produced daily from multiple NOAA satellites in a cut-down GHRSST netCDF format.  This product is still used in a coral bleaching prediction system run at CMAR.  The product is produced using the legacy BoM processing system and is less accurate than the new IMOS L3S product.\n\nGeostationary satellite MTSAT-1R data:\n\nL3U: Hourly, 0.05 deg x 0.05 deg SST used for estimation of the diurnal warming of the surface ocean and validation of diurnal warming models (TWP+ Project).",

    "title": "Tide Gauge Records, Macquarie Island",
    "description": "Tides are recorded at Macquarie Island using two sensors, one an acoustic height measuring system and the other a pressure measuring system. The raw records are stored at AADC.\n      The records are processed by The National Tidal Centre to produce tidal records, predictions and residuals.\n        \n      Documentation dated 2001-06-12\n      The Macquarie Island Tide Gauge System\n      \n      The Macquarie Island Tide Gauge was first commissioned in November 1993. Since then every year attempts have been made to improve the performance of the system.\n      The next improvement involves the installation of radio modems to effect a network link to the tide gauge dataloggers. Other improvements planned are include using the wave guide temperatures to correct the water heights for variations in the velocity of sound in air due to temperature gradients in the waveguide. \n      The system consists of two separate sensors contained in separate housings on a rock shelf on the northern side of Garden Cove. One of the sensors is an Aquatrack acoustic type and the other is a Druck pressure transducer. Both housings contain a Platypus Engineering data logger and a battery. The housings consist each of an Admiralty Bronze ring bolted down to a concrete plinth and a glass fibre reinforced cover held down by a single central bolt and nut. \n      Primary power for both installations comes from a solar panel array mounted on the northern side of the rock ridge behind the rock shelf. The solar panels are attached to an aluminium frame which is bolted to a galvanized steel frame cemented into holes in the rock face. The bolts are made of nylon with nylon washers so that the aluminium frame is not in contact with the galvanized frame.\n      Mounted below the panels is a sealed plastic box with a hinged door. A multicore data cable runs from this box to the tide gauge housings. This cable is run inside a length of plastic conduit along with the power cable. The conduit is concealed in the vegetation and at the lower level is cemented into slots cut into the rock\n      The batteries in the housing are kept charged by the solar panels but are isolated via power diodes, one in each housing. Either or both of the housing batteries or only the solar panel battery may be removed without interruption to data logging. The voltage of either housing battery may be found by interrogation of the appropriate data logger.\n      \n      Tide Gauge Bore Holes.\n      \n      Both gauges obtain access to the ocean via an inclined hole about 12 metres long inclined at approximately 34 and 39 degrees to the horizontal. Both holes are lined with a plastic pipe which is normally not removable. In the Aquatrack sensor hole a 50mm ABS pressure pipe runs down inside the liner and is fitted with a brass strainer and orifice at the lower end. This strainer protrudes into the ocean somewhat clear of the sea floor (see figure). Inside the 50mm pipe runs a 15mm diameter plastic pipe. The bottom end of this is fitted with a 600mm length of red brass tubing and stops about 100mm from the orifice at the bottom of the pipe. The 15mm pipe is held central in the 50mm pipe by three armed spiders placed about every metre down the pipe. The top end of both pipes is secured by a flange with two O rings and stainless steel screws. On top of the 15mm pipe is mounted the Aquatrack acoustic sensor the 15mm pipe acting as a waveguide for sound pulses from the sensor (see figure ). The Aquatrack sensor measures the distance of the water surface from a reference point on the sensor. About one metre down the wave guide is a small hole. This has two functions. One is to act as vent to allow water to rise and fall in the wave guide and the other is to provide an acoustic reflection at a known distance down the wave guide. This allows compensation for velocity of sound changes due to temperature changes.\n      The Aquatrak wave guide has a series of thermistors placed along its length. The bottom one is always submerged and is used to measure the seawater temperature..The top one is placed just below the Sensor and the others evenly spaced along the length of the waveguide. The temperature readings from these can be used to compensate for the change in the velocity of sound due to density changes. This feature has not yet been used.\n      The Druck Sensor has a single thermistor placed beside it which measures seawater temperature.\n      \n      System Components. \n      \n      The Aquatrak Installation houses four main components.\n      1. The Aquatrack Sensor and Waveguide Assembly. The sensor itself is in a waterproof plastic tube with a cable with a waterproof connector which plugs into the Bartek controller.\n      2. The Bartek Controller, housed in a waterproof diecast box with waterproof connectors. This lies in the centre of the installation housing.\n      3. The Platypus Engineering Datalogger \n      4. The Battery, a 15 Ah, 12 volt sealed gel cell lead acid battery. It is charged from the solar a diode. The battery lies in the main housing opposite the Datalogger .\n      \n      The Druck Installation houses four main components\n      1. The Druck Pressure Sensor, fitted to the end of a 13 metre cable, submerged in seawater about 10 metres down the borehole.\n      The cable has five conductors and an air vent enclosed within it.\n      2. The Pressure Sensor Amplifier housed in a waterproof diecast box. This box has a vent leading to a vented bottle filled with silica gel to keep the transducer air vent dry.\n      3. A Datalogger As above.\n      4. A battery as above \n      \n      The Solar Panel Installation has three main parts.\n      1. Three Photo Voltaic Solar Panels, two 60 Watt and one 30 Watt. These are mounted on an aluminium frame attached to a hotdip galvanised steel frame with insulating bolts. \n      2. A sealed plastic box mounted below the panels containing a12V 24 Ah Battery and a regulator and the radio modem equipment. (The modems are not currently fitted.)\n      3. Antennae and cables protected with flexible conduit.\n      Data Retrieval\n      \n      Data have been retrieved at approximately 30 day intervals from the Garden Cove gauges by using a portable computer to download the data loggers. The connector for this is in the enclosure by the solar panels allowing the loggers to be accessed during bad weather.\n      \n      Documentation dated 2008-10-17\n      1. In April 2007, the dataloggers and radio modems at Macquarie Island Tide Gauge site were replaced with Campbell Scientific CR1000 dataloggers.\n      2. This change enabled data to be streamed from the pressure sensor datalogger every 30 seconds.\n      3. There has been no change to scaling of records from the Aquatrak sensor as generation of ranges is done by the Aquatrak controller, the datalogger only saving and transmitting the records.\n       Records from the pressure sensor however are now not converted to heights but saved and streamed as raw A/D conversion values.\n       It is intended that appropriate scales and offsets for this sensor be derived after a Floating GPS Buoy exercise.\n      4. Data is streamed from the pressure sensor logger as this is the only sensor that can be supply 30 seconds average values.\n          This logger also streams 3 minute average values.\n      5. The aquatrak sensor logger streams 3 minute average value ranges.\n      6. Data is streamed in NVP (name/Value Pair) format as defined by BoM.\n      7. Embedded in the streams are battery voltage and aquatrak waveguide temperature values.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. The metadata was not provided by the data supplier and has been compiled by the programme based on known details.\n\n\n\nThis dataset was created for the Galilee subregion by performing the Tasselled Cap Index on Landsat data using Digital Earth Australia (DEA) to create a wetness summary image. This wetness summary image identifies open water or wet vegetation presence in pixel by proportion of images in which pixel exceeded tasselled cap wetness threshold over 30 year archive.\n\n\n\nDEA is an analysis platform for satellite imagery and other Earth observations. Today, it translates 30 years of Earth observation data (taken every two weeks at 25 metre squared resolution) and tracks changes across Australia in unprecedented detail, identifying soil and coastal erosion, crop growth, water quality, and changes to cities and regions.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe tasselled cap wetness in the landscape summary output is produced using DEA. Landsat surface reflectance data at 25 m resolution with information in the red, green, blue, near infra-red and short-wave infra-red spectral bands are retrieved from the DEA archive using a spatial query for Galilee subregion. Clouds and areas of terrain shadow are masked from the surface reflectance data. A tasselled cap transformation is performed on each of the surface reflectance bands to produce a per-pixel 'wetness' value. This method is based on the tasselled cap transformation of Crist EP (1985) A TM tasselled cap equivalent transformation for reflectance factor data. Remote Sensing of Environment 17(3), 301-306, but only uses the component of transformed surface reflectance in the 'wetness' direction to identify the presence of water and wet vegetation.\n\nAreas of water and wet vegetation are highlighted where pixels exceed a specified wetness threshold. Pixels exceeding the wetness threshold are counted through the temporal image archive. This count is then normalised by the number of times that the pixel was observed (cloud free). The wetness in the landscape summary is then presented as the percentage of scenes where the pixel has contained water or wet vegetation through time. Selecting a spatial transect of interest (e.g. a line that follows a river, or crosses a wetland or spring) allows for retrieval of the wetness threshold data for each image pixel along the transect line.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2017) Galilee normed TCI landsat and traverses.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nVegetation cover condition is an assessment of how much impact disturbances (including management activities) have had on ground cover. Condition is assessed using Compere, a relative performance bench marking framework that compares one location's value to the values of all biophysically equivalent locations in a given region. Resulting condition estimates range from 0 (lowest observed cover among equivalents) to 1 (highest observed). Underlying total vegetation cover data are the total fraction of ground covered by green and senesced plant material (Guerschman et al., 2018, Remote Sensing of Environment 113, 928-945). Cover condition has been assessed yearly from 2001 to 2018 at a grid resolution of 500 m.  \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nAnnual rainfall, historical NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), slope and total cover fraction data were used to calculate cover condition.  Annual rainfall was from the Bureau of Meteorology daily 5 km gridded data (Jeffrey et al., 2001).  NDVI was from MODIS MOD13Q1 and MOD09Q1 data.  Slope was from the CSIRO’s SRTM 9 digital elevation model data (Gallant et al., 2011).  Cover was from CSIRO’s fractional cover data (derived from MCD43A4 data, Guerschman and Hill, 2018).\r\nSurface Water Points data and the Sturt National Park boundary data were used to test results.  These were sourced from Crossman and Li (2015) and Commonwealth of Australia (2019), respectively.\r\nBackground NDVI, slope and annual rainfall were used quantify locations that were biophysically equivalent to a given target location.  The total cover fraction of the target was compared to that from all ‘equivalent’ locations to yield a relative ranking of the target’s cover value.  This is interpreted directly as cover condition.  This was repeated for all locations (grid cells) and years.\r\nAn assessment of the impact of the mining industry on cover condition across the Cooper region was undertaken, using confidential well location data. \r\nSee associated publications for more details.\r\nJones, D.A., Wang, W., & Fawcett, R.

    "description": "The current distribution of Adelie penguin breeding colonies in the AAT is being mapped through a series of 'occupancy' surveys.\n\nA GIS of potential Adelie penguin breeding habitat was developed by David Smith and Angela Bender from the AADC to structure the overall search effort. Potential Adelie penguin breeding habitat was defined as islands or ice-free land close to the ocean. The GIS spanned across longitudes 36.98 to 158.82 and included 4917 sites of potential breeding habitat (see file 'Sites'). Each site of potential breeding habitat has been given an identifying code and a centroid location with an associated latitude and longitude. More information on the GIS is given in Southwell et al. (2009).\n\nThe AAT coastline was broken into groups and subgroups which were surveyed when logistics allowed. For information about the surveys see the metadata record 'Occupancy surveys of Adelie penguin breeding distribution in the Australian Antarctic Territory' with Entry ID: ASAC_2722_Occupancy_Surveys and the associated child metadata records.\n\nMaps of potential breeding habitat in the groups and subgroups were produced by Angela Bender from the GIS to use in the field surveys.\n\nThe download files include:\n1 Shapefiles created for this study: one representing islands and ice-free continental land and other with the subgroup boundaries.

    "description": "Data layers provided by the LGA and the information within are only valid at the time of production. The habitat layer provided by the LGA may vary in spatial coverage of vegetation based on the date of production and the latest imagery used to determine current vegetation presence. \nPotential clearing of vegetation based on landuse zoning is only indicative as variable outcomes of vegetation clearance based on the landuse zoning can occur.\nKoala Corridor mapping is only indicative as koalas do not traverse the landscape in a linear direction, although they will seek favoured trees.\nKoala occupancy mapping is only indicative as records rely on recording koalas in the landscape, records are driven by human activity.\nNot all areas were assessed, only areas that have the potential to be developed and therefore the potential to impact koala habitat. \nThis research has been funded by the NSW Koala Research Plan under the NSW Koala Strategy. The NSW Koala Research Plan sets out a targeted and coordinated way for us to increase our knowledge of koalas. It is a 10-year plan that will be regularly reviewed and updated throughout its life.\nFind out more about the Koala Research Plan: https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/programs-legislation-and-framework/nsw-koala-strategy/nsw-koala-research-plan\n__Find more datasets: __ https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/group/about/nsw-koala-research-plan",

    "description": "This dataset contains cycling volume, movement flow and demographic data for the 'Super Tuesday' Commuter Bike Count event over the years 2010 to 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were visually undertaken by volunteers. The data covers the following Local Government Areas (LGAs):\n\n\nAlice Springs\n\n\nBoroondara\n\n\nBrimbank\n\n\nKatherine\n\n\nMelbourne\n\n\nMonash\n\n\nMoonee Valley\n\n\nMoreland\n\n\nPalmerston\n\n\nTennant Creek\n\n\nWhitehorse\n\n\nYarra\n\n\nThe 'Super Tuesday' counters collect data from intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. Bicycle Network coordinates the count at locations nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. The counts were conducted by volunteer counters who record all movements, gender of riders and their observations in fifteen minute time intervals on standardised count sheets.\nBicycle Network's 'Super Counts' programs count the volumes of bicycles and other active travellers, and their movements on roads and paths. The Super Counts program comprises two counting events: 'Super Tuesday' commuter count and the 'Super Sunday' recreation count. Super Tuesday is a two-hour count conducted during a Tuesday morning peak period in March (7-9am); Super Sunday is a four-hour count conducted during a Sunday morning-afternoon period in November (9-1pm).\nFor more information please visit Bicycle Network Bike Counts.\nBicycle counts help track progress, and identify areas of improvement to inform active transport policy with the goal of making it easier for more people to choose active modes everyday. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nAURIN has converted dates to ISO 8601 format, and have spatially enabled this dataset by creating geometries from the latitude and longitude columns with PostGIS.",

    "description": "The Larsemann Hills region is dominated by two major lithological associations, a Palaeoproterozoic felsic/mafic orthogneiss complex (S&oslash;strene Orthogneiss) which occurs as basement to a sequence of pelitic, psammitic and felsic paragneiss (supergroup = Brattstrand Paragneiss) and felsic intrusives. The depositional age of the Brattstrand Paragneiss sequences are controversial but isotopic data suggest derivation from the basement S&oslash;strene Orthogneiss. Current geochronology indicates that the region experienced medium to low pressure granulite-facies metamorphism during the Early Palaeozoic (~500 Ma). Although the paragneiss sequences record no evidence of earlier metamorphism, relicts of a previous metamorphic event at ~1000 Ma are preserved in the S&oslash;strene Orthogneiss. Within the Larsemann Hills region, the Early Palaeozoic event is characterised by peak metamorphism of ~7 kbar at ~800-850 degrees C, with the post-peak evolution characterised by decompression, with some cooling, to 4 kbars at 750 degrees C, then to 2-3 kbar at 600-650 degrees C during final stages of orogenesis, with exhumation largely driven by crustal extension. Tectonic models generally argue for a continental-continental collisional scenario, with thermal input derived from a thinned mantle lithosphere.\r\n\r\nSee the document available for download at the URL given below for further information.",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were already in very good condition at the end of winter. \r\n• Rainfall in September was well above average in most regions in the eastern states (including South Australia). This resulted in plentiful supplies of soil moisture being available to crops during the critical period for grain development. However, in some areas, particularly in New South Wales, the September rainfall resulted in flooding and waterlogged crops, which adversely affected grain development. \r\n• In Western Australia, spring rainfall was average to slightly below average--but timely--and aided grain development. However, severe frosts adversely affected grain development in some growing regions. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes with higher production forecast for every state. This represents a 14 per cent upward revision from the forecast ABARES published in the September 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n• For the major winter crops: wheat production is forecast to rise by 35 per cent to a record high of 32.6 million tonnes; barley production is forecast to rise by 24 per cent to a record high of 10.6 million tonnes; and canola production is forecast to rise by 22 per cent to 3.6 million tonnes, which would be the third-highest on record. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology indicated in its latest three-month rainfall outlook (December 2016 to February 2017), issued on 24 November 2016, that summer was likely to be drier and warmer than average. This should aid harvesting. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n• Australian cotton production is forecast to increase by 64 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.0 million tonnes of cotton lint and around 1.5 million tonnes of cottonseed. This forecast largely reflects increased planted area, which is estimated to have almost doubled to 520 000 hectares. \r\n• Area planted to grain sorghum is forecast to fall by 31 per cent in 2016-17 to 471 000 hectares, the lowest in 24 years. This reflects higher expected returns from growing cotton. Grain sorghum production is forecast to fall by 29 per cent to 1.4 million tonnes. \r\n• Area planted to rice is forecast to increase almost fourfold in 2016-17 to 90 000 hectares in response to an increase in the supply of irrigation water available to rice growers. However, area planted to rice is expected to be constrained by the later than usual winter crop harvest in southern New South Wales. Rice production is forecast to rise to 916 000 tonnes, an increase of more than three times on the previous season. \r\n",

    "description": "NSW Private Land Conservation Agreements (NSW PLC Agreements) is an authoritative dataset that brings together all private protected areas administered by the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Trust (BCT). It replaces a previous dataset known as ‘BCT Agreements’ which was first released by the BCT in 2019.\nNSW PLC Agreements organises private protected areas into a single layer with geometric overlaps between different agreement types. The dataset spatially represents the boundaries of agreements made under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and preceding legislation. Individual Deeds of Agreement should be consulted for specific information about the extent of the subject land and legal obligations of the land owner.\nAgreements entered into under the BC Act are registered on the land title, binding current and successive landowners. Agreements established under preceding legislation may not be registered on title. \nThree agreement types are represented in the dataset (1) Biodiversity Stewardship Agreements (BSA) (formerly BioBanking agreements), (2) Conservation Agreements (CA), and (3) Wildlife Refuge Agreements (WRA). \nThe dataset is for internal use only, and is not for public distribution or display.",

    "title": "Catchment scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017",
    "description": "This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the first national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at September 2017. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). It complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 dataset (ABARES 2017). Agricultural commodities are assigned to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8 (ABARES 2016) classes based on; perceived intervention to the landscape, growing conditions and management, the intended use of the commodity, consistency with national and international reporting frameworks and standards, such as National Plantation Inventory, industry guidelines, Australian Bureau of Statistics, harmonised trade codes and ABARES commodity reports, where possible. \r\n\r\nCommodities data were produced as part of catchment scale land use mapping and primarily uses fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field (ABARES 2011, 2015). Field validation was critical for mapping commodities. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nJurisdictions captured commodity data (where possible) for those areas most recently mapped in the Catchment scale land use of Australia - Update September 2017 (ABARES 2017) with a focus on horticultural and intensive animal industries. Other commodities which are tertiary classes of the ALUM classification (such as sugar cane, cotton, rice, olives and grapes) have been mapped by jurisdictions for some time and are included in this dataset. Agricultural commodity level mapping is available for all of the Northern Territory, and is likely to be complete for the following commodities nationally: \r\n\r\n* Crops - rice, sugar cane, cotton\r\n* Fruit - bananas (except Southern Queensland), avocados, mangoes, olives, grapes\r\n* Nuts - macadamias\r\n* Livestock - dairy cattle, pigs, poultry, horse studs, aquaculture.\r\n\r\nCommodity information is selected from an agreed list of commodity names developed by ACLUMP partners. A commodity may be applied to one or many land use codes. For example the commodity 'wheat' is applied to class 3.3.1, 'Cropping' or 4.4.1, 'Irrigated cropping', while 'cattle' may be applied to any land use where cattle are observed including 2.1.0 'Grazing native vegetation', 3.2.0 'Grazing modified pastures', 4.2.0 'Grazing irrigated modified pastures', 5.2.2 'Feedlots' etc. \r\n\r\nThe commodity description is intended to add information to the catchment scale land use map which is not otherwise recorded in the ALUM Classification. Where there are several suitable commodity descriptions mappers are encouraged to record the most detailed description. For example when cattle breeds are known to be for milk production mappers would apply the commodity description 'cattle dairy' rather than just 'cattle'.\r\n",

The processes undertaken to produce this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset is an updated version of the Galilee groundwater data October 2016.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nData from the following source datasheets within the QLD groundwater database were used: Registrations, Casing, Aquifer, Stratigraphy, Pump test and water levels. \n\nRelevant data was extracted from these source datasheets and compiled in new tab called  \"SWL Interp\".  Then the hydrostratigraphic interpretation from the original data compilation was incorporated into the \"SWL interp\" datasheet in the column called BA \"strat\". These interpretations are tagged in the \"strat interp source\" column as \"July14 SWL\" . For completeness the original interpretation is included in the datasheet called \"July14SWL\"\n\n\n\nThe focus of these updated interpretation were bores that may be screened in aquifers in the Galilee Basin. Bores that were interpreted utilising the updated data are tagged in the \"strat interp source\" column as \"Mar17 interp\".

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Effective environmental impact assessment (EIA) relies on rigorous scientific assessment of all potential causal pathways by which large-scale developments may impact on valued assets in a region. Despite their importance to decision-making, many EIAs are flawed by incomplete analysis of causal pathways, limited spatial assessment and a lack of transparency about how risks have been evaluated across the region. To address these, we developed an EIA methodology based on network analysis of potential causal pathways in a given region. This network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very 21 high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the Beetaloo region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset has the input spreadsheet describing the nodes and links in the Beetaloo causal network (BEE_input.xlsx) and the spreadsheet summarizing the results of the spatial causal network analysis (BEE_output.xlsx). The dataset also contains all the grids associated with the link evaluations (grids/input) as geotiff files. The filename corresponds to the entries in the gridname column in the input spreadsheet. The dataset also contains the output grids as geotiff files. These are stored in the directory grids/outputs, organised in a directory per endpoint. Each of these directories contains: 1. a png file of the subnetwork of links leading to that endpoint, 2. the overall impact grid (geotiff), 3. a heatmap of number of processes of concern for each endpoint (geotiff) and three subdirectories (activity, stressor, process) of the impact grids of the causal pathways that contain the activity, stressor or process.",
