    "description": "This study examined differences in the size and shape of Siphonaria diemenensis in the high and low intertidal zones on a rocky shore in Western Port Bay, Victoria. The tenacities of individual limpets and wave action in the 2 zones were also measured. All fieldwork was conducted at Griffith Point, San Remo between April and October 1987. \n\nIt was found that limpets in the high shore were significantly taller and narrower than limpets in the low shore. For a given length, the tenacity at which the limpets adhered to the substrate was greater in the low zone compared to the high zone. Wave velocities were generally greater in the low zone which could explain the differences in size and shape and tenacity between the zones. However, a laboratory study demonstrated that the tenacities of limpets were much greater than the drag forces exerted on them by wave action. This study suggests that the differences between the high and low zone limpet populations can not be explained by wave action. Alternative explanations could be related to food availability, life-history patterns and desiccation.\n\nThe data collected from each component of this study are described in the related records.",

    "description": "The prevalence of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in and around the Galactic center and the bulge has been one of the key questions in pulsar astronomy. In addition to finding more exotic and interesting binary systems at and around the Galactic center and bulge due to the enhanced density of stars/stellar remnants, MSPs are also proposed to be one of the candidates to explain the observed Fermi gamma-ray excess. However, most of the MSPs discovered so far are field (disk) MSPs or those in globular clusters. Initial steps towards addressing the question of Galactic center/bulge MSPs were made with the discovery of the first MSPs in a Galactic filament, but more progress comes from the discovery of a sample of MSPs around the Galactic center. Blind surveys targeting MSPs can suffer from many observational biases that smear the pulses due to binary acceleration, scattering from the enhanced density, and so on, which increases the parameter space for discovery and can sometimes make the problem intractable. However, if pulsar candidates can be identified reliably from imaging surveys, then targeted observations can make the problem tractable in identifying the pulsations. We followed up a sample of polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT bulge imaging survey and discovered a sample of 16 new MSPs. Here we request the timing observations of 8 interesting MSPs (a subset of our discovery sample), to study the binary nature of these sources and their potential inclusion in pulsar timing array efforts.",

    "title": "Significance of Halimeda bioherms to the global carbonate budget based on a geological sediment budget for the Northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia",
    "description": "Since the correlation between carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures was established in the ice core records, quantifying the components of the global carbon cycle has become a priority with a view to constraining models of the climate system. The link between the marine carbonate budget and atmospheric CO2 levels draws attention to the fact that this budget is still not adequately quantified. \n\nIt is widely accepted that the calcareous green alga Halimeda is a prominent contributor of carbonate to reef sediment facies in the tropics, however, Halimeda bioherms remain one of the main reservoirs of unaccounted for carbonate. In fact, it has been suggested that Halimeda bioherms on the shelf of the Northern Great Barrier Reef may contain an equal or greater volume of carbonate than the reefs themselves.\n\nHere we attempt to determine the quantitative relationship between Halimeda bioherm and coral reef derived carbonate accumulated during the Holocene on the outer shelf of the Northern Great Barrier Reef Province using data from seismic profiles, reef drill cores and Halimeda bioherm piston and vibrocore cores from the published literature. \n\nThe methodology used is detailed in the document availble for download through this record.\n\nCalculations reveal that the ribbon reefs of the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions cover areas of approximately 18.5 and 20.5 km2 and comprise approximately 0.52 and 0.92 Gt CaCO3 respectively. The Halimeda bioherms of the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions cover areas of approximately 184 and 118 km2 and comprise approximately 2.06 and 0.86 Gt CaCO3 respectively. \n\nThus, that ratio of ribbon reef to Halimeda bioherm CaCO3 is approximately 1:4 and 1:1 for the Lizard Island and Cooktown regions respectively. If we assume that the carbonate content of the Lizard Island region bioherms ranges from 20 to 90 %, we estimate that the mass balance of Halimeda bioherm CaCO3 is between 0.55 and 2.5 Gt. The ratio of ribbon reef to Halimeda bioherms CaCO3 may vary between 1:1 to 1:5 depending on the carbonate content of the Lizard Island bioherms.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2006 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "The 2022 APS Employee Census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees, running from 9 May to 10 June 2022. \r\n\r\nThe Employee Census provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The Census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, employee wellbeing, and job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOverall, 120,662 APS employees responded to the Employee Census in 2022, a response rate of 83%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200MB in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n__TECHNICAL NOTES__ \r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2022 APS Employee Census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2022 APS Employee Census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2022 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2022 APS Employee Census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2022 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2022 APS Employee Census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2022 APS Employee Census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2022 APS Employee Census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.\r\n",

Details of foreign ownership of residential land have been collected since 1 July 2016 and provide insight into trends over time but do not provide a complete stocktake. For assets introduced at the commencement of the Register (commercial land, business interests and mining or production tenements and exploration tenements), information is only provided for the 12 months to 30 June 2024.\r\n\r\nData relating to residential land is updated periodically by the ATO to reflect registrations that may be added or removed by the Registrar as a result of third-party data matching.\r\n\r\nFor further information on the Register of Foreign Ownership of Australian Asset see: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Foreign-investment-in-Australia/Register-of-Foreign-Ownership-of-Australian-Assets/",

The mapping was carried out by using a grid marked out with improvised survey pegs at intervals of 100' along magnetic bearings N-S and E-W. The average error in this grid was quite small. The datum for the grid was chosen to coincide with that of the base line of the Coronation Hill plane table survey. Contours are based on levels obtained by aneroid barometer.",

Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

    "description": "This table: NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_DETAIL is a lookup table containing NVIS Version 5.1 vegetation descriptions. The table contains a total of 10,774 NVIS vegetation types. \n\nThis table joins to the NVIS 5.1 spatial data for all states and territories (NVIS_ID in this table to NVISDSC1 in NVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_ and NVIS5_1_AUST_PRE_ ). For complex analyses and to extract maximum information from NVIS spatial data, this LUT can also be linked to NVISDSC2-6. \n\nIt is recommended that users refer to the Australian Vegetation Atrribute Manual V7.0 for understanding of the NVIS hierarchy (Level 1-6 descriptions) - \nhttp://www.environment.gov.au/node/18927. \n\nOnce this table has been joined, a simple display option is to use the field \"NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_DETAIL.MVG_NAME\" (or MVS_NAME if preferred) which includes the names of the NVIS Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs) [most of] which are described at: http://www.environment.gov.au/land/publications/factsheets-vegetation-profiles-major-vegetation-groups. \n\nA legend or 'shadeset' for the MVGs and MVSs can be found packaged with the detailed vector data: NVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_ and NVIS5_1_AUST_PRE_.\n\nUse the field \"MVG_NUMBER\" or \"MVS_NUMBER\" for the symbology.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.\n\nUsers should recognise that Levels 1 to 4 of the NVIS Hierarchy were generated automatically and are not always satisfactory for analyses. Also, Levels 5 and 6 are sometimes incomplete for a given region - i.e. spatial and/or attribute \"gaps\" exist in the data. \n\nTo avoid these problems and ensure the data can be used for continental and regional analyses, the MVG and MVS classifications and products were developed with additional manual interpretation and additional non-NVIS data interpreted direct to MVG/MVS.\n\nThis version was based on new NVIS data from Tasmania and further gapfill work completed for NSW. Collection scale, more-detailed vegetation floristic and structural data and/or more-consistent interpretations have been improved for many parts of Australia. Therefore, it would not be valid to compare this version quantitatively with earlier version(s) of NVIS.\n\nNon-vegetation and non-native vegetation major vegetation classes are not to be used in quantitative analyses.\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018",

This data relates to plant fitness and could be used for more broader studies in this area. We established a common garden experiment within a 238 ha restoration site owned and managed by the South Australian Water Corporation (SA Water), near the township of Clarendon (-35.0882°S, 138.6236°E). We grew ca.1500 seedlings sourced from one local and two non-local provenances of <i>Eucalyptus leucoxylon</i> to test whether local provenancing was appropriate. The three provenances spanned an aridity gradient, with the local provenance sourced from the most mesic area and the distant provenance sourced from the most arid. We explored the effect of provenance on four fitness proxies after 15 months, including survival, above-ground height, susceptibility to insect herbivory, and pathogen related stress.",

    "description": "This data was collected from May to June 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2012_V02.\n\nDeparted: \tLautoka, Fiji, May 11, 2012\nArrived:   \tLautoka, Fiji, June 04, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2013, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (DCM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data is normally collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses, but not on this cruise\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nGroundwater samples were obtained from the Cooper Basin, Eromanga Basin and Lake Eyre Basin as part of Stage 3 of the Cooper GBA project. The Eromanga Basin is a part of the Great Artesian Basin. Evans et al. (2020) and Holland et al. (2020) provide detail on hydrogeology of the Cooper GBA region.  In total 39 samples were collected from a range of hydrogeological settings in two field campaigns. One field campaign focussed on obtaining groundwater samples from bores drawing groundwater from Eromanga Basin and overlying Lake Eyre Basin (LBWCo (2020), Dataset 1). Reservoir water samples were collected by petroleum companies on behalf of the GBA program (Dataset 2). Where possible the samples were clustered to provide hydrochemical information at various depths. The locations of bores that were sampled are outlined in Figure 3.  The sample dataset (Dataset 3, and Dataset 4) is comprised of: – Sixteen from shallow sub-artesian aquifers either the Winton Formation or the Cenozoic Lake Eyre Basin (bores less than 100 m deep). – Thirteen deep GAB bores (sample depths from 1100 to 2070 m).  – Ten samples from petroleum wells producing from deep hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Cooper and Eromanga basins.  Hydrochemical analyses include: field parameters, major and minor ions, hydrocarbons, as well as environmental groundwater tracers. Environmental groundwater tracers include; Strontium isotopes, noble gases including 4He, stable isotopes of water, stable isotopes of hydrogen and carbon from methane, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), as well as radioactive tracers - tritium (3H),  Carbon 14 (14C) and Chloride 36 (36Cl).  Further infromation can be found in the fact sheet 10 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba. \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSampling of aquifers in Eromanga Basin (GAB) and Lake Eyre Basin (Cenozoic) was undertaken by a contractor (LBWCO Pty Ltd) in October 2020. CSIRO sampled 6 GAB bores in November 2019. Samples from production wells were collected by companies on behalf of GBA.",

    "description": "\n<strong>Overview</strong>\nPCTs are spatial polygons that define the type and extent of known vegetation communities within the ACT <code>pctCode</code> . PCTs have been further stratified into 'zones'&nbsp;<code>pctZone</code>, which reflect the ecological condition of PCTs relative to benchmark thresholds. The ecological condition of a vegetation community, or a&nbsp;'zone' <code>pctZone</code>, is assessed using the attributes that define Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and the ACT Nature Conservation Act 2014 (NC Act). Condition zones can be used to identify sites of high quality for conservation protection (e.g. nature reserve) and candidate sites for offsetting. PCTs can also be used to interrogate the spatial distribution and condition of all mapped vegetation areas across the ACT, and are employed as stocktake, planning and on-ground management units to inform the delivery of conservation, restoration and land development programs.\n<strong>ACT plant community types</strong>\nNaturally occurring native plant community types in the ACT are drawn from Sharp (2007), as implemented in the ACT Vegetation Database (2015), and Armstrong (2013). Each community type is identified by a number, e.g., ACT01, ACT25, known as native vegetation codes (<code>pctCode</code>). Non-naturally occurring plant communities such as exotic plantations and native plantings have been assigned numbers not present in Sharp (2007), e.g., ACT65, ACT66, ACT 99. Vegetation communities from Armstrong have been assigned an ACT prefix, while retaining the Armstrong numbering, e.g., ACT152 = u152, ACT118 = u118. Refer to Appendix A for the current list of plant communities in the ACT.\n<strong>Determining pre-1750 plant community type</strong>\nPCTs reflect the most likely plant community found prior to European colonisation, except for where they are plantings or plantations. Disturbances caused by agricultural practices and abandonment of land practices can obscure the pre-colonised state. The determination of the most likely pre-European plant community found at a present-day site is informed by signs such as the presence and type of native species; the growth form and density of remnant canopy trees; the presence of stags or stumps; the presence and species of midstorey shrubs and trees; the floristic composition of the groundstorey; landscape position and other geographical features such as elevation, aspect, soils, apparent hydrology etc.\n<strong>Mapping PCTs and ecological condition zones</strong>\nThe boundaries of each PCT at a site are accurately mapped on-ground by walking the boundaries and recording them using hand-held GPS and marking directly on to high resolution orthorectified aerial photograph field maps. Once PCTs are mapped, a further assessment of condition is undertaken by dividing a PCT into homogenous&nbsp;'zones'&nbsp;<code>pctZone</code> based on the structure (presence or absence of mature canopy and regeneration), floristic composition (ground story dominance and forb diversity) and overall quality&nbsp;('intactness') of the vegetation. A simple matrix based on the criteria for conservation protection under the EPBC or NC Acts is used to categorise the condition of PCTs of grasslands (Table 1) and woodlands (Table 2 and 3). Although initially used to identify TECs for protection and/or offsetting, PCT zoning has been extended to other plant communities in the ACT and is considered a general measure of condition. There are currently 32 recognised ACT PCTs. To date, not all have been spatially mapped, with efforts focused on TECs facing higher threats at lower elevations, which are more likely to meet EPBC and NC Act status.\nGrasslands and woodland/forest PCTs are assessed using different zone criteria. Note: The <strong>zone classifications are based on threatened grassland and lowland woodland community structural and floristic condition and may therefore not reflect non-threatened communities as accurately.&nbsp;</strong>Two components are used to assess the condition of grasslands: ground layer nativeness and forbs; whereas woodlands have four components, due to the additional components of mature trees and regeneration of tree species. The highest condition scores end in the numeral one (e.g. PCT 1.1 or PCT 16.1.1). Table 4 contains a worked example to interpret condition zones for Box-Gum Grassy Woodlands. Note that the highest condition zone does not represent a pristine environment, but one that meets baseline listing criteria.\nPlease also see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e6f060330ca14473a1d6f9454a500bea\">ACT PCT Code</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6250864b1d7242ca90ecfccc9065e170\">Zone Lookup</a>&nbsp;Tables\n<strong>Woodland zone matrix</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Woodland</strong>\nMature Trees +\nMature Tree –\nRegen +\nRegen –\nRegen +\nRegen –\nNative Cover+\nForb Div. +\n16.1.1*\n16.1.3*\n16.2.1*\n16.2.3*\nForb Div. –\n16.1.2*\n16.1.4*\n16.2.2*\n16.2.4\nNative Cover–\nForb Div. +\n16.3.1'\n16.3.3'\n16.4.1\n16.4.3\nForb Div. –\n16.3.2'\n16.3.4'\n16.4.2\n16.4.4\n<strong>Grassland zone matrix</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Grassland</strong>\nGroundstory Dominance\nNative Forb Diversity\nPCT Zone\nEPBC of NC Act definition\nNative Cover+\nForb Div. ++ (High - Very High)\n1.1\nEPBC, NC\nForb Div. + (Mod - High)\n1.2\nEPBC\nNative Cover &gt;50% Themeda, Poa OR Carex\n1.2\nEPBC\nForb Div. – (Low)\n1.3\n&nbsp;\nNative Cover–\nForb Div. + (Mod)\n1.4\n&nbsp;\nForb Div. – (Low)\n1.4&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nTable 1 Vegetation zone designations for grassland communities&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Groundstorey dominance</strong>\n<strong>Native Forb Diversity</strong>\n<strong>PCT Condition Zone</strong>\n<strong>Type of exotic dominance</strong>\n<strong>EPBC or NC Act</strong>\n<strong>(if relating to PCT01)</strong>\n<strong>Native</strong>\n&nbsp;\nCover of all native understorey plants is greater than the cover of perennial exotics plants\nAt least 12 non-grass native species <strong>OR </strong>At least 3 indicator species <strong>OR</strong> Floristic Value Score more than equal to 6.5\nPCT .1\n_\nEPBC, NC\nFloristic Value Score more than equal to 5 but &lt;

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \n\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\n\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) from small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\n\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\n\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the listed Lowland Rainforest of Subtropical Australia found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n      o Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n• The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n      o Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n\n•\tWhile reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

These polygons were then smoothed to remove boundaries that represent edge of alluvium in minor drainage lines. These smoothed polgons were used to clip the Cooper GBA model grid surfaces of the Cenozioc and Eyre and Glendower Formations. Clipping polygons are required as Eyre and Glendower formations cannot be present where the Winton Formation outcrops.",

    "description": "This record describes collated multibeam and single beam datasets for Heard Island and McDonald Island (HIMI). The dataset was generated for FRDC Project No 2019-169 using a combination of available multibeam (MBES) data (CSIRO RV Investigator), single beam (SBES) data, and existing background bathymetry products. The compiled dataset includes MBES data from RV Investigator voyages IN2016_V01 and IN2020_V01. The SBES data was collected by fishing vessels and the data made available through the FRDC project. Background datasets used include the GEBCO 2022 Grid (GEBCO Compilation Group, 2022) and the AusBathyTopo (Kerguelen Plateau) 100m 2022 - A regional-scale depth model (Beaman, R.J., 2022).\nThe final product is a compiled and interpolated bathymetry surface for HIMI at 200 m resolution (World Mercator projection) in GeoTIFF format. \nNB: Combining datasets from various sources, such as SBES, MBES and satellite derived, will result in artefacts due to the differences in resolution and accuracy of each of these systems.",

    "description": "The Seasonal Ground Cover Summary Statistics datasets provide long-term statistical summaries derived from the seasonal ground cover v3 data, calculated separately for each fraction. Two distinct product types are available, differentiated by their seasonal aggregation and statistical content.\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nSeasonal Statistics per Fraction (Product Code: dpi)For each season and ground cover fraction, a separate raster image is generated for the full time series of available imagery. Each image includes the following statistical layers: include:band 1 &ndash; 5th percentile minimum;band 2 &ndash; mean value for pixel over full time series;band 3 &ndash; median value for pixel over full time series;band 4 &ndash; 95th percentile maximum;band 5 &ndash; Standard deviation - the temporal standard deviation of the full time-series;band 6 &ndash; Count - the number of observations statistics for that pixel are based on.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAll-Seasons Percentile Summary (Product Code: dph)This product summarises the 5th and 95th percentiles across all seasons for each ground cover fraction. It is delivered as a 2-band image, capturing the overall long-term minimum and maximum percentiles across the full time series (currently 1990-2020).\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nVersion 4 update: Dataset filenames have been revised to now include fraction and season tags, replacing multiple stage codes. Related products are grouped under a single code for improved clarity and usability. Additionally, band values are now expressed as percentages (0&ndash;100) to match the parent seasonal ground cover dataset, rather than using the previous percent + 100 scaling.",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Ferry Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2019",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied:\n\n\n\nInstream value assessment developed to support water management activities in NSW is being updated with contemporary datasets. These datasets are integrated into the High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystem (HEVAE) framework, originally developed by the Department of Environment, Commonwealth of Australia. (see: http://www.environment.gov.au/water/publications/aquaticecosystems-\n\ntoolkit-module-3-guidelines-identifying-hevae). The framework incorporates river and/or flow related attributes associated with four of the five recommended HEVAE criteria: Diversity,\n\nDistinctiveness, Naturalness and Vital Habitat. No data is available yet for the fifth criteria, Representativeness. HEVAE assessment is progressively being undertaken for NSW catchments where water planning activities are being undertaken. Attributes associated with each criteria are identified within each catchment of interest, in this case the Hunter Central Rivers. Available data must have spatial\n\ninformation such as coordinates, or polygons that can be intersected by the key stream layer based on River Styles&#xAE; river reaches. This enables river and/or flow related attributes that, could be impacted by extraction, to be associated with river reach spatial layer and enable HEVAE criteria to be displayed in ArcGIS. Depending on the criteria, attributes are weighted according to sensitivity to flow. Some attributes associated with the Distinctiveness criteria are also weighted according to threat status and the certainty or confidence surrounding the occurrence of each record. Scores are determined for each attribute in each criteria and are normalised to provide outcomes that range between 0 -1, where 1 represents the highest possible HEVAE outcomes for each river reach segment. Scores for each HEVAE criteria are combined to provide for a final or overall HEVAE score and assist to identify where priority river reaches occur. This provides a focus for where water sharing rules should be developed to minimise the impact of water extraction on instream values. NOTE: The data used in the Hunter-Central Rivers HEVAE Assessment represents a preliminary HEVAE assessment. Updates will occur to criteria such as Diversity (Fish diversity), Distinctiveness (threatened bird species), and Vital Habitat (Large woody debris and Dissolved Organic Carbon) as the data becomes available.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nProvide a useful framework that indicates the spatial location and importance (priority) of in-stream values to identify risk to in-stream values from extraction. Outputs will guide the development of water\n\naccess and trading rules being developed for NSW water sharing plans.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied:\n\n\n\nTo compile the overall HEVAE outcomes for each river reach in the Hunter-Central Rivers catchment, the following data was compiled for each criteria. Flow sensitivity weightings were applied to all attributes, ranging from 1 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest sensitivity or reliance on river flow. Scores for each attribute and each criteria are normalised to enable scores to be allocated between 1 and 0, where 1 is the highest (best) outcome. Categories are determined and plotted on maps and can be either 3 or 5 categories. Three categories enable outcomes similar to the low, medium and high outcomes derived for macro water sharing plans, while five categories provide a greater level of range in outcomes within a catchment. Where data is available, HEVAE scores are reported at the river reach level. Diversity: Macroinvertebrate Family data is used for Macroinvertebrate.\n\n\n\nLineage Statement\n\nDiversity and were obtained from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (J. Miller pers. comm.), who undertake regular AUSRIVAS monitoring in NSW. Data was collected at specific sites between 2004 and 2012. Macroinvertebrate scores were derived and placed into 4 diversity categories based on the number of Families recorded at each site. Fish Diversity data, also site- based, was obtained from the NSW DPI Fisheries. Data was derived from a State-wide sampling program dataset, with sampling occurring between January 2002 and 2011. Biodiversity scores were derived from the dataset, and placed into 4 fish diversity scores between 0 to 1 (highest). Site-based scores are associated with the river reach where sampling occurred and\n\nupstream and downstream River Styles&#xAE; category. Distinctiveness: Threatened species websites for NSW Office of Environment and\n\nHeritage, NSW DPI Fisheries and the Commonwealth Department of Environment were evaluated using the available specific search tools\n\nthat could provide outcomes at catchment or NRM regional level. If there was uncertainty about the occurrence of a threatened species,\n\npopulations or endangered ecological communities, additional information (eg Profile of Final Determinations) on each relevant website was also inspected. Site based data was obtained from the NSW Atlas of NSW Wildlife. In addition to applying weightings of flow sensitivity, weightings related to threat status, and accuracy of record were also applied. Rare River Styles&#xAE; were determined using the expert assessment by a river geomorphologist of the presence (by total reach length or proportion of lengths) of each River Style&#xAE; category in proximity to strategic recovery reaches, the potential of overall River Style&#xAE; to recover, level of isolation and representation of a particular attribute. The River Styles&#xAE; spatial data is held by the NSW Office of Water. Naturalness: Initially, five attributes were used to report on naturalness, however the macroinvertebrate condition outcomes were removed due to the spurious outcomes this dataset influenced in the naturalness outputs. Flow sensitivity weightings of 1 are applied to each of the four remaining attributes. Attributes used in these criteria include: Geomorphic condition - was reported based on the mapped recovery potential outcomes of river reaches, that are closest to unimpaired or easily recoverable to natural conditions. Data was derived from the Office of Water The River Styles&#xAE; spatial data. Hydrologic Stress - data is derived originally from the macro water sharing plan hydrologic stress assessment, and later from the River Condition Index Risk analysis. Hydrologic stress in the Hunter-Central Rivers region was calculated using two process, i) distributed hydrologic stress for most of the catchment and ii) macro water sharing plan hydrologic stress for the remainder, mostly smaller coastal catchment areas. Full details on each method can be found in the River Condition Index technical manual at:\n\nhttp://www.water.nsw.gov.au/watermanagement/monitoring/catchments Catchment Disturbance Index (CDI) - Final catchment index scores developed for the NSW River Condition Index were used. Data custodian is the NSW Office of Water. CDI outcomes were derived from three sources: i) infrastructure (eg. Roads, railways, utilities...etc) density (from the Office of Water centralised Enterprise database), ii) land use index derived from the Australian Land Use mapping project based crop types, mining and urban uses, forest and plantations, grazing and managed resource areas, and iii) Land Cover Change Index based on loss of woody vegetation derived from the Land and Tree Study (SLATS) method applied by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. River reaches within National Park Estate - The National Parks Estate spatial layer was obtained from the NSW Office of Water Enterprise database. Where the National Park estate polygon intersected a stream (with a 50m buffer either side), a score of 1 was applied to the river reach. Remaining river reach scores were a 0. Vital Habitat: Only one attribute had useful spatial data for this criterion and related the occurrence of Directory of Important Wetlands Australia and RAMSAR wetlands. A 50m buffer along the River Styles stream line was used to intersect and vital habitat wetlands above the tidal limit. NOTE: Vital habitat was not included in the final HEAVE assessment due to some anomalies the attribute produced, however Vital Habitat maps were produced to assist with the assessment. The final or overall HEVAE score was determined for each River Style reach. This was calculated by adding together the final weighted and normalised scores for each criteria (Naturalness, Diversity and Distinctiveness - no Vital Habitat wetlands detected so not included in final computations). This score was then normalised by divided by the maximum combined HEVAE score for the whole Hunter Central Rivers river reaches to provide an even spread of score outcomes between 0 (lowest) and 1 (highest).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2014) Hunter Rivers High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystem NSW Office of Water 20141124.

    "description": "Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species and as other specially protected fauna in WA under Schedule 7 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2015). Gaps in our knowledge in Western Australia include having a good understanding of the species’ distribution, abundance and high use areas across the northwest.\nThis 3-year project (2014-2017) integrated Indigenous knowledge and scientific observations from field surveys to better understand the distribution, abundance and movements of dugong in the Kimberley region. The data collected also provides a baseline for future monitoring and management.\nThis medata record relates to raw and processed aerial survey data of marine fauna collected between 21st September 2015 and 8th October 2015 in Kimberley coastal waters to the 20m bathymetry line, comprising dugongs (Dugong dugon), Australian snubfin dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni), other dolphins (bottlenose, spinners, false killer whales), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and large, mostly green turtles (Chelonia mydas). \nThe WA Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions (DBCA, ex-DPaW) and CSIRO provided additional resources to extend the North Kimberley dugong aerial survey boundary westwards (Broome to just past Port Hedland) to cover the South Kimberley-Pilbara coastal regions, to close the last remaining knowledge gap of the dugong distribution and abundance in Australia. This additional survey was completed in May 2017.\nData from a trial movement study undertaken between 1-18th August 2016 also forms part of this metadata record. Five dugongs were tagged with Telonics manatee/dugong tags. GPS and ARGOS satellite detection locations and dive data were downloaded weekly from the ARGOS web site.",

    "description": "This proposal aims to constrain burst rates and spin down properties of a sample of new Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) discovered with the ASKAP CRAFT Coherent upgrade (CRACO) system. Over the past 12-months of commissioning, CRACO discovered and precisely localised 15 new RRATs, characterised by their sporadic pulses with dispersion measures (DM) consistent with Galactic sources. We request 22.5h of Parkes time split into three 30min observations spanning 6-months for each target. This can help constrain periods and potentially phase-coherent timing solutions given that we already have arcsec-precision interferometric localisations. Our main science goals are: 1) to measure their burst rates, periods, and spin-down properties; 2) to assess their nulling fraction and intermittency; 3) to measure their polarimetric properties and constrain their emission mechanism; 4) to determine if the CRACO RRATs are fundamentally different from the known RRAT population. Some of these goals can be answered even with the detection of a limited number of pulses.",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - New South Wales Monthly Trains Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2020",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in New South Wales (NSW), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of New South Wales connected by Sydney trains (T1-T9) and Metro services (Metro North West line) have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC11) was collected from a depth of 502 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The percentage of calcium carbonate in samples collected from different depths were analysed, along with other parameters, to determine changes in carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx. The results indicate that CaCO3% increases rapidly at the terminations, with highs during the interglacials and as low as 50% during some of the glacials. The CaCO3% highs of around 85% coincide with very low sedimentation rates of <1 cm/kyr and are probably dominated by pelagic productivity.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

This service supports requests in multiple coordinate reference systems.\nA land parcel is an area of land with defined boundaries, under unique ownership for specific property rights or interests.\nA property is something that is capable of being owned, in the form of real property (land). The interest can involve physical aspects, such as the use of land, or conceptual rights, such as a right to use the land in the future.\nThe NSW cadastre is an up-to-date parcel-based land information system which contains a unique identifier which can be linked of interests in land (i.e. rights, restrictions and responsibilities). The cadastre includes a geometric definition of land parcels linked to other records, such as land titles, describing the nature of the interests, the ownership or control of those interests, and often the value of the parcel and its improvements.\nA cadastral product or service visualises the boundaries of land parcels, often buildings on land, the parcel identifier, and basic topographic features.\nThe land parcel and property theme provide the foundation fabric of land ownership.  It consists of the digital cadastral database and associated parcel and property information.\n<b>Property - </b>Property data is a polygon feature class that spatially represents an aspatial property description as provided by Property NSW in their Valnet database.\nProperties are divided into three categories:\n<ul><li>Property (complete)</li><li>Incomplete</li><li>Other</li></ul>\n\nLand and property data underpins the economic, social and fabric environment of Australia and is used, amongst other things, to:\n<ul><li>secure tenure for access to capital</li><li>define allowable use of land</li><li>manage native title, nature conservation, heritage protection, defence, and disaster management</li><li>improve infrastructure and property development planning</li><li>water and carbon accounting programs.</li></ul>\n\nThe Spatial Services digital cadastral data maintenance program captures all changes to the statewide cadastral fabric from new survey plans and a variety of other sources.\nThe cadastral data upgrade program is improving the spatial accuracy of the cadastral fabric by using survey dimensions and improved survey control. Upgrades are carried out together with the relevant Local Government Authority and are further facilitated through the incorporation of data provided by Local Government Authorities, Hunter Water and Sydney Water.\nUpgrade positional accuracy varies across the state and generally ranges from less than 5m from true position in rural areas to less than 0.2m from true position in urban areas, dependent on the survey control available.\nData quality in both Cadastral Maintenance and Cadastral Upgrade is assured through specification compliance and datatopology rules.\nSpatial Services is currently undertaking a cadastral supply chain digital transformation initiative thorough the Cadastre NSW Program.\nSpatial Services continuously updates this theme with information sourced from relevant stakeholders and custodians. Most updates to the datasets in this theme originate from subdivision, registration and gazettal activity.\nSpatial Services works with Local and State Government to upgrade the accuracy of Spatial Services Defined Administrative Data Sets.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)OtherWGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentFull stateContent LineagePlease contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityPlease contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Terms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

The indicators include: Remoteness from Settlement, Remoteness from Access, Apparent Naturalness and Biophysical Naturalness, and were derived from the definition of Wilderness Quality as the extent to which a location is remote from and undisturbed by the influence of modern development.\n\nThe NWI database consists of all measurements used to derive wilderness indicator values, the wilderness indicator values themselves, and a final Wilderness Quality index.\n\nThis is an archived dataset owned by the Commonwealth Government under the NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Data Agreement of 31 March 2000.This data is available to the public from the Department and may be used by third parties for unrestricted use provided that the copyright interests of the owners are protected.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia 1997.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "The Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions dataset has been prepared for the purpose of reporting on the Australian Government's Caring for our Country investments. The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Caring for our Country projects might take place and includes major islands; external territories; state and coastal waters; in addition to the 56 NRM regions. This version of the data is an update and formalisation of the 'interim 2010' dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset- publicly released in Feb 09).\n\nWhilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\n\nCaring for our Country commenced on 1 July 2008. It integrates delivery of the Australian Government's previous natural resource management programs, including the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Landcare Program, the Environmental Stewardship Program and the Working on Country Indigenous land and sea ranger program.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement.

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in tropical pasture using eddy covariance techniques.  The site was identified as tropical pasture dominated by species <em>Chamaecrista rotundifolia</em> (Round-leaf cassia cv. Wynn), <em>Digitaria milijiana</em> (Jarra grass) and <em>Aristida sp.</em> standing at approximately 0.3m tall. The soil at the site was a mixture of red kandosol and deep sand. Elevation of the site was close to 70m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site was 1250mm. Maximum temperatures ranged from 37.5°C (in October) to 31.2°C (in June), while minimum temperatures ranged from 12.6°C (in July) to 23.8°C (in January). Maximum temperatures varied on a seasonal basis between 6.3°C while minimum temperatures varied by 11.2°C.   The instrument mast was 15 meters tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements were taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation were measured. Ancillary measurements taken at the site included LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, N and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the transect in September 2008.  The site was destroyed by fire in September 2013.

    "description": "The dataset shows the location and spatial extent of aquatic ecosystems and their potential dependence on the surface expression of groundwater. It shows aquatic ecosystems at a scale of 1:100 000 and is best viewed at this scale. Not all ecosystems are present in the dataset, smaller aquatic ecosystems requiring a higher resolution are not displayed.\n\nAquatic ecosystems that are known or likely to interact with groundwater in their hydrological cycle are potentially groundwater-dependent. The aquatic groundwater-dependent ecosystem (GDE) dataset shows the location of aquatic ecosystems and their GDE potential in the Fitzroy water planning area. The aquatic ecosystems included in the final dataset are categorised as:\n+ Base-flow rivers\n+ Wetlands\n+ Estuarine and near shore marine\n+ Springs.  \n\nRiver base flow systems – River systems and associated riparian vegetation are unique ecosystems providing a habitat for threatened and priority flora and fauna, including native aquatic species and birds.\nBase flow is a component of the total stream flow that is supported by groundwater discharge. River permanence and flow duration indicate groundwater dependence during periods of low or no rainfall supporting differing ecosystem processes.\nThere are several permanent riverine pools found on the main Fitzroy River channel. \n\nWETLANDS – wetlands that have a known or likely element of groundwater discharge in their hydrological cycle will be considered groundwater dependent. \nWetlands are areas of seasonally, intermittently or permanently waterlogged or inundated land, whether natural or otherwise, such as lakes, swamps, pools, springs, and damplands. \nThe hydrogeology of the Fitzroy water planning area is complex and variable. Hydrogeology mapping and a hydrogeologist should be consulted to determine the groundwater source of a wetland.\n\nESTUARINE AND NEAR SHORE MARINE - Estuarine habitats are classified as components of an estuary, partially enclosed by land, with a continuous or intermittent connection to the ocean. With a freshwater influence from overland run-off, there is diluting and mixing of seawater. These habitats can include estuarine wetlands, lagoons, salt marshes, and mangroves. \nNear shore marine habitats are exposed to the waves and currents of the open ocean. Their water regimes are dominated by the ebb and flow of the ocean and tend to have a high salinity, normally greater than 33%. These habitats include seagrass meadows, coral, and stromatolites. The Fitzroy, May, Meda, and Robinson Rivers flow into the King Sound, supporting many different near shore marine habitats. Seagrass meadows, mangrove forests and salt flats are known to occur \nin and around the King Sound.\n\nSPRINGS - Springs provide a permanent source of freshwater and are recognised as important aquatic ecosystems found throughout the Australian landscape. The occurrence of permanent water in arid landscapes provides stable long-term habitat, critical to flora and fauna during dry periods, especially in the north-western region of Western Australia. A spring can be described as having a permanent discharge or flow of groundwater at the surface.",

    "description": "This proposal aims to constrain burst rates and spin down properties of a sample of new Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) discovered with the ASKAP CRAFT Coherent upgrade (CRACO) system. Over the past 12-months of commissioning, CRACO discovered and precisely localised 15 new RRATs, characterised by their sporadic pulses with dispersion measures (DM) consistent with Galactic sources. We request 22.5h of Parkes time split into three 30min observations spanning 6-months for each target. This can help constrain periods and potentially phase-coherent timing solutions given that we already have arcsec-precision interferometric localisations. Our main science goals are: 1) to measure their burst rates, periods, and spin-down properties; 2) to assess their nulling fraction and intermittency; 3) to measure their polarimetric properties and constrain their emission mechanism; 4) to determine if the CRACO RRATs are fundamentally different from the known RRAT population. Some of these goals can be answered even with the detection of a limited number of pulses.",

As a result, DPIRD has retired the following products:  \n\n•   Swan Coastal Plain Remnant Vegetation 2000 (DPIRD-089) \n\n•   Swan Coastal Plain Remnant Vegetation 2005 (DPIRD-090) \n\n•   Swan Coastal Plain Remnant Vegetation 2010 (DPIRD-091) \n\n•   Swan Coastal Plain Remnant Vegetation 2015 (DPIRD-092) \n\n•   Swan Coastal Plain Remnant Vegetation 2020 (DPIRD-093) \n\n•   Data in the area covered by the DWER products was excised from Native Vegetation Extent (DPIRD-005).\n\nThe DWER native vegetation extent datasets for the Swan Coastal Plain, Metropolitan and Peel Region Scheme areas include:\n\n•   <a href=\"https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-perth-peel-native-vegetation-extent-2000\">Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel Native Vegetation Extent 2000 (DWER -136)</a> \n\n•   <a href=\"https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-perth-peel-native-vegetation-extent-2005\">Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel Native Vegetation Extent 2005 (DWER -137)</a>  \n\n•   <a href=\"https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-perth-peel-native-vegetation-extent-2010\">Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel Native Vegetation Extent 2010 (DWER -138)</a>  \n\n•   <a href=\"https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-perth-peel-native-vegetation-extent-2015\">Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel Native Vegetation Extent 2015 (DWER -139)</a> \n\n•   <a href=\"https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-perth-peel-native-vegetation-extent-2020\">Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel Native Vegetation Extent 2020 (DWER -140)</a> \n\n•   <a href=\"https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-perth-peel-native-vegetation-extent-2024\">Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel Native Vegetation Extent 2024 (DWER -141)</a>  \n\n<strong>History</strong>\n\nThis was originally compiled as part of the vegetation theme of the National Land and Water Resource Audit (NLWRA). The data for the intensive land-use zone (ILZ) in south-western Australia was originally derived from 1995 LandSat TM satellite imagery and has been corrected using digital aerial photography (orthophotos) acquired 1996 to 2020. The extensive land-use zone (ELZ) is presumed to carry vegetation cover except for the major irrigated areas at Kununurra and Carnarvon. These have been removed from extent mapping for the ELZ. \n\nThe dataset was progressively updated by the Department of Agriculture post-NLWRA with assistance the Department of Conservation and Land Management until 2020. \n\nA one-off update was carried out in May 2023. \n\nNo further updates are planned.",

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.  Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:3857WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Terms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~130cm depth, corresponding to isotopically heavier 18O. The 13C appears to lag the 18O signal with the minimums just proceeding the glacial maximums in the 18O.",

The data is based on 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp. Other Territories (LGA code 99399) were split across two records in the original data, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

CAP is an open data standard that is developed and maintained by OASIS, a USA-based open standards organisation. CAP is an international xml encoding standard that facilitates the construction and exchange of all-hazard emergency alert and warning messages between various alerting technologies, systems and networks. CAP enables a single warning message to be prepared for dissemination simultaneously over a wide variety of warning systems that understand and can process CAP-formatted messages. \r\n\r\nThe standardised alerts produced using CAP can be exploited by a wide range of software applications and technology devices, each capable of processing the message and responding accordingly. Examples of the kinds of sensor and alerting technologies that can interoperate using CAP messages are data networks, landline and mobile phones, internet, fax, pagers, sirens, billboards and electronic road signs. \r\n\r\nEarly versions of CAP have been in use since 2009 in the various Australian jurisdictions and Commonwealth agencies that are responsible for distributing emergency warning messages to the Australian community. These existing implementations were used as the baseline to develop the common national approach used in this CAP-AU standard. \r\n\r\nFor further information about the CAP-AU standard please contact the CAP-AU Custodian at cap-au@bom.gov.au or visit http://purl.org/cap-au/web/About.shtml\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Statement / Copyright Notice - Use of the CAP-AU-STD documents shall be in accordance with the Intellectual Property Statements and Copyright Notices detailed within each CAP-AU-STD document downloaded from this collection",

    "description": "The __Water for Fodder__ program is part of the Australian Government's Drought Response, Resilience and Preparedness Plan.\r\n\r\nUnder the program, 40 gigalitres of water was produced from the Adelaide Desalination Plant and an equivalent amount released upstream from the River Murray.\r\n\r\nFarmers in the southern connected Murray–Darling Basin were able to apply to purchase South Australian River Murray water (Trading Zone 12) at a discounted rate. The water had to be used to grow fodder and pasture. This helped farmers to maintain their breeding stock during the drought.\r\n\r\n__Round 1__ of the program opened on 11 December 2019 and due to over-subscription, closed on 13 December 2019. Under round 1, 800 parcels of 50 megalitres of water were available at $5,000 ($100 per megalitre).\r\n\r\nFollowing the review of Round 1 and consultation with South Australia, the Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia, the Hon. Keith Pitt MP, has announced that there will not be a second round of the Water for Fodder program. \r\n\r\nRemaining funding will be redirected to other programs that benefit farmers and communities in the Murray–Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nWhile Round 1 was successful, more water is available in the southern Basin due to autumn rainfall. This has reduced the need for a second round as an emergency drought response. \r\n\r\nRead more about the Water for Fodder Program here: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/mdb/programs/basin-wide/water-for-fodder",

    "title": "National Intertidal Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme",
    "description": "It is widely known that classification schemes 'provide a framework to organize research and management efforts and to provide a common set of identifiers for those participating in these activities' (Tenore et al., 2006). At any scale of activity, an agreed set of identifiers or habitat classes facilitate and enable management actions and research and this becomes even more powerful the broader the agreement. This rationale provided the impetus behind the development and adoption of the National Intertidal Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 in 2007 (Appendix 3; Mount and Bricher, 2008). The Scheme was originally designed by integrating existing classification schemes (e.g. Kvitek et al., 1999; Bancroft, 2002; Ball et al., 2006; Rule et al., 2007) and defining broad habitat classes which are hierarchical, comprehensive, mutually exclusive, relatively sensor independent and well defined. This allowed for national reporting and comparisons while simultaneously enabling States/Territory and regions to define finer levels of classes for particular purposes (for example, MPA planning). The coverage of the first version of the Scheme was between the Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT) mark and the approximate outer limit of the photic zone (usually 50 – 70 m depth) and included all of Australia’s Coastal Waters (i.e. within the 3 nm boundary). This area includes a wide variety of habitat types ranging from intertidal mangroves and saltmarshes to nearshore subtidal benthic habitats such as seagrasses, reefs and macroalgae. A reference area of 9 m² (3 m x 3 m quadrat or its equivalent in transect mapping) was specified for determining dominance of substrate or biota (see Appendix 3; Mount and Bricher, 2008).Data to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\nUsers must attribute the Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2020)* is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia’s Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nAustralia’s National Forest Inventory has previously used the four derived category combinations of Dillon et al. (2015) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/IndigenousForestEstate_20150828_v1.0.0.pdf) for reporting the Indigenous estate in *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2013* and *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2018*. These four categories combined in various ways the individual attributes of the Indigenous estate, with an area of land or forest being allocated to only one of the four categories. However, the categories did not allow separate reporting on Indigenous ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.​\r\n\r\nThe methodology described in Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/publications/indigenous-estate-report) disentangles the four categories of Dillon et al. (2015), and allows separate reporting of each of Indigenous ownership of land or forest, Indigenous management or co‑management of land or forest, and land or forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have other special rights. Separate spatial coverages were created for each of these attributes, and this new dataset can form the basis for subsequent reporting on the relationships between Indigenous peoples and land or forest.\r\n\r\nThe methods and data in this data package use the same sources of data used for assembling the *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* spatial dataset, but presents the information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes ownership, management of co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology of Jacobsen et al. (2020). The Indigenous land dataset is also combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset.​ The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the *Australia's State of the Forests Report* Series.
