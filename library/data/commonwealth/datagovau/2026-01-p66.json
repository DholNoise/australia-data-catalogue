This layer contains polygon features delineating the current Country Fire Authority District Boundaries.\nCFA has moved to align their administrative boundaries to the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries and Victorian Local Government Boundaries. As a result of this direction, from 1st July 2010, what was once known as CFA Regions will now be known as CFA Districts.\nOriginally there were 20 Districts in this dataset.  A new district (District 27) was added on 29 October 2015 bringing the total to 21 Districts.\nThe Districts are based on Victorian Local Government Boundaries. There are two exceptions in this dataset. In June 2011, Bass Coast Shire became part of District 8 when the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries indicated that it should be part of District 9. In October 2012, Yarriambiack Shire was divided using the east-west rabbit fence (same\nas the Total Fire Ban District Boundary) which impacts on the District 17 and 18 Boundary.",

    "description": "This layer was produced by the Organic Soils Mapping (OSM) project, a project undertaken by DPIPWE Natural Values Conservation Branch between 2019 and 2021. This project received grant funding from the Australian Government through the Australian Heritage Grants Program, funding from 2017 Tasmanian Bushfire Mitigation fund and The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area fund. This project has used existing (legacy) data from previous Tasmanian land resource assessment studies, spatial data sets, expert desktop inputs, and newly captured site data from the AHG grant project activities. This project has collated these data to produce this and a further 6 spatial layers that show (presence /absence sites) and predict the likely distribution and characteristics of Organic Soils in Tasmania.\nThe project was focused on the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA), with modelling applied state-wide to assist in organic soil identification elsewhere.\nThe Organic Soil Mapping was undertaken to specifically identify organic soil extent in the TWWHA and to increases the understanding of the organic soil landscapes and characteristics in greater Tasmania. Organic soil areas are recognised globally as ecologically significant. These landscapes support a diverse range of ecosystems. They also provide and control ecosystem services/processes and provide highly valued carbon and water storage functions. These project outputs aim to improve and assist conservation and management of these important soil landscapes. The mapping was performed using a combination of 30m resolution modelling (Digital Soil Mapping (DSM)), expert digitising, with TASVEG, soil mapping and wetlands datasets as masks.  A DSM approach was chosen due to the sparse and limited nature of existing and new field data due to the remote and difficult access.  DSM involves using soil site data, intersected with a range of spatial environmental predictor datasets (covariates) to develop a series of landscape models, showing the variation in various soil properties between calibration points through interpolation and extrapolation (Kidd et al 2015).  A range of OSM characteristics; extent and likelihood, depth, and drainage were combined into a map of classified characetristics.",

    "description": "Core MD88-787 was recovered during the French ASPARA IV cruise in 1988, aboard the Marion Dufresne. The core was located on the Tasman Fracture Zone of the Mid-Ocean Ridge, within the Polar Front Zone.  \n\nSediment samples were taken at 10cm intervals. Isotopic analysis was performed on tests of the planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (200-250um), and revealed that the core covered two climatic cycles. The base of the core was found to represent the end of isotope-stage 7, as was suggested by the last abundant appearance datum (LAAD) of H. karstenii.\n\nThe core contained 195kyr of sedimentation within its 1030cm length. The results also indicate that the Holocene period has the highest rates of sedimentation observed through time. Further variations (excluding isotope-stage 1) appear to indicate that a reduction of the sedimentation rate occurred during the interglacial periods, in contrast to that of the glacials.",

    "title": "Haslams Creek Flood Study",
    "description": "THE STUDY AREA\nHaslams Creek drains a catchment area of about 17km2 in the Auburn Council Local\nGovernment Area. Figure 1 defines the catchment and the major drainage branches\nwhile all the modelled drainage branches are shown in greater detail in Figure 8.\nLand use within the catchment is mostly residential with pockets of industrial and\ncommercial land use while the south-eastern portion of the catchment also includes a\nportion of the Rockwood Cemetery.\nThe main creek is a concrete lined channel upstream of Parramatta Road but has an\nunlined invert and lined banks between Parramatta Road and the M4 Motorway. The\ncreek channel downstream of the M4 Motorway has recently been reconstructed as part\nof the Olympic Village development. This flood study is only concerned with the portion\nof the catchment upstream of the M4 Motorway.\nThe trunk drainage system for the catchment includes various stormwater channels and\npipe networks which discharge into Haslams Creek. The various tributary stormwater\nchannels are all lined. There are numerous structures along the length of the channels,\nmainly road and rail crossings, but there are also some instances of residential and\nindustrial developments spanning the channels.\nThe extent of trunk drainage system analysis was defined in the Study brief (see\nAppendix A) and is also summarised in Table 1. Some parts of the trunk drainage\nsystem, including Haslams Creek, are under the control of Sydney Water while other parts\nof the system are under the control of Auburn Council, as also summarised in Table 1.\nOverbank flooding of the open channel systems and surcharging of the pipe drainage\nsystems have occurred during large rainfall events, such as those occurring in November\n1961, August 1986 and January 1996. Areas of the catchment which have experienced\nproblems in the past include:\n\nVivian Crescent, which is drained by a small capacity pipe, and also experiences\noverland flow from the Railway Culverts Sub-Branch and from Campbell St;\nBachell Street, Delhi Street and between Simla Street and Parramatta Road on the\nArthur Street Branch;\nbetween James Street and East Street on the Joseph Street Branch;\nFrederick Street and Sweet Street (upstream of the Motor Registry) on the Church\nStreet Branch;\nbetween Dartbrook Road and Holliday Lane on the St Hilliers Road Branch; and\nbetween Harrow Road and Dudley Street on the Auburn Heights Branch.\n\nREASONS FOR STUDY\nWhile there has been occasions of overflow of the trunk drainage systems and associated \ninundation of adjoining lands the extent of such inundation may be substantially greater\nduring large storm events. Therefore Council required a study to define such flood\nbehaviour to use as a basis for floodplain management.\nVarious studies to derive design flood levels and discharges for certain parts of the\ncatchment have been undertaken but there were some inconsistencies in the results of\nthese studies. Council therefore commissioned a review of those studies. The resulting\n1996 Bewsher Consulting Review of Haslams Creek Flood Studies report (Reference 1)\nreviewed all of the previous flood studies for Haslams Creek and found that:\n\na large number of flood investigations had been completed within the study area.\nThose studies utilised various hydrologic and hydraulic models, various ground\nsurvey data, various modelling assumptions (e.g. extent of flood storage), various\nassumptions concerning modelling of hydraulic structures, various techniques for\nmodel calibration and verification, various assumptions concerning development\nconditions within the catchment, etc. The geographical coverage of each study was\nalso different in most cases;\ngiven the nature of the Haslams Creek catchment, the models adopted for a flood\nstudy or floodplain management study needed to be able to simulate:\n(1)channel storage and floodplain storage adjacent to the existing channel system,\nespecially upstream of the numerous railway and road crossings;\n(2) affluxes at road and railway structures;\n(3) a mixture of subcritical and supercritical flow, including hydraulic jumps;\n(4) secondary overland flowpaths;\n(5) pipe system capacities, pit losses and flow in pipes with submerged outlets;\nnone of the previous studies had adequately modelled all of these aspects. Most of\nthe previous studies had a limited geographical coverage. Also a number of small\nchanges have occurred in the catchment and the channel systems since the studies\nwere completed.\n\nConsequently, the study recommended that a new flood study be undertaken for the\nbranches upstream of the M4 Motorway.\nThe report included recommendations regarding hydrologic and hydraulic modelling. That\nis, a combination of RAFTS and ILSAX models were deemed suitable for the hydrologic\nmodelling of the open channels and piped systems respectively and a combination of\nMIKE-11 and/or HEC-RAS models were considered suitable for the hydraulic modelling\nof the open channels with hydraulic gradeline analyses of each pipe drainage system.\nThe methodology adopted for this report is consistent with those recommendations and\nis detailed in Section 4.\nIn accordance with Council's study brief (reference Appendix A) this report provides\nestimates of:\n\ndesign discharges for both the open channel and piped drainage systems for 5, 20\nand 100 year average recurrence interval (ARI) and probable maximum flood (PMF)\nevents;\ndesign flood levels, energy levels and velocities along the open channel system for\nthe 5, 20 ~nd 100 year ARI and PMF events;\nhydraulic and hazard categories for areas subject to overbank flooding; and\nthe capacity of the trunk pipe drainage system, the overland flow discharge and the \napproximate depth of overland flow.\n",

    "description": "Summary of species occurrence data from 1900 to 2020 for Australian marine species organised by IMCRA region and status as an introduced or invasive species using the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) list for Australia. Counts are provided by species and IMCRA region for:\n\nThe total number of occurrence records within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period\nThe number of distinct species recorded within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period  \n\nThe GRIIS list identifies species that are known or believed to have been introduced to Australia. Species that are not included in the GRIIS Australia list are treated here as native species. The GRIIS list also identifies a subset of introduced species as invasive species based on knowledge that these species have had a harmful impact. This dataset organises species occurrences using these GRIIS data to assign species to one of three categories:\n\nNative – not an introduced species\nIntroduced – an introduced species that is not considered invasive\nInvasive – an introduced species that is considered invasive  \n\nThe GRIIS lists have been compiled by experts with knowledge of introduced and invasive species in each country and are still being improved. It should particularly be noted that version 1.6 of the GRIIS Australia list includes a number of species which are native to Australia but which have been translocated to new parts of the country for conservation purposes. In future versions of the GRIIS Australia list, these species will be appropriately identified and can be excluded as required. This is important since the list does not indicate the areas in which the species is considered to have been introduced (including translocated). These species were manually excluded before the dataset was generated, but this version should be treated with caution. Future versions of this dataset will benefit from improvements to the GRIIS Australia list.  \nOccurrence records were aggregated and organised by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/) and include survey and monitoring data collected and managed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/).\nTo find out more about this dataset, visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/summary-data-introduced-species-occurrences-by-marine-ecoregion/\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.26197/ala.91179dd6-d56e-404f-97a7-ea6382307a17",

It visualises these boundaries of land parcels, often buildings on land, the parcel identifier, and basic topographic features.NSW Land Parcel and Property Theme provides the foundation fabric of land ownership.  It consists of the digital cadastral database and associated parcel and property information.NSW Land Parcel and Property Theme Lot is made up of the following features within the NSW Land Parcel and Property Theme.Cadastral Fabric – LotLot - Depicts a parcel of land created on a survey plan. Each lot may be represented by standard lots, standard part lots, strata or stratum. Each lot has a lot number, section number, plan lot area, plan number, plan label, Integrated Titling System (ITS) title status, and stratum label.Land and property data underpins the economic, social and environmental fabric of NSW and is used, amongst other things, to:<ul><li>Secure tenure for access to capital</li><li>Define allowable use of land</li><li>Manage native title, nature conservation, heritage, protection, defence, and disaster management</li><li>Improve infrastructure and property development planning</li><li>Inform water and carbon accounting programs</li></ul>Spatial Services continuously updates the Land Parcel and Property theme with information sourced from relevant stakeholders and custodians. The majority of updates to the datasets in this theme originate from subdivision, registration and gazettal activity.The data is up to date to within 10 working days from when a plan is lodged at NSW Land Registry Services. Data is also sourced from Crown Lands, the Office of Environment and Heritage, the Aboriginal Land Council, Local Land Services, the Electoral Commission and NSW Trade and Investment.The Cadastral upgrade program commenced in 2007 and is ongoing, improving the spatial accuracy of different feature classes. Upgrades are carried out in consultation with the relevant Local Government Authority and are further facilitated through the incorporation of data provided by external agencies. Upgrade positional accuracy varies across the state and generally ranges from less than 5m from true position in rural areas to less than 0.2m from true position in urban areas, dependent on the survey control available.Data quality for both Cadastral Maintenance and Cadastral Upgrade activities are assured through specification compliance and data topology rules. The client delivery database is automatically updated each evening with the changes that occurred that day in the maintenance environment.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)OtherWGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentFull stateContent LineagePlease contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityPlease contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Terms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "The aim of this project is to compile land use and management practices and their observed and measured impacts and effects on vegetation condition. The results provide land managers and researchers with a tool for reporting and monitoring spatial and temporal transformations of Australia’s native vegetated landscapes due to changes in land use and management practices. Following are the details about South Brooman State Forest, NSW. \n\nPre-European reference-analogue vegetation: The site was originally eucalypt tall open forest, multi-aged open, dry sclerophyll forest. The main overstorey species were spotted gum (<em>Corymbia maculata</em>), <em>Eucalyptus muelleriana</em>, <em>E. paniculata</em>, <em>E. pilularis</em>. The main understorey species were <em>Acacia spp.</em>, <em>Acmena spp.</em> \n\nBrief chronology of changes in land use and management:<ul>\n<li>1830: Unmodified</li>\n<li>1880: Area picked over for high quality sawlogs</li>\n<li>1945: Area picked over for high quality sawlogs</li>\n<li>1949: Sawlog harvesting - 85% of area</li>\n<li>1959: Sawlog harvesting - 85% of area</li>\n<li>1968: Commercial Thinning - 25% of area</li>\n<li>1969: Area left to rehabilitate</li>\n<li>1994: Wildfire - 100% of the area</li>\n<li>1996: Pole harvesting - 5% of area</li>\n<li>1998: Sawlog harvesting - 20% of the area</li>\n<li>1999 and 2003: Hazard reduction</li>\n<li>1997: Site was burnt (prescribed fire) followed by drought</li>\n<li>2004-2011:  Area left to rehabilitate</li>\n\n</ul>",

    "description": "Solitary Islands (Barrett, Jordan, Hayes):  Dives in the Solitary Islands were focused on surveying reef habitats around the Solitary Island Marine Park.  The surveys were conducted as part of a collaboration between the IMOS AUV Facility, the National Environment Research Program (NERP) Theme 1 - National monitoring, evaluation and reporting and NSW DPI Fisheries.  Dives focused on a number of reefs in 20 m to 60 m of water depth and consisted of both dense 25 m x 25 m full photo quadrants designed to allow repeat surveys over years and broader surveys up to 2km in length to document habitat distributions over broader scales.  Additional scientific operations carried out at these sites include multibeam bathymetry, towed video and Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS).",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'.

Area is not the principal basis for determining the predominant use. The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2019-20</em>.

It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity)\n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility.\nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Route Segment (Polyline) 2016\".\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website.

    "title": "Final report: National Marine Sediments Database and Seafloor Characteristics  Project",
    "description": "The National Marine Sediments Database and Seafloor Characteristics project is a collaborative effort between the National Oceans Office and Geoscience Australia. The aims of the project included identification and collation of existing marine sediment data within the Australian Marine Jurisdiction, development and population of the MARS sediments database and mapping and analysis of sediment data for the Northern Planning Area and the Australian region to provide information for the National Benthic Marine Bioregionalisation. \nThe creation of the MARS database marks the transition to a new era of easy internet access to quantitative seafloor information. This is the first project to critically assess the quality and coverage of Australia's seafloor sediment data on a national scale. The initial phase of the project was the identification and collation of sediment data. At the completion of this phase, the MARS database contained about 25,000 samples for which 138,000 properties had been recorded. \nMaps of sediment properties were produced using validated quantitative data for two regions: the Northern Planning Area (NPA) and the whole of the Australian Marine Jurisdiction, excluding external territories. These maps show the distribution of measured grain size data (weight percent gravel, sand and mud), calculated mean grain size, as well as sediment classification based on the Folk scheme (Folk, 1954), and carbonate content. Mean grain size data for six of the marine domains were used to model sediment mobility in waters less than 300 m depth, using Geoscience Australia's GEOMAT package. The results of the modelling were produced as maps of tide and wave exceedance, and an energy regime regionalisation. \nAs a direct result of this project, the MARS database is now an important scientific and educational resource for those requiring detailed information on seafloor sediment characteristics within the Australian Marine Domain areas. The maps generated by this project show the level of detail and type of presentation possible when using quantitative data, but significant gaps in measured data coverage were also identified. Some 70% of the total marine domain remains unmapped in terms of measured sediment data. Much of this area is off the continental shelf, although gaps in the data coverage on the shelf are significant, particularly in the South-west and West-central Marine Domains\nStrategic directions for improving the data coverage include the analysis of existing sediment samples from Australian and overseas repositories. A valuable resource of seabed samples stored in Australia and overseas has been identified. These samples, if analysed, have the potential to double the existing overall measured data coverage for Australia's Marine Domains and would provide a cost-effective way of generating new data. The South-west Marine Domain would provide a useful pilot study to test the utility of analysing existing material.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2009 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Land capability for annual horticulture in the south west of Western Australia based on analysis and interpretation of the best available soil-landscape mapping dataset (DPIRD-027).\n\nLand capability refers to the ability of land to support a type of land use without causing damage. See DAFWA Resource Management Technical Report 298 for a description of the qualities assessed and the methodology involved.\n\nThe assessment for annual horticulture covers the production of irrigated horticultural crops from plants with short-term life cycles (typically completed within the period of a year). Crops include annual fruits (strawberries, melons, etc.), vegetables (e.g. potatoes, lettuce, cabbages, tomatoes, pumpkins, etc.), commercial turf production and cut flowers. \n\nThe assumptions for the land use as assessed include: \n• crops are grown for commercial production \n• crops are shallow-rooted with most roots using only the top 50 cm of soil \n• crops are irrigated using sprinkler or trickle systems \n• mechanised cultivation occurs at least annually \n• fertilisers and herbicides, fungicides and/or pesticides are broadcast at least annually \n• crop rotation is practised \n• considers physical requirements only and ignores socio-economic factors. \n\nCapability ratings do not take into account factors such as the availability and quality of water supplies for irrigation or climatic risks such as frost or heat stress. Such factors need to be considered as a separate layer of information.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for Plant Health Australia  \r\n Overview  \r\n Experience from overseas indicates that the cost of an incursion by black-striped mussel is likely to be large without management. This report presents a comparison of the estimated costs associated with the alternative responses to an incursion: eradication and containment. Hypothetical incursions of black-striped mussel in ten case study areas across four Australian ports were considered. The cost of eradicating the initial mussel incursion from a case study area is compared to the cost of containing the mussel population to the port encompassing the case study area. The findings indicate that eradication is in most cases the preferred and less costly option over a range of time scales with the caveat that the likelihood of successful eradication will depend on early detection and response. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n•  Mytilopsis sallei  (black-striped mussel) is an invasive marine species that has been translocated from its native range in the Caribbean to a large number of ports in southern and eastern Asia. \r\n• An incursion of black-striped mussel in Darwin in 1999 was successfully eradicated at a cost of in excess of $3.2 million in 2012 terms. This species has been reported to have become established in a number of overseas trading ports, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai. The risks of translocation to Australia have therefore increased in recent years. \r\n• If an incursion by this species is not managed, it has the potential to cause significant and widespread economic and environmental damage. \r\n• A comparison of the costs associated with eradication with those of containment and control in a range of scenarios found that in many cases eradication is the preferred option, but containment and control may be preferred in some situations. \r\n",

    "description": "CSIRO Protected Area Representativeness Index (PARC: Representativeness) is a global 30 arc-second product for 1970,1980,1990,2000,2005,2010,2015, 2020, and 2024. The Protected Area Representativeness and Connectedness (PARC) indices measure the extent to which terrestrial protected areas, and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), are ecologically representative, and well-connected (both to one another, and to other areas of intact natural ecosystems in the surrounding landscape). For the purposes of reporting against the 2010-2020 Aichi Targets, the PARC was originally configured as two separate indicators: the Protected Area Representativeness Index (or ‘PARC-representativeness’) and the Protected Area Connectedness Index (or ‘PARC-connectedness’). However, these two indices were always designed in a manner which would allow them to be logically combined to yield a composite indicator of the extent to which a system of protected areas and OECMs is both ecologically representative and well-connected.  \n\nThe PARC indices, whether generated separately or as a composite, are used to monitor and report past-to-present trends in representativeness and connectedness by repeated calculation using best-available mapping of protected areas and OECMs at multiple points in time, e.g. for different years. They can also provide a foundation for assessing the contribution that potential additions to the system of protected areas and OECMs might make to improving present PARC scores, thereby providing a foundation for prioritising such actions.      \n\nThe PARC indices time series from 1970-2020 can be viewed on the UN Biodiversity Lab web map via the link in the Related Links section below.

This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

IPLoRD leverages IPGOD data to provide a history of an applicant’s filings over time broken down by financial year. Where available,\r\nthe ABN of the applicant is provided to allow linkage with other government research datasets.IPLoRD makes it possible for economists and other researchers to examine relationships between the filer’s economic circumstances and their intellectual property portfolio. IPLoRD is a biennial release. This year’s version of IPLoRD provides coverage of filing activities from 1904 to the end of 2020. <br />\r\n\r\nTo increase accessibility, IP Australia has provided IPLORD as a full-size single file, and as smaller files partitioned as the below time periods:<br /> \r\n\r\n* 1903 to 1990\r\n* 1991 to 1995\r\n* 1996 to 2001\r\n* 2001 to 2005\r\n* 2006 to 2010\r\n* 2011 to 2016\r\n* 2016 to 2020\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is for data underlying development of the wetland conservation significance methodology component of the Avon Baselining Project which ran from 2006 to 2009 and which was funded by the Avon Catchment Council (sites ABP001 to ABP150). The project also used data from the Drainage Evaluation Project (also known as the Wheatbelt Wetlands Project) which was funded by the Department of Agriculture and managed by the Wetlands Section (Species and Communities Program, DBCA) (sites ABP151-ABP180). The wetland mapping, classification and evaluations resulting from this methodology is available on the Corporate GIS dataset.\n\nThe biological and chemical data that form part of this dataset will be made available within NatureMap, but original data sheets are provided here.\n\nMajor products of the project were:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nA method for producing a stage 1 assessment of conservation value of Wheatbelt basin and granite outcrop wetlands.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nA stage 1 assessment of the conservation value of Wheatbelt basin and granite outcrop wetlands.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nA method for producing a stage 3 assessment of the conservation value of Wheatbelt wetlands.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nA stage 3 assessment of 30 Wheatbelt wetlands.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nA mapping layer of Wheatbelt basin and granite outcrop wetlands.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nA guide to Wheatbelt aquatic invertebrates and waterbirds.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe Avon Baselining project was run by Susan Jones and Lien Sim who supervised the methodology development and evaluations. The Drainage Evaluation Project was run by John Lizamore who supervised the wetland mapping component for both projects.\n\n<strong><em>Note: to access the data, select the data source link located on the right-hand side.</em></strong>",

    "description": "This dataset is a subset of the Sedimentary Basins dataset developed by Geoscience Australia. It represents those sedimentary basins in the South-west commonwealth marine planning region that are considered to be prospective for petroleum, and it has been attributed with a rating describing the relative prospectivity of different areas. This interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity is derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins. The classification terms used represent a simplified qualitative assessment of petroleum prospectivity, and are subject to future change as new data are gathered and interpreted.\n\nThe information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the South-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe Sedimentary Basins dataset itself provides outlines for the maximum extent of Australian geological provinces and their components, including sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic provinces, both onshore and offshore.  These data were compiled as part of Geoscience Australia's integrated digital information system to provide improved accessibility and knowledge relating to the petroleum and minerals geology and prospectivity, and to provide a national stratigraphic and tectonic framework for Australia.  The current Sedimentary Basins dataset is not complete for Australia, and covers only offshore sedimentary provinces and a selection of sedimentary and igneous provinces in onshore eastern Australia.The information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the South-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe following caveat applies to the use of the data in any mapping products:\n'The interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity are derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins.

Where an organisation has identified multiple outlets at one outlet address the Department has removed duplicate entries.\r\n\r\nEmergency Relief services are delivered by community organisations and help people address immediate basic needs by providing financial and/or material support in times of crisis.\r\n\r\nThe type of assistance offered by each organisation varies, however may include one-off assistance such as:\r\n\r\n* food, transport or chemist vouchers\r\n\r\n* part-payment of utility account/s\r\n\r\n* food parcels or clothing\r\n\r\n* budgeting assistance and/or\r\n\r\n* referrals to other services that help to address underlying causes of financial crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information has been extracted from data provided to the DSS by the Emergency Relief providers through the FOFMS online funding management portal.\r\n\r\nAs the nature of service delivery varies across regions, some community outreach services may not be reflected in the outlet information. The lead contracting organisation information may be presented in the data where sub-contracted organisations provide services. The address of some services such as those providing support or shelter to women escaping domestic violence have been withheld and outlet latitude/longitude coordinates assigned to the centre point of their SA3.\r\n\r\nFurther information about DSS funded services can be found at the DSS Grants Service Directory: http://serviceproviders.dss.gov.au/",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Program from sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. A landscape classification approach was used to determine how hydrological changes due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development may affect ecosystems at a landscape scale in the Isa GBA region. Nine landscape classes have been identified for the Isa GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nInputs into the landscape classification were based on existing classification schemes wherever possible and can be purely physical, biological or predictive. Choice of approach depends on the availability of data at an appropriate scale, as well as the expertise and resources for undertaking the assessment. Landscape classifications should be credible, transparent, logical and consistently applied; where possible, match other classifications (or at least some of their classes); and be feasible within available resourcing. The landscape classification developed for the Isa GBA region is based on Queensland Land Zones (Wilson and Taylor, 2012), which were supplied by the Queensland Government (State of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science), 2018) and assigned to corresponding landscape classes.\r\n\r\nState of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science) (2018) Biodiversity status pre-clear reg ecosys QLD 2018/03/01.

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

A short sea trial voyage (October 22 - 25, Hobart - Hobart) was undertaken prior to the charter. Data for those days is also included in this data set.\nThe Kongsberg EM122 multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry,  backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter.\nThe EM122 provides a 1 degree by 1 degree angular resolution. The echosounder's nominal frequency is 12 kHz.\nData are stored in .all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .wcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 1658 files totalling 58.5 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nTide corrections were not applied to the processed data. Processed data had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request.",

    "description": "Figures for ‘RBA foreign exchange transactions’, ‘Change in reserve assets due to valuation’ and ‘Total change in reserve assets’ refer to period totals. All other figures are end period values.\r\n\r\n‘RBA foreign exchange transactions’, sales (-) and purchases (+), are reported according to the date on which settlement takes place (‘value date’).\r\n\r\n‘Market’ transactions are foreign exchange transactions against the Australian dollar (excluding foreign exchange swaps) undertaken by the RBA with authorised foreign exchange dealers in Australia or banks overseas.\r\n\r\n‘Australian Government’ transactions are the RBA’s foreign exchange transactions with the Australian Government.\r\n\r\n‘Other outright’ transactions include the RBA’s outright transactions with other central banks, international financial institutions which are not intended to affect the exchange rate, clients other than the Australian Government, and interest received on holdings of foreign assets.\r\n\r\n‘Swap deliveries’ are RBA foreign exchange swap transactions that settled during the period, excluding swaps conducted with the Federal Reserve as part of the USD Swap Facility. For the period January 1995 until February 1996 ‘Other outright’ includes ‘Swap deliveries’.\r\n\r\n‘Official reserve assets’ comprise holdings of ‘Foreign exchange’, ‘Gold’ and ‘Other’ reserve assets, which comprise Special Drawing Rights, Reserve position in the IMF and the net value of swap transactions conducted with the Federal Reserve as part of the USD Swap Facility.\r\n\r\n‘Outstanding forward foreign exchange commitments’ mainly reflect market values of the second leg of RBA swap transactions outstanding and, from time to time, outstanding RBA outright forward transactions. Prior to July 2002 contract values are reported.\r\n\r\nThe sum of ‘Gold’ and ‘Foreign exchange’ may differ from figures reported in the weekly Statement of Liabilities and Assets and the RBA’s Annual Report. From 1 July 1996, foreign currency securities sold under repurchase agreements are retained for accounting purposes as foreign currency investments in the RBA’s balance sheet, in accordance with standard accounting treatment. For the purpose of reporting foreign exchange reserves in this table, however, securities sold under repurchase agreements are excluded. In addition, from 20 December 2006, foreign exchange sales (-) and purchases (+) are reported for accounting purposes according to the date on which they are contracted (‘trade date’). For the purpose of reporting foreign exchange reserves in this table, however, foreign exchange transactions are reported according to the date on which settlement takes place (‘value date’).\r\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes:\n    Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries\nas well as on a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web page to access these reports and for further information: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the forestry node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment; the only commodity in this node is Radiata pine. Maps are provided for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination contained in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations.",

    "description": "A tide gauge mooring was installed in 10-12m of water 200m off the west coast of Bowen Island, Jervis Bay. Opposed to other moorings in the area, this particular mooring did not house additional current meters. \n\nOver a period of approx. 9 months the mooring was deployed 4 times in the same location (as illustrated). \nDeployments 1-4  -35.1183 S 150.763 E. \nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 22/6/89 - 13/7/89... 2) 28/8/89 - 13/11/89... 3) 13/11/89 - 29/1/90... 4) 29/1/90 - 28/3/90.\n\nDatasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the tide gauge over the study period.\nThe Aanderaa WLR5 tide gauges used in this study average over 41 seconds for all sampling intervals. In the case of the 2nd and 3rd deployment the sampling interval was 15mins, while for the 4th deployment a sampling interval of 30mins was used. Unfortunately no data is available from the 1st deployment. \n\nThe tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~10m in all deployments. In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

The data spans the months of 2011 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "The Coffs Harbour (COF) HF ocean radar site is located near the point at which the East Australian Current (EAC) begins to separate from the coast.  Here the EAC is at its narrowest and swiftest: to the north it is forming from the westwards subtropical jet, and to the south it forms eddies and eventually the warm water moves eastwards across the Tasman Sea, forming a front with the cold water of the Southern Ocean.  \n\nThe connection between coastal and continental shelf waters is fundamental to the understanding of the anthropogenic impact on the coastal ocean and the role of the ocean in mitigating urban marine water quality. The oceans off Eastern Australia and in particular in the region of New South Wales have a complex circulation structure, and are strongly connected with other regional seas and currents. \n\nThe East Australia Current (EAC) flows from tropical regions southward along the NSW continental slope, bringing tropical biota southward. These current structures provide strong physical and biological connectivity, allowing substantial transport and dispersion of biota between regions, and influencing the transport and upwelling of nutrients, which are fundamental to biological productivity.  \n\nThe COF HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Red Rock (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) to the north of Coffs Harbour and North Nambucca (-24.111 S, 152.713 E) to the south.  The area of focus is off Coffs Harbour where IMOS and the NSW government have mooring sites.  These radars operate at a frequency of 13.920 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz and a maximum range of 100 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC14) was collected from a depth of 2004 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~80cm into the core. Two samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; from the sediment surface (GC14-0) representing interglacial sediment, while the second sample, from 80cm (GC14-80) represents glacial sediment. XRD analysis of these samples show a slight increase in carbonate percentage during the interglacial compared to the glacial, with increased clay and quartz during the glacial. During the interglacial there are minor amounts of Mg calcite, which suggests that there is little influence from the reef platform on the sediments during the present sea-level, or that the core is presently below the Mg calcite compensation depth.",

    "title": "River Risk Ratings",
    "description": "The River Risk Ratings provide a comprehensive view of how river condition and risk have been assessed across New South Wales over the past three decades. This collection brings together historic and contemporary datasets developed from the 1990s to the present, illustrating the evolution of assessment methodologies used to understand river health, hydrological stress, and ecological vulnerability. Together, these datasets link spatial layers, tabular data, and supporting reports — forming a single point of truth for understanding how NSW river systems have been evaluated through time. \n\nThe River Risk Ratings are comprised of three key components, each reflecting a distinct period and methodology in river risk assessment: \n\n<strong>1. River Risk Ratings – Historic Stress Rivers Assessment (1990s)</strong>\n\nA historic dataset derived from the original Stress Rivers Approach (SRA) developed during the 1990s, prior to the introduction of the Water Management Act 2000. This early method classified rivers according to stress indicators such as water extraction pressure and ecological condition. It represents one of the first systematic attempts to quantify river stress across NSW and serves as an important baseline for later risk assessments. \n\n<strong>2. River Risk Ratings – Historic Macro Risk Assessment (2000s)</strong>  <em>yet to publish</em> \n\nA historic risk dataset developed during the 2000s by water planners. This macro-level assessment expanded on the earlier SRA work by incorporating hydrological and ecological metrics to evaluate risk at the catchment scale. It informed early water-sharing and planning frameworks under the emerging Water Management Act 2000 and provides continuity between the early and modern risk assessment models. \n\n<strong>3. River Risk Ratings – Contemporary Risk Assessment (2016–Present)</strong> <em>yet to publish</em> \n\nThe current and ongoing statewide river risk dataset developed from 2016 to the present. It consolidates a decade of river risk ratings into a centralised database, supported by spatial layers and associated reports (including those linked to the MDBA Water Resource Plans). This represents the most up-to-date and standardised approach to river risk assessment in NSW and forms the operational basis for future updates. \n\n\n\n<strong>How to Access the Data on the SEED Open Data Portal</strong>\nThis landing page provides an overview only. To view or download the data, perform the following:\n<ol>\n<li>Scroll down and click “Related Datasets” (Dataset relationship).</li>\n<li>Select one of the listed datasets.</li>\n<li>On that dataset’s page, the data will either be available in the <strong>Dataset Packages</strong> section (if files are attached) or in the <strong>External Links</strong> section (if the dataset redirects you to another site to view or download the data).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

In due course, and allowing time for user feedback and testing, it is intended that the original service name will adopt this new 'multiCRS' functionality.Metadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleNSW Land Parcel and Property Theme multiCRSContent TypeHosted Feature LayerDescriptionNSW Land Parcel Property Theme MultiCRS is a polygon dataset that represents areas of land with defined boundaries, under unique ownership for specific property rights or interests. This service supports requests in multiple coordinate reference systems.A land parcel is an area of land with defined boundaries, under unique ownership for specific property rights or interests.A property is something that is capable of being owned, in the form of real property (land). The interest can involve physical aspects, such as the use of land, or conceptual rights, such as a right to use the land in the future.The NSW cadastre is an up-to-date parcel-based land information system which contains a unique identifier which can be linked of interests in land (i.e. rights, restrictions and responsibilities). The cadastre includes a geometric definition of land parcels linked to other records, such as land titles, describing the nature of the interests, the ownership or control of those interests, and often the value of the parcel and its improvements.A cadastral product or service visualises the boundaries of land parcels, often buildings on land, the parcel identifier, and basic topographic features.The land parcel and property theme provide the foundation fabric of land ownership.  It consists of the digital cadastral database and associated parcel and property information.Datasets that make up the Land Parcel and Property Theme include:Cadastral Fabric Lot - depicts a parcel of land created on a survey plan. Each lot may be represented by standard lots, standard part lots, strata or stratum. Each lot has a lot number, section number, plan lot area, plan number, plan label, ITS title status, and stratum label.Road - represents dedicated public roads which are open ways for the passage of vehicles, persons or animals on land. The road dataset includes public roads in use. Each road type has a section number, plan number, plan label, ITS title status, road type, road width or Crown/Council width, lot number, and stratum label.Unidentified - represents a parcel of land that cannot be identified. Crown land, vested, dedicated and severed land may be included in this category as well as Old System lots for which lot/DP identification cannot be found. This dataset also identifies the locations of 100ft wide reserves, ACT regions, closed roads, crossings, surveyed areas, and un-surveyed areas.Water feature - represents tidal, non-tidal and ocean waters which form a cadastral boundary.Cadastral Features Easement (including Carriageway) - depicts a right, attached to land (the dominant tenement), to use other land (the servient tenement) for a specified non-exclusive purpose known to the law, e.g. right of carriageway, easement to drain water etc. – however the law also recognises an easement in favour of a statutory authority without a dominant tenement, described as an ‘easement in gross’.Road Corridor - represents the spatial extent of the legal road networkRoad Centreline - represents a line that forms the centreline of cadastral road corridors.Railway Corridor - represents a part of the Land Parcel and Property Theme covering railway land that is not defined by a lot.Water feature Corridor - represents the extent of a water feature or the delineation between water features of a different type or status. The dataset contains high water mark, low water mark, the limit of tidal influence and bay closing lines.Watermark - represents the spatial extent of tidal, non-tidal and ocean waters which form a cadastral boundary.Authority Reference: depicts the changes to an area definition that has occurred through a gazettal, act or government file action.Property - Property data is a polygon feature class that spatially represents an aspatial property description as provided by Property NSW in their Valnet database.Properties are divided into three categories:Property (complete)IncompleteOtherLand and property data underpins the economic, social and fabric environment of Australia and is used, amongst other things, to:secure tenure for access to capitaldefine allowable use of landmanage native title, nature conservation, heritage protection, defence, and disaster managementimprove infrastructure and property development planningwater and carbon accounting programs.The Spatial Services digital cadastral data maintenance program captures all changes to the statewide cadastral fabric from new survey plans and a variety of other sources.The cadastral data upgrade program is improving the spatial accuracy of the cadastral fabric by using survey dimensions and improved survey control. Upgrades are carried out together with the relevant Local Government Authority and are further facilitated through the incorporation of data provided by Local Government Authorities, Hunter Water and Sydney Water.Upgrade positional accuracy varies across the state and generally ranges from less than 5m from true position in rural areas to less than 0.2m from true position in urban areas, dependent on the survey control available.Data quality in both Cadastral Maintenance and Cadastral Upgrade is assured through specification compliance and datatopology rules.Spatial Services is currently undertaking a cadastral supply chain digital transformation initiative thorough the Cadastre NSW Program.Spatial Services continuously updates this theme with information sourced from relevant stakeholders and custodians. Most updates to the datasets in this theme originate from subdivision, registration and gazettal activity.Spatial Services works with Local and State Government to upgrade the accuracy of Spatial Services Defined Administrative Data Sets.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW). For current information go to spatial.nsw.gov.auData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsNSW Land Parcel Property Theme of the Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF)AccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)OtherWGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentFull stateContent LineagePlease contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityPlease contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This classification of aquatic ecosystems was developed for the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office, Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Australia, and Murray-Darling Basin Authority to support the management of environmental water in the Murray-Darling basin.\nAn interim application of the Australian National Aquatic Ecosystem (ANAE) classification framework has been applied to all floodplain polygons. The associated data table contains the ANAE floodplain attributes and resulting typology. \n\nThis dataset is a merged product of three sources: Floodplain_MDBAv2_ANAE, Floodplain_SA_ANAE and Floodplain_RERP_ANAE.\n\nRERP_ANAE results from the merger of three separate 2009-2010 NSW Rivers Environmental Restoration Program (RERP) mapping layers for the Lowbidgee, Macquarie Marshes, and Gwydir wetlands. ANAE floodplain attributes and typology are assigned in the data table.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nLicenced for use under Creative Commons Australia Attribution. We request attribution as (c) Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Energy.\nVictoria\nVictoria maintains an inventory of wetlands (WETLAND_CURRENT) which is designed for use in Victorian wetland projects and is subject to ongoing validation and updates. WETLAND_CURRENT can be obtained from the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (see http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/forestry-and-land-use/maps-imagery-and-data\nfor further details). For lacustrine and palustrine aquatic ecosystems, the MDB_ANAE geodatabase is more suited to wetland projects involving other jurisdictions. While much of the data for lacustrine and palustrine wetlands was sourced from WETLAND_CURRENT, there may be some inconsistencies between MDB_ANAE geodatabase and WETLAND_CURRENT. The two datasets can be linked through the AltSrcID (MDB_ANAE geodatabase) and Wetland_No (WETLAND_CURRENT data set) fields.\nSA\nDue to the Basin-wide nature of this dataset, accuracy of final classes has not been ground truthed comprehensively, which could impact results of any analysis using this data. Therefore it is imperative that this dataset is assessed as to fitness for use in any application and decisions made about further levels of validation required. Significant care should be taken if information derived from this dataset is to guide decision making, form binding agreements regarding target setting, compliance of any form, or monitoring of achievements, this includes for the purpose of summarising areas of wetland types.

    "description": "This dataset contains audio files for Ti Tree East site. The site was established in 2012 at Pine Hill Station, near Alice Springs. Pine Hill is a functioning cattle station that has been in operation for longer than 50 years. The site is a mosaic of the primary semi-arid biomes of central Australia: grassy mulga woodland and <em>Corymbia</em>/<em>Triodia</em> savanna. The woodland is characterised by a mulga (<em>Acacia aneura</em>) canopy. The soil is red sand overlying an 8 m deep water table. Elevation of the site is 553 m above sea level, and the terrain is flat. Mean annual precipitation at the nearby (30&nbsp;km to the south) Bureau of Meteorology station is 306&nbsp;mm.\n\n\nIn 2012 an acoustic recorder was set up in hummock grassland to collect audio data for a total of 12 hours per day, split between six hours around dawn and six hours around dusk. The recording schedule aimed at capturing morning and evening bird choruses while minimizing memory and battery requirements. A long-term spectrogram has been generated for each audio file to aid in data exploration. The sensor also recorded temperature, minimum- maximum- and mean-sound pressure levels.\n\n\nAcoustic indices and false colour spectrograms were created for the recordings. Acoustic indices are summaries of the distribution of the acoustic energy in a recording. They are particularly useful for the analysis of long-term recordings of the environment and can be used to identify sound sources of interest, characterise the soundscape, aid in the assessment of fauna biodiversity, monitor temporal trends and track environmental changes. False colour spectrograms are visual representation of individual acoustic indices or combination of multiple indices. They can highlight the presence of specific sound sources, e.g. birds, insects or weather events, providing a tool for navigating long-term recordings.\n\n\nData are made available through the data link.

    "description": "We propose a modest program to continue monitoring 4 of the 6 known radio magnetars in order to achieve three primary science goals. The first is to characterise magnetar outbursts over long timescales, for which tracking their rotational, flux density, and polarisation properties provide a clear view of the impulse response of their magnetic fields. Second, understanding the links between magnetars the mysterious fast radio burst phenomenon through the discovery of rare emission and propagation effects, shared spectro-temporal phenomenology, and connections to high-energy (X-ray/gamma-ray) phenomena. Lastly, our continued monitoring has enormous benefit to the wider magnetar community, providing rapid alerts to changes in activity, adding context to unusual behaviour detected by high-enery observations, and a host of supplementary science through the teams extensive collaborative networks. The project and its precursors have been running since 2007 and have contributed to 21 publications since then. We are seeking to convert the project to long-term status, thereby also carrying these investigations into the SKA era.",

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2014 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2014 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2013 – 30 June 2014, for others it will be the 2014 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nAs at November 2016, approximately 46 000 registered charities have submitted their 2014 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2014 reporting period. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS asked information about charity finances for the first time. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greated detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "The WACHEM database is a compilation of multi-element geochemistry of rocks unconsolidated surface material (regolith) and drill core collected by the Geological Survey of Western Australia. Samples have been analysed for a range of major element oxides, trace elements, rare earth elements (REE), and isotopes by a variety of analytical approaches at commercial, government and university laboratories. In most cases, analysis of unknowns has been carried out along with samples of know composition (reference materials), a second sample of the unknown (sample duplicate), and material which does not contain detectable amounts of elements of interest (blank). These data are included with analysis of unknowns, and these quality control data can be used to gauge the quality of analysis. For inclusion in the geochemical database, analytical data for each element in each sample must include the unit of measurement, lower level of detection (LLD) of that element, and an indication of the analytical technique (usually specified as a laboratory-specific code). To minimise the inclusion of spurious data in the database, analytical batch data are loaded with reference to a set of look up tables, against which data can be checked for consistency. ",

This report for the 2018–19 monitoring period  is the first change report for a series of SLATS reporting which monitors and accounts for woody vegetation extent and change in Queensland, annually. The monitoring period is nominally from August 2018 to August 2019. The methodology monitors and reports change in woody vegetation extent against a 2018 woody vegetation extent baseline. Included in the data are information about the clearing activity type and estimates of woody vegetation density and age, to better describe what woody vegetation currently exists, and where and how it is being cleared. Regrowth reporting is not included in the 2018-19 data, as regrowth generally occurs on time scales greater than one year and existing regrowth in 2018–19 period has been mapped and characterised in the 2018 woody vegetation extent baseline.

The Territory Plan is the key statutory planning document in the ACT, providing the policy framework for the administration of planning in the ACT. It is changed from time to time due to social, economic and environmental reasons. The Territory Plan is used to manage development, in particular the way in which land is used and what can be built. It is used in assessment of development applications and to guide the development of new estate areas (future urban land).",

These surfaces and can be accessed using most 3D-software packages.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nOrr et al. (2020) published regional three-dimensional depth and isochore maps for key stratigraphic horizons of the Beetaloo Sub-basin and overlying Paleozoic (Georgina/Wise/Daly) and Mesozoic (Carpentaria) basins. These maps are based on: published depth maps of Frogtech Geoscience (2018a; 2018b), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NT) (2018a; 2018b), Randal (1973), Hutchinson et al. (2008); seismic interpretation of Williams (2019), and; additional modelled surfaces based on formation top picks contained in well completion reports (Northern Territory Government, 2018).

    "description": "Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) is the percentage of ground area occupied by the vertical projection of foliage. The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on an automated decision tree classification technique applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM  and Landsat-8 OLI imagery for the period 1988-2013. The wooded extent product has a nominal accuracy of 85%. The field data used to calibrate the imagery/FPC relationship was mostly collected over the period 1996-1999. Corrections have been applied to remove errors due to topographic effects, cloud, cloud shadow, water, cropping, and regrowth following clearing. Some errors may remain. The product was generated from WRS-2 path/row scenes obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). While some land cover change may be detected in the FPC processing, this product is not designed to generate clearing or regrowth following clearing layers, and should not be used to assess clearing or be compared with previous years for change monitoring. The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) produces accurate clearing layers for this purpose.",

    "description": "This dataset evaluates 'Ever-partnered women aged 18 years and over who experienced violence or emotional abuse by a partner they lived with'.\r\n\r\nCells in this table have been randomly adjusted to avoid the release of confidential data. Discrepancies may occur between sums of the component items and totals.\r\n\r\n'Physical violence' includes physical assault and/or physical threat.\r\n\r\n'Total violence' includes physical violence and/or sexual violence.\t\r\n\r\n'Total ever-partnered women' includes all women who have or had a partner since the age of 15.\t\r\n\r\n'Has a disability or long-term health condition' refers to a person who was defined as having a disability or long-term health condition if they had one or more conditions which had lasted, or were likely to last, for six months or more, and that restricted every day activities. People were identified as having a profound or severe core-activity limitation if they required help or supervision for one or more core activities, such as self-care, mobility or communication. For further information refer to the Glossary.\t Further, a specific requirement of the PSS was that interviews were conducted in private. Where a respondent required the assistance of another person to communicate with the interviewer, proxy interviews were conducted for a limited amount of the survey and this data was not retained on the final weighted file. Therefore it is likely that the PSS will under represent those with a profound or severe disability. For more details regarding proxy interviews refer to the Proxy section of the Survey Development and Data Collection page of the Personal Safety Survey, Australia: User Guide, 2016 (cat. no. 4906.0.55.003). Approximately 33% of respondents who reported a profound/severe disability, were not included in the final sample due to proxy use, or opting out.\r\n\r\n'Australia' includes external territories.\r\n\r\n'Main English speaking countries' includes Canada, Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States of America.\r\n\r\n'Other countries' are inadequately described.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
