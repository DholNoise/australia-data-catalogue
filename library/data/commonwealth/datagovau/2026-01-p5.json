This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 8 May to 6 June 2012. Overall, 87,214 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 55%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2012 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2012 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n* 2012 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2012 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au.

    "description": "Electricity consumption benchmarks – Survey responses matched with household consumption data for 25 households \r\n\r\nThe AER is required to update electricity consumption benchmarks (available on www.energymadeeasy.gov.au) at least every three years. The benchmarks were initially developed in 2011. The update of the benchmarks is currently being undertaken, and this is a small subset of the data. Once the study is finalised, the whole dataset will be made available via www.data.gov.au.  \r\n\r\nThis data is made up of two elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tResponses to a survey from 25 Victorian householders about their energy consumption (shown in the tab ‘questionnaire responses’).\r\n\r\n2.\tEnergy consumption data (in Watt Hours (WH)) for each household in the sample from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2014 (or such time as data are available after the installation of a smart meter). E_0000_WH refers to WH usage in the half hour commencing 12am. The column TYPE shows the type of usage. There are three types – general, controlled load (where the household has a dedicated circuit for a specific appliance, such as hot water) and generation (where the household has solar panels, this shows the WH exported to the grid from the solar panels - note that electricity generated and used within the house is not measured). \r\n\r\nThere is also a word document titled ‘questionnaire’, which shows the survey questions. The corresponding question number in the spreadsheet shows the data for that question. \r\n",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises mapping associated with the State Planning Policy 2.4 Basic Raw Materials (BRM). Extraction Sites comprise all commercial extraction areas for BRM and those BRM quarries used by government for infrastructure. Extraction Sites include operating, approved and proposed commercial (extractive) industries under the Planning and Development Act 2005, the Local Government Act 1995, the Mining Act 1978 or a combination of these legislations. They may occur wholly or partly within or outside of Significant Geological Supplies areas. Where they occur outside of Significant Geological Supplies they provide important local supplies and in some cases provide for a specific market niche over the short to medium term. Currently, this dataset only shows those Extraction Sites that lie within the Perth and Peel Regions and that were identified by an extensive interagency BRM planning process, which included public consultation in 2015 and 2016. Within the Perth and Peel Regions, Extraction Sites include those that have Prior State Environment Minister approval. For practical reasons, it is not intended for this mapping to include all Extraction Sites, as these are administered by different agencies and in some cases can change within a short timeframe. However, the intent is for the State Planning Policy 2.4 to be applied to all Extraction Sites irrespective of whether they are shown in this mapping.",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R0.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, October 21, 2011\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, October, 2011\n\nData was collected from 25th-26th of October.\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) indicators by area. The data spans the year of 2011 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity)\n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility.\nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Route Segment (Polyline) 2011\".\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nReceptor impact models (RIMs) are developed for specific landscape classes. The prediction of Receptor Impact Variables is a multi-stage process.  It relies on the runs from surface water and groundwater models at nodes within the analysis extent. These outputs derive directly from the hydrological model. For a given node, there is a value for each combination of hydrological response variable, future, and replicate or run number. Not all variables may be available or appropriate at every node. This differs to the quantile summary information that is otherwise used to summarise the HRV output and is also registered.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThere is a key look up table (Excel file) that lists the assessment units (AUIDs) by landscape class (or landscape group if appropriate) and notes that groundwater modelling node and runs, and the surface water modelling node and runs, that should be used for that AUID.  In some cases the AUID is only mapped to one set of hydrological modelling output. This look up table represent the AUIDs that require RIV predictions. For NAM and GAL there is a single look up table. For GLO and HUN surface and GW are provided separately. \n\nReceptor impact models (RIMs) are developed for specific landscape classes.  The hydrological response variables that a RIM within a landscape class requires are organised by the R script RIM_Prediction_CreateArray.R into an array.  The formatted data is available as an R data file format called RDS and can be read directly into R.\n\nThe R script IMIA_HUN_RIM_predictions.R applies the receptor model functions (RDS object as part of Data set 1: Ecological expert elicitation and receptor impact models for the HUN subregion) to the HRV array for each landscape class (or landscape group) to make predictions of receptor impact varibles (RIVs). Predictions of a receptor impact from a RIM for a landscape class are summarised at relevant AUIDs by the 5th through to the 95th percentiles (in 5% increments) for baseline and CRDP futures. These are available in the  HUN_RIV_quantiles_IMIA.csv data set. RIV predictions are further summarised and compared as boxplots (using the R script boxplotsbyfutureperiod.R) and as (aggregated) spatial risk maps using GIS.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2018) HUN Predictions of receptor impact variables v01.

    "description": "The Australian Bluewater Observing System (ABOS) Facility provides the coordination of national efforts in the sustained observation of open ocean properties with particular emphasis on observations important to climate and carbon cycle studies.  The major areas of research driving the facility include:\n* tracking multi-decadal ocean change and predicting regional and marine impacts;\n* understanding the modes and drivers of climate variability in the Australian region;\n* improved understanding and prediction of ocean currents; and\n* discovering the links between ocean and climate variability, marine chemical cycling and ecosystem structure and function at various time scales.\n\nABOS observations are primarily obtained from moorings specially designed for each site. Autonomous profiling floats and gliders have also been deployed at the Southern Ocean sites to obtain complementary data. Operation of the facility is spread between three sub-facilities.\n\n1) The Air-Sea Flux Stations (ASFS) sub-facility focuses on marine meteorology and delivers measurements which are necessary for computing air-sea fluxes of heat, momentum and mass with the option to measure surface photosynthetically active radiation and surface UV to help assess light available for phytoplankton production.\n\n2) Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) provides high temporal resolution measurements of physical, chemical and biogeochemical parameters in sub-Antarctic waters. The emphasis is on inter-annual variations of upper ocean properties and their influence on exchange with the deep ocean. \n\n3) Deepwater Arrays (DA) includes observational programs based on moored conductivity-temperature-depth sensors and current meter arrays in deep waters that are specifically targeted to monitor formation of Antarctic Bottom Water, inter-basin exchange and major boundary currents. The Deepwater array sites include: \na) Polynya Array - the Adelie Land Coast deep shelf to observe outflows of newly forming Antarctic Bottom water, \nb) Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) Array - Timor Passage and Ombai Strait, to monitor the inter-basin Indian-Pacific Ocean exchange and the upper limb of the global overturning circulation, \nc) East Australian Current (EAC) Array - east coast of Australia, near Brisbane, to monitor EAC transport.",

    "description": "\"The ‘1:2 500 000 major crustal boundaries of Western Australia, 2021’ digital layer is a regional compilation of interpreted crustal\nboundaries that penetrate the lithosphere or bound tectonic units at the terrane or province scale. These boundaries have been interpreted and extrapolated from a variety of geological and geophysical datasets, primarily seismic reflection profiles, outcrop geology, and potential field data (gravity and aeromagnetics). Tectonic events ascribed to each boundary are defined in the GSWA Explanatory Notes Database (February 2021). The positional accuracy of these boundaries is low, due primarily to their crustal scale and uncertainties in interpreting the primary data sources, and consequently this map is best used at the nominal scale or smaller. \"",

    "description": "An International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis, produced daily on an operational basis at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology using optimal interpolation (OI) on a regional 1/12 degree grid over the Australian region (20N - 70S, 60E - 170W). This Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA) v1.0 system blends infra-red SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA and METOP polar-orbiting satellites, microwave SST observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2) on GCOM-W, and in situ data from ships, and drifting and moored buoys from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS).  \n\nAll SST observations are filtered for those values suspected to be affected by diurnal warming by excluding cases which have experienced recent surface wind speeds of below 6 m/s during the day and less than 2 m/s during the night, thereby resulting in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free of diurnal warming effects.",

    "description": "OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY\n\nBewsher Consulting was commissioned by Mudgee Council on 16th July 1998 to\nundertake a floodplain management study and plan for the town of Mudgee and its\nrural surrounds.\n\nMudgee is located on the banks of the Cudgegong River. The majority of the town is\nlocated on relatively high ground on the southern side of the River, with little or no\nrisk of flooding. Other parts of the town, especially to the north of the River and rural\nland upstream and downstream of the town, are located on lower lying land that is at\nrisk of flooding. A number of floods have occurred in the past, with the largest floods\nrecorded in 1955, 1956 and 1969. Lawsons Creek and Redbank Creek also\ncontribute to flooding problems experienced within the area.\n\nA flood study was recently completed for Mudgee [Department of Land and Water\nConservation, 1998]. A computer model was developed as part of the flood study,\nwhich provided information on existing flood levels and velocities for the Cudgegong\nRiver and Lawsons Creek under a range of flood events.\n\nThe current floodplain management study investigates what can be done to minimise\nthe effects of flooding. Specific objectives of the study include:\n<ul>\n<li>a review of the existing flood study model and results;</li>\n<li>additional flood modelling for Redbank Creek;</li>\n<li>quantification of the flood problem in Mudgee and rural surrounds;</li>\n<li>an assessment of potential floodplain management measures to reduce the risks\nof flooding; and</li>\n<li>the development of a recommended floodplain management plan for the Mudgee\narea outlining the best measures to reduce flood damage, based on\nconsideration of environmental, social, economic and engineering issues.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "We propose a modest program to continue monitoring 4 of the 6 known radio magnetars in order to achieve three primary science goals. The first is to characterise magnetar outbursts over long timescales, for which tracking their rotational, flux density, and polarisation properties provide a clear view of the impulse response of their magnetic fields. Second, understanding the links between magnetars the mysterious fast radio burst phenomenon through the discovery of rare emission and propagation effects, shared spectro-temporal phenomenology, and connections to high-energy (X-ray/gamma-ray) phenomena. Lastly, our continued monitoring has enormous benefit to the wider magnetar community, providing rapid alerts to changes in activity, adding context to unusual behaviour detected by high-enery observations, and a host of supplementary science through the teams extensive collaborative networks. The project and its precursors have been running since 2007 and have contributed to 21 publications since then. We are seeking to convert the project to long-term status, thereby also carrying these investigations into the SKA era.",

    "description": "This record provides the bathymetry and morphometric descriptors of the Tasmanian Seamount Cluster (TSC) developed by Berry et al. (2025).\nBathymetry was compiled from CSIRO RV Investigator and Southern Surveyor voyages utlising Kongsberg em710 and em122 multibeam echosounder systems. This was supplemented with data acquired aboard RV L’Atlante utilising a Kongsberg EM12D, during the 1994 Tasmante voyage. This supplementary bathymetry data was acquired and processed by Geoscience Australia, and resampled to allow integration with the more recent, higher resolution gridded data. Bathymetry is gridded at 30 m resolution. Morphometric descriptors were developed following the methods of Grosse (2009) to define a boundary definition layer (BDL). This layer defined 188 volcanic TSC edifices. ArcGIS Pro was then utilised to calculate associated metrics including height, volume, basal area, centroid latitude, centroid longitude, ellipticity index and irregularity index. The edifice outlines, and associated metrics, are all contained in the provided shapefile (TSC_Morphometric Parameters_2025.shp). The edifices were also grouped through unsupervised k-means clustering. The cluster number are also contained in the associated shapefile. A shapefile describing the extents of summit ridges is also provided (TSC_Summit Ridges_2025).\nIn summary, This record contains:\n•   TSC 30m Bathymetry grid\n•   TSC morphometric parameters shapefile\n•   TSC summit ridge shapefile",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "title": "Amphibians Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for November 1988. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents key results from a national survey of 1,585 recreational boat operators about their vessel biofouling management actions. The purpose was to inform a national communication approach to reducing the risk of marine pest translocation via biofouling of recreational boats in the Australian marine environment. \r\n\r\n Biofouling is a term for the growth on a boat's hull that can move invasive pests and diseases from one marine environment to another, which is a biosecurity risk. \r\n\r\n Australia's national approach to domestic marine pest biosecurity relies on voluntary uptake of the national biofouling management guidelines by recreational vessel operators, to prevent and manage biofouling growth. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The study found that a large proportion of recreational boat operators already undertake a range of effective biofouling management actions on a regular basis, with more than 60 per cent using best-practice approaches, such as regularly cleaning the boat hull and niche areas of the boat, renewing anti-fouling coatings each year and capturing biofouling waste after cleaning. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents demonstrated considerable interest in doing the right thing to protect the environment. The analysis presents opportunities to develop messaging that could be used as part of future engagement strategies with recreational boaters to influence behaviour voluntarily and promote best practice biofouling management activities.

The canopy footprints were then augmented to block, division and road polygon coverage statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate system: GDA 2020 MGA Zone 55.\n\nTemporal coverage: April 2020\n\nUpdate schedule: every 5 years\n\n\n\nTile photo by Mark Jekabsons, Trees over Gungahlin\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveat: Comparison of the ACT 2020 Canopy Cover to the 2015 is not comparable due to differences in methodology, including differences in resolution and point density, and time of year the LiDAR was captured. The 2015 data was captured in late Autumn, whereas 2020 was captured in early Autumn.",

    "description": "The purpose of the experiment was to examine the colour changes associated with the semilunar cycle in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\n1m diameter cages were constructed and stocked with 4 crabs of the species Uca capricornis. During one semilunar cycle, from one neap tide to the next, digital photographs were taken of 22 crabs (10 males, 12 females) active in the cages at approximately low tide. Photos were examined to observe any colour changes on a day to day basis. \n\nThe results show that Uca capricornis do not rythmically change their colour or pattern between moults. Although some individuals did exhibit a slight variation, by brightening or darkening existing colours, there was no apparent trend in the number of crabs either brightening or darkening with respect to the time in the cycle.",

    "description": "This dataset contains audio files for Litchfield Savanna SuperSite. Litchfield Savanna SuperSite was established in 2013 in Litchfield National Park. Site selection was influenced by the history of long-term monitoring work undertaken in this area by the Darwin Centre for Bushfire Research (formerly Bushfires NT). The core 1 ha plot is dominated by <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em> and <em>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</em>. The site is representative of the dominant ecosystem type across northern Australia: frequently burnt tropical savanna in high rainfall areas. For additional site information, see <a href=\"https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/litchfield-savanna-supersite\">Litchfield Savanna SuperSite</a>\n\n\nIn 2015 an acoustic recorder was set up on the main flux tower. In 2016 a second record was set up on mini tower N.&nbsp;5. The two recorders collected audio data for a total of 12 hours per day, split between six hours around dawn and six hours around dusk. The recording schedule aimed at capturing morning and evening bird choruses while minimizing memory and battery requirements. A long-term spectrogram has been generated for each audio file to aid in data exploration. The sensors also recorded temperature, minimum- maximum- and mean-sound pressure levels.\n\n\nData are made available through the data link.

    "description": "AusCPR: Phytoplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk. It is thus possible to see the phytoplankton cells directly on the mesh. In essence, the phytoplankton is already concentrated. Washing the phytoplankton off the silks to count in the standard manner may result in loss of or damage to cells before analysis.\nIt is advised that anyone using the data should first read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.  For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the Mallee CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the Mallee Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for grain producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Grain producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that grew at least 40 hectares of grain, oilseed or pulse crops. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n The AAGIS is funded by The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC), Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. \r\n\r\n This report was commissioned and funded by the GRDC. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income for grain producing farms is estimated to have increased by 7 per cent in 2014-15 to an average of $229 000 a farm as higher total cash receipts more than offset a small rise in total cash costs. The average rate of return was 2.8 per cent. In 2015-16 average farm cash income is estimated to have increased further to around $258 000 and the average rate of return to have increased to around 3.5 per cent. \r\n• Specialist grain farms (grain farms that obtained more than 50 per cent of their total receipts from crops sales) recorded an average farm cash income of $304 000 in 2014-15; for non-specialist farms it was about $124 000. On average, from 2000-01 to 2015-16, specialist farms recorded farm cash incomes around $125 000 higher than non-specialist farms. \r\n• The Western region recorded higher average farm incomes and rates of return than the Northern and Southern regions in 2014-15. The Western region is estimated to have again been the best performing region in 2015-16. \r\n• The cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth - at 1.8 per cent - of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity include new plant varieties, better water management and improvements in cropping equipment technology. \r\n",

    "description": "The _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights.\r\n\r\n_Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ presents information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes of ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology described in the ABARES report _Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights_ (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/AusIndigLandForestEstate_v1.0.0.pdf). The Indigenous land dataset is then combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the _Forests of Australia (2023)_ dataset. The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThe Indigenous estate land attributes are as follows:\r\n\r\n* __​Indigenous owned__: freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land or forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan\r\n* __Other special rights__: land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements, and legislated special cultural use provisions.​\r\n\r\nThe _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ dataset shows that a total of:\r\n\r\n* 154 million hectares of land in Australia (20%) is Indigenous owned, of which 24 million hectares is forest\r\n* 192 million hectares of land in Australia (25%) is under some form of Indigenous management, comprising 156 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 36 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed. Of this, 31 million hectares is forest, comprising 20.7 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 10.6 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed\r\n* 443 million hectares of land in Australia (58%) is subject to other special rights for Indigenous peoples and communities, of which 62 million hectares if forest.\r\n\r\nThese areas of land are not mutually exclusive: there is substantial overlap between Indigenous owned land, Indigenous managed or co-managed land, and land subject to other special rights. Spatial intersection of these attributes confirms the total area of land in the Indigenous estate in Australia as at 2023 was 536 million hectares (70%), and the total area of forest in the Indigenous estate as 70 million hectares, as reported in Indicator 6.4a Area of forest to which Indigenous people have use and rights that protect their special values and are recognised through formal and informal management regimes (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/criterion-6/indicator-6.4a) of _Australia’s State of the Forests Report_ (available at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr).",

A location without species mapped as present can be considered data deficient. Data sources include ACT Government surveys, consultant surveys and verified records Canberra Nature Map. Orchid and other sensitive species names and related attribution have been obfuscated to protect locations of species at risk of collection and disturbance as per the ACT Government Sensitive Ecological Spatial Data Policy (2024 in pub).\n\nUpdates: Updated quarterly with new sightings including verified records from ACT Government surveys and Canberra Nature Map <a href=\"http://canberra.naturemapr.org/\">http://canberra.naturemapr.org/.</a> The 2024 update incorporates a new methodology using an underlying ACT grid template, and implements a standardised method of generalising occurrence records to this grid (known as area of occupancy AOO).\n\nCaveat: Lack of identification a species at a site does not necessarily indicate that the plant does not occur there. It may be that appropriate survey of the site has yet to be undertaken. Even if a survey has been undertaken, the condition of habitat (or non-habitat) may have changed since the date of survey. On-ground inspection and verification of the values occurrence or non-occurrence may be necessary.\n\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors. © Australian Capital Territory",

    "description": "In response to the 2010-11 dry season, the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation updated the areas suitable/unsuitable for additional garden bores in the Perth region. Areas designated unsuitable for additional garden bores have included the following factors:\n•   salinity levels likely to be 1500 mg/L TDS or greater (in some instances\n    &gt;1000 mg/L TDS) because of proximity to river or ocean;\n•   proximity to conservation wetlands (EPP 2004, Conservation, and Resource\n    Enhancement);\n•   potential for unreliable supply to clay soils (Guildford Clay); \n•   areas of thin superficial formations underlain by Rockingham Sand and/or\n    Leederville Formation; and\n•   potential for development of acid sulphate soils.\n•   current Gnangara Mound groundwater abstraction risk map plus buffers around\n    wetlands recommended for protection in the Gnangara Sustainability Strategy.\n•   areas over allocated to existing users and where additional garden bores could\n        present a sustainability risk to the groundwater.\n\nThe boundary between suitable/unsuitable areas for additional garden bores has been plotted according to the above factors and then modified to best fit of property boundaries and roads.\n\nIt is recommended the data be used at or above a scale of 1:10,000 for display only.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Garden Bore Suitability (DOW-061)",

    "description": "The 1:500 000 State linear structures layer (DMIRS-015) is one of three digital data layers that make up the 1:500 000 geological map of Western Australia. The other two are the 1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology (DMIRS-016) and the 1:500 000 State Cenozoic geology.\nThe linear structures layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic structures, and attribution of concealed structures refers to those that are older than the pre-Cenozoic unit in question. Compilation is based on published 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 Geological Series maps of Western Australia, together with GSWA and GA (AGSO, BMR) regional geological maps at scales from 1:250 000 to 1:1 000 000. Information from these maps has been modified locally using geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and unpublished geological mapping. Data are held in GDA decimal degrees.\n\nThis dataset was formally known as 1:500 000 State linear structures layer (DMP-012)",

A suite of overlying and adjacent Pleistocene and Holocene geological units preserving other heritage-listed ichnofossils also occur in these areas. \nAreas preserving features that are relevant to The West Kimberly National Heritage listing are subject to protection under the federal EPBC Act.\nThis dataset originates from observations and assessments performed by The University of Queensland’s Dinosaur Lab, prior to and during the DCNHMP project.\nThe DCNHMP project area is approximately 50km of the intertidal zone (the area between highest astronomical tide and lowest astronomical tide) around the town of Broome. The project area extends 15km east-southeast from Broome along the northern shore of Roebuck Bay to Crab Creek and southwest then north away from Broome along the Dampier Peninsula coastline to conclude 25km northwest of Broome at Willie Creek.\nThe DCNHMP (2025) is the product of the federal Department of Climate Change Environment Energy and Water (DCCEEW) grant funding. \nThis dataset is one of three datasets produced by the DCNHMP.

    "description": "This data set provides mobile (cellular) network performance, allocated to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) boundaries from the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).\nAdditional columns have been added corresponding to the matching boundaries of the 2016 ABS Statistical Area Levels 2, 3 and 4, and the 2020 Local Government Areas. These were spatially joined using the centroid of each polygon, and therefore, should only be used as an approximation. Furthermore, grid cells residing outside of these boundaries, such as offshore or over rivers, are assigned a null value in these columns.",

    "description": "The Home Equity Access Scheme (the Scheme) is a voluntary arrangement that allows people of Age Pension age to supplement their retirement income through an Australian Government loan secured against their home or other suitable Australian real estate. Other qualification criteria apply, including residency. Participants can access regular fortnightly payments, capped lump sum advance payments, or both.\r\n \r\nFortnightly loan payments can ‘top up’ any pension payment the person receives to a maximum of 150 per cent of the maximum fortnightly rate of Age Pension. For example, a maximum-rate age pensioner can receive an extra 50 per cent of the pension as a Scheme loan, a non-pensioner can receive the full 150 per cent of the maximum Age Pension rate, and a part pensioner can receive an amount in between. Participants can also access up to two lump sum advances in any 26-fortnight period, to a combined total of no more than 50 per cent of the maximum annual rate of Age Pension. Any lump sum advance will reduce the maximum fortnightly loan amount a participant can receive over the subsequent 26-fortnight period.\r\n \r\nA Scheme loan accrues compound interest. Any amount received under the Scheme, and interest accrued, is attributed as a debt secured against real assets nominated by the participant. Voluntary repayments can be made at any time but are not required. Any outstanding amount is recovered on the sale of the secured real estate (unless rolled over to a new property) or from the person’s estate. A No Negative Equity Guarantee limits the recoverable debt to the equity in the property used to secure the loan.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Scheme, please visit the Department of Social Services' website at: https://www.dss.gov.au/home-equity-access-scheme",

This record contains 3 datasets. The first two contain data relating to wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure for the time periods 02/11/88-29/01/90 and 10/08/90-31/10/90. The third dataset provides cross- and long-shore wind velocities for the first sampling period between 02/11/88-29/01/90.\n\nIn these datasets samples have been averaged to provide an hourly mean. Data is presented in the 'ocean format' i.e.  \"direction going to\".\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Heritage Areas and North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "Data represents vegetation coverage within the riparian zone for waterways across Melbourne Water’s region. This layer was developed by GraceGIS as part of vegetation statistics extraction for each riparian zone and stream bed for each of the subcatchments. The data was developed as part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). The primary purpose of this layer is for reporting and target setting. This includes setting and reporting on targets and performance objectives relating to vegetation coverage.\n\n\n\nDataset was created using 1. Latest MW Drainage Network to prepare HWS stream network layer. 2. Seamless polygons were created for the stream bed: ISC 2010 streambed data and a 2 metre buffer from the network was used to develop a complete streambed layer across the Melbourne Water region. 3. Buffer polygons at 20 metres and 10 metres from the streambed representing riparian zone outside Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) area and within UGB respectively. 4. HWS Vegetation Streambed Riparian (2016) layer for these riparian and stream beds has been assembled. 5. Subc level stats are derived as detailed above.\n\n\n\nAttribute level metadata can be viewed <a href=\"https://melbournewater.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2c538ef097b64702afa908d484cbffda&amp;view=list#data\">here</a>\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "This data represents the Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia. Kwinana is a major heavy industrial area 30 km south of Perth, Western Australia. Most industry is concentrated in a strip of land about eight kilometres long bordering the Indian Ocean.\nIn the late 1970s emissions of sulfur dioxide from Kwinana industries caused significant pollution in nearby residential areas. The almost universal conversion to natural gas in 1984 virtually eliminated sulfur dioxide emissions associated with fuel combustion. However, with growth in demand and the cost of natural gas, plus the increase in sulfur dioxide emissions from other sources, the Environmental Protection Authority recognised the potential for the air quality around Kwinana to again become degraded and therefore established an Environmental Protection Policy (EPP) in 1992 to maintain acceptable air quality.\n\nThe Kwinana EPP was formally reviewed in 1999 and re-issued unchanged. The 1992 Regulations are still in force along with a 1999 amendment regulations. The EPP provides for a redetermination of industrial emissions limits as and when required, e.g. to accommodate new industries or variations to existing industry emissions.\n\nThe Policy defines three areas (Areas A, B and C), where:\nArea A is the area of land on which heavy industry is located;\nArea B is a buffer area surrounding industry;\nArea C is beyond Areas A and B, predominantly rural and residential.\n\nSulfur dioxide standards and limits were set for the three areas, increasing in stringency from Area A to Area C. The most important of these with respect to controlling air quality are the standards and limits averaged over 1-hour. Similarly, ambient standards and limits were established for total suspended particulates.",

    "description": "The importance of the Rum Jungle deposits required a geological survey of the surrounding district to determine whether or not additional deposits were to be found. None have been found as a result of the work so far completed. This work is also intended to contribute to a larger scale compilation of the regional geology of the Northern Territory. The rocks of the area include metasediments (some of which are tuffaceous) which are intruded by granite, quartz and quartz-tourmaline veins and dolerite dykes. The metasediments are assigned to the Brock's Creek Group of Lower Proterozoic age, (Noakes, 1949). The original sediments were deposited in a shallow-water geosynclinal environment close to a granitic (?) land-mass. Granites intruded the sediments towards the close of geosynclinal development. Diastrophism, which extended over a wide area, caused strong folding, brecciation, possible thrust-faulting and transcurrent faulting close to the granites. Gold, copper, and uranium have been found and mined in the area. The gold is associated with quartz and quartz-tourmaline veins. The genesis of the copper and uranium deposits has not been satisfactorily determined. Only uranium and associated copper are being mined today.",

    "description": "Twice a year we carry out walking count surveys to give us a picture of walking trends across the local area. The counts take place at around 100 locations from 6am to midnight in fair weather conditions, on a weekday and a day on the weekend in March and October. The survey locations were selected based on the Liveable Green Network, such as locations of interest or where change is occurring or expected.  View this dataset in our walking counts app.  For more information on walking counts, visit the City of Sydney website.",

    "description": "    \n\nThe Australian Terrestrial Biodiversity Assessment (NLWRA, 2002) is the first\nattempt to report on terrestrial biodiversity condition and trend across\nAustralia aggregated from point and subregion or bioregion data. The\nassessment includes condition and trend of wetlands, riparian zones,\nthreatened species and ecosystems and the processes that threaten various\nelements of biodiversity. The assessment also includes biodiversity\nconservation opportunities in protected area consolidation, threatened species\nand ecosystem management, and conservation across the wider landscape. This\napplication includes a national database (bs_data.mdb) compiled from State and\nTerritory data supplied to the National Land and Water Resources Audit, and a\ndata entry tool (bs_gui.mdb) which allows data entry, editing and reporting. A\ndatabase design specification document is also included.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_badesr9nn\n__02211a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "We propose to carry out the most ambitious and comprehensive all-sky survey for pulsars and transient sources to date. Using the 20cm multibeam and a new digital filterbank array this survey will create a petabyte digital record of the sky that can be data mined in the future and used to search for relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars, RRATs, and extragalactic radio bursts. The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2017.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "CAUTION: NVIS datasets are large and computationally intensive! Please allow sufficient time to plan and execute any geoprocessing of NVIS datasets.\n\nThis dataset is a vector layer delineating the extant ('present') native vegetation types across Australia made available for release under CC BY. This dataset is part of a larger compilation of Australian states and territories for the latest release (Version 5.1) of the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS). Each state/territory is available for separate download, due to size limitations.\n\nThis dataset comprises part of NVIS Version 5.0. This dataset was also used to develop previous Major Vegetation Groups and Subgroup products (version 3.0 to present). Note that the interpretation of vegetation descriptions (i.e. in the lookup table) may differ between versions. \n\nThe comparable estimated Pre-1750 ('pre-clearing', 'pre-European') vegetation are in the following separate dataset(s):\nNVIS5_1_AUST_PRE_\n\nFeature classes are named - NVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_ or NVIS5_1_AUST_PRE_ .\n\nTo use this dataset and display the Level 1-6 hierarchy  the field \"NVISDSC1\" must be joined to the field \"NVIS_ID\" in the lookup table, available for separate:\nNVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_DETAILn > where n is an integer incremented with minor updates - see metadata for this table for instructions.\n\nOnce this table has been joined, a simple display option is to use the field \"MVG_NAME\" which includes the names of the NVIS Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs) as described at: http://www.environment.gov.au/land/publications/factsheets-vegetation-profiles-major-vegetation-groups. The most detailed account of the pre-clearing vegetation is in the field L6_SUB_ASSOCIATION following the NVIS scheme.\n[A legend or 'shadesets' for the MVGs and MVSs can be found \n\nFor internal users - N:\\Veg\\NVIS_V5_1_\\MVG_MVS\\Symbology\\Vector\n\nFor external users - in this package: \n- MVG5_1_BY_NAME.lyr\n- MVG5_1_BY_NUMBER.lyr\n- MVS5_1_BY_NAME.lyr\n- MVS5_1_BY_NUMBER.lyr\nUse the field “MVG_NUMBER/MVS_NUMBER” or “MVG_NAME/MVS_NAME” for the symbology.]\n\nThe NVIS vegetation attributes contain information on vegetation structure (growth form, height and cover) and floristics (genus and species) as documented in the Australian Native Vegetation Assessment (NLWRA, 2001) and the Australian Vegetation Attribute Manual Version 7.0 (NVIS Technical Working Group, 2017). Levels 1 to 6 of the NVIS Information Hierarchy are present in this dataset, where provided by the custodian.\n\nAttribute data for the above datasets marked \"Level 6\" were supplied in the XML Transfer System, which checks for consistency throughout the NVIS Information Hierarchy (NVIS Technical Working Group, 2017). Attribute data was loaded into an Oracle database at ERIN, where each vegetation type in the source data was allocated a unique NVIS identifier (NVIS_ID). Some attribute data, principally that coming from the Native Vegetation Mapping Program (NVMP), met the standard NVIS quality assurance tests.\n\nThe spatial data were supplied with SOURCE_CODEs, which were converted to NVIS identifiers (NVISDSC1-6). Please note that vegetation mapping can be quite complex and a single polygon may contain a \"mosaic\" of up to six vegetation associations. Other NVIS attributes were also updated on the basis of the supplied data.\n\nFor this update, Version 5.1, the extant dataset for Tasmania has been updated, with gapfilling work being completed for the NSW extant dataset. Some of the rulesets underpinning the assignment of MVGs and MVSs have also been updated to improve consistency for their allocation. Version 5.0 substantially standardised the lookup tables (NVIS5_1_LUT_DETAILxxxx and NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_FLATxxxx). For more detail refer to the associate lookup tables. Previously, Version 4.2 updated NSW. For version 4.1 most agencies supplied data to the update.\n\nThis dataset is not comparable with earlier versions of NVIS, such as the 2001 Native Vegetation Assessment (which used a different structure and vegetation typology).\n\nReference:\nNVIS Technical Working Group (2017) Australian Vegetation Attribute Manual: National Vegetation Information System, Version 7.0.

    "description": "This study summarises the available information relating to flooding in the three townships of\nMurrurundi, Blandford and Willow Tree. It describes the physical setting and flood producing\nmechanisms, identifies the flood extentand the resulting flood damages for floods of various average\nrecurrence intervals (ARI). The transport linkages, planning instruments and the eXisting flood\nemergency system are also examined. The study draws upon previous investigations including the\nMurrurundi, Blandford and Willow Tree Flood Study completed in 1997 by Lyall &amp; Macoun Consulting\nEngineers, as well as historic flood data supplied by Council.\nDetailed analysis of flood flows and levels throughout the three townships together with a survey of\nthe floor level of each building within the floodplain indicates that most of the properties affected by\nflooding are located in Murrurundi. Table S-1 summarises the numbers of properties within each\ntownship which are \"affected\" by the 100 year ARI flood. These are shown in column A and include\nproperties where flood water is on the land as well as those where flood water is above floor level.\nAlso shown, in column 0, are the numbers of properties which are \"damaged\", that is, flood water\nabove floor level.",

Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "description": "An indicative map for White Gum Moist Forest (WGMF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe determination of WGMF was reviewed by the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel), and a set of diagnostic parameters for identifying the WGMF TEC was agreed. \nOur mapping process relied upon the occurrence of E.dunnii to diagnose the presence of WGMF. \nWe reviewed existing vegetation maps, predictive models and observation records of E.dunnii to identify State Forests that are known or likely to include stands of the species. We then attempted several different approaches to sampling and mapping E.dunnii using ground based surveys, predictive modelling and aerial photograph interpretation (API). We used API assessment of known E.dunnii stands to identify image patterns and signatures that indicated the presence of E.dunnii. We used our findings to examine un-surveyed areas of relevant state forests via API, and then we mapped any areas which appeared to be dominated or co-dominated by E.dunnii. We also developed a Random Forest presence-absence model and used it to predict the distribution of WGMF across its range.\nWe constructed an indicative map of WGMF using the combined results of our API mapping and our predictive model. In total, we mapped approximately 980 hectares of forest likely to be dominated or co-dominated by E.dunnii across 16 State Forests. Two thirds of the mapped area is associated with the northern populations of E.dunnii – the largest areas were in Beaury, Donaldson and Yabbra State Forests. In the southern area, Kangaroo River State Forest includes the largest representation of E.dunnii in State Forest. \nOur conclusions from this exercise is that our API interpretation is capable of separating E.dunnii from other related eucalypts but only where it is supported by field reconnaissance. Therefore, further work is required to increase API confidence throughout its range before our maps are suitable for operational applications. Nonetheless, our indicative map is still useful for providing a list of State Forests that include mapped areas of E.dunnii and identifying the areas that have corroborating field based evidence of E.dunnii.\nAs our indicative map stands at present, we consider that it overestimates the extent of E.dunnii and its dominance, however, it is unlikely that extensive stands exist outside our mapped areas. We also conclude that existing mapping (including both forest type mapping and OEH (2012) mapping) significantly underestimates the likely true extent).\nIndicative TEC Mapping have been generated from best available composite environmental data layers - standardised to 30 m pixels.",

The notices were placed by relatives and friends of World War I service personnel who died, or were wounded, or were decorated. Some newspaper printing errors have been corrected using official sources.\nThis is a subset of the Heroes of the Great War data limited to those entries (3062) that contain a portrait. \nData set also includes the reference (date, page and column) within The Chronicle, brief biographical details including name, age, rank, battalion and occasionally place of death. Also included are names of relatives and place of residence in South Australia by street address, suburb or town.\nFor the full data set, see Heroes of the Great War Chronicle Newspaper 1915-1919.",

These boundaries generally align with the defined Local Land Services Regions 2013, with areas in the northern inland, central eastern, central western, central southern parts of the state combined into specific BCT Regions. Deviations from the Western Division dataset occur at Walgett, Bogan and Balranald LGAs and from the LGA dataset at Hilltops, Carrathool, Hay and Bogan. Northern Tablelands and North West Local Land Services Region areas combined into Northern Inland; Hunter and Greater Sydney Local Land Services Region areas combined into Sydney-Hunter; Central Tablelands and Central West combined into Central West: Riverina and Murray combined into Murray-Riverina; South East region maintaining LLS boundary (before LGAs were combined into Hilltops).\nCredits",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "This data was collected in February/March 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1112V4.\n\nDeparted: \tFremantle, Western Australia,  February 15, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  March 15, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "title": "Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (AHGF) (Geofabric) V3x",
    "description": "The AHGF: Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) is a specialised\r\nGeographic Information System (GIS). It identifies the spatial relationships\r\nof important hydrological features such as rivers, catchments, waterbodies, aquifers\r\ncanals and monitoring points.\r\n\r\nBy detailing the spatial dimensions of these hydrology features and how they are connected, it is possible to analyse how water flows, is stored, transported and used through the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe enduring nature of the Geofabric is based on a set of contracted nodes (points) which represent important hydrological features in the landscape. A subset of the contracted nodes is used to create a simplified node-link network with associated contracted catchments. There is also a hierarchy of catchments, as well as alternate representations to meet varied user requirements and a toolset that supports customisation.\r\n\r\nThe Geofabric includes 6 products;\r\nSurface Hydrology Network\r\nSurface Hydrology Cartography\r\nSurface Hydrology Catchments\r\nHydrology Reporting Catchments\r\nHydrology Reporting Regions\r\nGroundwater Cartography\r\n\r\n\r\nSurface Hydrology Network product:\r\n\r\nNetwork representation of hydrological features, including over 2.5 million stream segments and 6000 gauging stations, with the ability to trace the drainage the network both upstream and downstream and identify contributing catchment areas. Can also be used with the Geofabric Toolset to create customised catchments and networks.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hydrology Network product provides a set of related feature classes to be used as the basis for production of consistent hydrological surface stream network analysis. This product contains a topographically consistent representation of the (major) surface water features of Australia (excluding external territories). Contains six datasets: Waterbody, Network Stream, Network Node, Catchment, Network Connectivity (Upstream) and Network Connectivity (Downstream).\r\n\r\n\r\nSurface Hydrology Cartography product:\r\n\r\nCartographic representation of surface hydrological features, based on best available mapped features, approximating 1:100,000 scale, for contextual purposes and production of consistent hydrological cartographic maps.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hydrology Cartography product contains a geometric representation of the (major) surface water features of Australia (excluding external territories). Primarily, these are natural surface hydrology features but the product also contains some man-made features (notably reservoirs, canals and other hydrographic features. Contains thirteen datasets: Waterbody, Mapped Stream, Mapped Node, Dam, Structure, Canal Line, Monitoring Point, Water Pipeline, Hydro Point, Hydro Line, Hydro Area, Mapped Connectivity (Upstream) and Mapped Connectivity (Downstream).\r\n\r\n\r\nSurface Hydrology Catchment product:\r\n\r\nNational catchment boundaries (NCB) derived from the 1 second Digital Elevation Model using ANUDEM, with approximately 7 million base level catchments, designed to represent geographic catchment boundaries that have a hydrological relationship to surface water features.\r\n\r\nThe Surface Hydrology Catchments product provides a hierarchy of catchments, with base AHGFCatchment defining a catchment for every stream segment contained within the Geofabric Surface Network along coastal draining and sink basins. ANUDEM processing provided an additional 2 AHGFCatchment aggregated features, these being NCB Level 2 Drainage Basin Group and NCB Level 1 Drainage Division. These 2 aggregate layers are somewhat superseded by Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions; River Region and AWRA Drainage Division. Contains three datasets: Catchments, NCB level 1 Drainage Division and NCB Level 2 Drainage Basin Group.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrology Reporting Catchment product:\r\n\r\nGeofabric Hydrology Reporting Catchments comprises two related views of hydrological catchments to be used for modelling, analysis and reporting purposes. Firstly, a topological network view of hydrological catchments represented as a simplified node-link network using a subset of the contracted nodes (AHGFNode) and the links (AHGFLink) between them; and secondly, a catchments view of the hydrology using the contracted catchments (AHGFContractedCatchment).\r\n\r\nThe AHGFNode feature class contains contracted nodes that are points of hydrological significance that carry identity. They include the confluence of major named streams, coastal stream termini, waterbody inflow and outflows, important gauging stations and inland sinks. The AHGFLink feature class provides the topological connectors between a subset of contracted nodes that participate in the simplified node-link network. The AHGFContractedCatchment feature class contains catchment polygons for the subset of contracted nodes that participate in the simplified node link network. These catchments are part of a hierarchy that can be aggregated and traced based on upstream relationships. Contains five datasets: Node, Link, Contracted Catchment, Node-Link Connectivity (upstream), and Node-Link Connectivity (downstream).\r\n\r\n\r\nGeofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions product:\r\n\r\nReporting regions based on aggregations of contracted catchments, similar to 1997 Australian Water Resource Council (AWRC) Drainage Division and River Basin boundaries, as well as important Gauging Station contributing catchments, for provision of a stable set of reporting boundaries at both the national and regional scale.\r\n\r\nIt contains three levels of hydrological reporting regions. The first delineates national level drainage divisions, the second delineates regional level river regions across Australia and the third important Gauging Station catchments that represent upstream contributing catchments, which are also used in hydrological modelling. Contains five datasets: AWRA Drainage Division, AWRA Drainage Division Contracted Catchment Lookup, River Region, River Regions Contracted Catchment and Station Catchments.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroundwater Cartography product:\r\n\r\nGroundwater Cartography is a national collation of existing groundwater mapping including aquifer boundaries and properties (structure contours, salinity, outcrop and yield). It has been developed to collate and integrate state and regional groundwater mapping datasets across Australia. It provides foundation groundwater datasets essential for groundwater assessments, management, planning, modelling and research.\r\n\r\nThe data set is intended to be used at the regional to national scale and does not support local scale groundwater applications. Contains five datasets: Aquifer Boundary, Aquifer Outcrop, Aquifer Contour, Aquifer Salinity and Aquifer Yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to compile this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. This dataset contains raster datasets derived from Geoscience Australia's Barest Earth product. Outputs contained are Gozzard Ratio, Iron/Clay ratio, Sultans Formula and DPCA products.  These products provide users with information regarding the makeup of outcropping geology and regolith in the Beetaloo GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nRaster analysis was carried out in ESRI's ArcGIS software.  Gozzard ratio, developed by Tapley and Gozzard, has been applied to the parent dataset and is used to provide finer subdivision in areas where iron and clay are important components of the regolith.  Iron Clay ratio was applied to the parent dataset and is used to differentiate between different types of iron and clay.  The Sultan's formula was applied to the parent dataset and is used to highlight ultramafic rocks in arid terrain (Sultan et al., 1987), and is broadly applicable to mapping geological features.  DPCA is the Directed Principle Components Analysis has been applied to the parent dataset.  The DPCA formula applied was developed by Fraser and Green.",

This specific dataset presents statistics on affordable 1 bedroom rental properties by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nAffordable rental properties are those within 30 per cent of gross income for low-income households. The rental thresholds are taken from the household incomes for whom that number of bedrooms is a minimum: \n\n\nFor one-bedroom properties, we have taken the income of singles on Newstart allowance;\n\n\nFor two-bedroom properties, we have taken a single parent pensioner with one child aged under 5;\n\n\nFor three-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with two children;\n\n\nFor four-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with four children.\n\n\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",
