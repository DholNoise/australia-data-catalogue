    "title": "Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan Report Cessnock City (Black Creek) - Report",
    "description": "Cessnock City Council has engaged Cardno (NSW/ACT) Pty Ltd to prepare the Black Creek Floodplain Risk Management Study and the Black Creek Floodplain Risk Management Plan in accordance with the NSW Government Floodplain Development Manual (NSW Government, 2005). Flooding in the catchment can pose a hazard to residents and businesses near the creeks, channels and overland flow paths.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify and examine options for the management of flooding within the Black Creek catchment.\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to document a strategy of suitable actions for implementation. The Black Creek catchment is located within the Cessnock Local Government Area (LGA) and comprises all urban areas including the Cessnock Central Business District (CBD) and surrounding suburbs. Black Creek has several tributaries, including Bellbird Creek, Lavender Creek, Limestone Creek, Kearsley Creek and Aberdare Creek. Other tributaries include the Oliver Street channel in South Cessnock and the East Cessnock Drain. These tributaries flow through rural areas towards Cessnock and generally comprise concrete lined trapezoidal channels in the urban areas. Given the numerous creeks converging in Cessnock, flooding has occurred regularly including in 1949, 1977, 1990, 1992 and 2007.\n\nAs part of this study, the existing hydrological and hydraulic models developed as part of the Black Creek Flood Study (DHI, 2010) were extended to include areas outside of the Cessnock CBD where limited information on flooding behaviour existed including Bellbird, Mount View detention basin and surrounds and northeast of the CBD. Up-to-date ground survey information was collected in 2011 and was used to represent the terrain in the hydraulic model. Flood modelling was undertaken for seven design storm events ranging from the 20% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) event up to the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event in order to assess flood behaviour in the extended hydraulic model.\n\nA number of key differences from the DHI (2010) study resulted from the extension of the hydraulic model and incorporation of up-to-date survey information including a reduction in 1% AEP flood levels ranging from 0.2m to 0.5m along Bellbird Creek and a reduction in flood levels of 0.2m along East Cessnock Drain. The updated hydraulic model provides detailed information on flood behaviour and overland flow paths in the vicinity of Mount View detention basin and through the urban areas of Cessnock. The revised flood extents were adopted by Council in March 2014.\n\nAn assessment was undertaken on the number of properties that would be subject to overground and overfloor flooding within the floodplain under various design storm events ranging from the 20% AEP event up to the PMF.  \n\nOptions to reduce or manage the effects of flooding in the catchment were investigated to manage the risks of flooding. Under the merits-based approach outlined in the NSW State Government’s Floodplain Development Manual (NSW Government, 2005) a number of potential options for the management of flooding were identified, namely:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFlood modification measures (FM Options);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nProperty modification measures (P Options); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nEmergency response modification measures (EM Options).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nAn extensive list of options was assessed against a range of criteria (technical, economic, environmental and social) and hydraulic modelling of some of the flood mitigation options was undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of those options that would involve significant capital expenditure.\n\nThe highest ranking options identified by the multi criteria analysis include:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFM5, proposed bund/flood wall east of Sixth Street properties and railway line in South Cessnock;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nEM4, Public awareness and education;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nEM5, Flood warning signs at critical locations;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nP6, Land Swap;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nP3, House Raising; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nP4, House Rebuilding;\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nA number of structural options assessed were not considered viable either due to:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nadverse impacts on flood levels such as Option FM2 (A combination of a detention basin, a bund and channel reshaping along Bellbird Creek); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nwhere the cost benefit ratio indicated the cost of implementing the option were much higher than the resultant reduction in flood damages, including:\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM1 (Combination of detention basins along Black Creek);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM3 (A combination of channel widening, channel reshaping and culvert upgrades on Black Creek);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM4 (Channel widening of the existing Oliver Street channel at South Cessnock); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM6 (Detention Basin at Austar Coal Mine Site on Bellbird Creek upstream).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe ranking is used as the basis for prioritising the components of the Floodplain Risk Management Plan  It is noted that scoring adopted is not absolute and the proposed scoring and weightings used should be reviewed in future.\n\nThe Floodplain Risk Management Plan (Chapter 15) represents the proposed implementation plan of actions for the management of flood risks in the Black Creek Floodplain. The action list contains a mix of approaches to managing flood risks with a priority system of high, medium and low for implementation of the actions.",

    "description": "Fiddler crabs are often spectacularly coloured and capable of dramatic colour changes. While the adaptive significance of variation resulting from short- or long-term colour changes is generally well known, the phenotypic diversity in colour pattern between individuals is often neglected. To fully understand the development and function of colour pattern variation, it is necessary to first describe its morphological basis and the naturally occurring diversity. - NB Colour pattern refers to the configuration of any coloured areas on the black carapace, regardless of their spectral composition. \n\nDuring this experiment 276 fiddler crabs of the species Uca capricornis were photographed - 117 females and 159 males. Using these pictures and a host of software programs, images were constructed that illustrate the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs, including males and females in general, and males and females with various size classes; <8mm, 8-9.9mm, 10-11.9mm, 12-13.9mm, 14-15.9mm, 16-17.9mm, and males >18mm (no photographed females were >18mm).   These images are the equivalent of an average crab's colour pattern. \n\nTo more clearly illustrate the variation in colour pattern between the groups, similar images were constructed using the standard deviation of crabs coloured at each coordinate (1mm x 1mm square).",

    "title": "ACNC 2015 Annual Information Statement Data",
    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2015 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for a charity’s 2015 reporting year. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2014 – 30 June 2015, for others it will be the 2015 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2015 reporting period. \r\n\r\nSome charities report to the ACNC as part of a reporting group. The 2015 AIS information for these charities is attached as a separate dataset on this page. Any analysis of AIS data should include those charities as well.  \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS collects information about charity finances. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a network of researchers who are interested in the sector, and hold regular teleconferences. If you are interested in becoming involved in the Research network, please [email us](research@acnc.gov.au). The ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "\nThis layer contains information on the distribution and vegetation types of High Country Sphagnum Bogs and Fens in the ACT as defined by Nature Conservation (High Country Bogs and Associated Fens) Conservation Advice 2019 (Nature Conservation Act). The dataset includes areas of RAMSAR significance. The threatened Northern Corroboree Frogs are also associated with these ecosystems. Veg mapping was undertaken by Geoff Hope et al in 2009 and later revisited during mapping of ACT Vegetation Communities in 2015-2018 (Baines et al 2018).\nThe ACT Scientific Committee determined that the ecological community High Country Bogs and Associated Fens is eligible for inclusion in the ACT Threatened Ecological Communities List in 2019. Most ACT High Country Bogs and Associated Fens communities are consistent with the nationally listed Alpine Sphagnum Bogs and Associated Fens ecological community.\nThe mountains of the Australian Capital Territory support substantial areas of peat-forming mires in interfluves and valley heads, as well as areas of riparian fen vegetation along streams. While similar fens and bogs occur in the Snowy Mountains, the ACT represents a significant outlier of major biogeographic significance because the mires are near their climatic limits and hence sensitive to climate change.\nMapping of the mires was originally completed by Hope et al 2009. The mapping was developed in three stages using orthorectified aerial photography and satellite imagery and extensive field checking. More information can be found at: Hope, G., Nanson, R. and Flett, I. 2009. Technical Report 19. The peat-forming mires of the Australian Capital Territory. Territory and Municipal Services, Canberra. <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2539595/19-peat-forming-mires-of-the-act-2009.pdf\">https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2539595/19-peat-forming-mires-of-the-act-2009.pdf</a>\nKey plant communities of ACT Bogs and Fens (Armstrong et al. 2012):\n•   a2: Baeckea gunniana – Epacris paludosa – Richea continentis – Sphagnum cristatum Wet Heathland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Bog).\n•   a7: Ranunculus pimpinellifolius – Gonocarpus micranthus herbfield of wetland heathland of the Australian Alps bioregion (Bog).\n• a8: Carex gaudichaudiana – Myriophyllum pedunculatum – Deschampsia caespitosa Sedgeland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Fen).\n•   a9: Carex gaudichaudiana – Ranunculus amphitrichus – Phragmites australis Aquatic Herbfield of waterways in the Australian Alps and South-Eastern Highlands Bioregion (Montane Bogs and Fens).\nOther key plant communities (Hope et al. 2009):\n•   Empodisma minus restiad Fen.\n•   Phragmites – Typha tall sedgelands (Fen).\nAssociated plant communities (Armstrong et al. 2012):\n•  a14: Poa costiniana – Carex gaudichaudiana Subalpine Valley Grassland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Grasslands/Herbfields).\n•   e59: Hakea microcarpa – Baeckea utilis – Leptospermum myrtifolium Subalpine Wet Heathland on Escarpment and Eastern Tableland Ranges of the South-Eastern Highlands Bioregion.\n• u193: Hakea microcarpa – Epacris breviflora – Epacris paludosa Montane Wet Heathland of the Australian Alps and western South-Eastern Highlands Bioregions.\nNote this product includes some areas of a33 vegetation community, which is formally considered to be associated with the threatened community (see ACT High Country Bogs and Fens Action Plan 2024, ACT Government). However, these areas were originally mapped by Hope et al 2009 with high altitude sphagnum bog (HSB) present.\nFor more information on ACT High Country Bogs and Fens, visit <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens</a>\nUpdates: Majority of the mapping was completed post 2003 fires. However, the dataset is was updated using Near Infrared Imagery 2015 and LiDAR data in 2019. Further updates will be implemented as required if new or better mapping of bog and fen areas become available.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:3,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for showing presence of bogs and fens in the ACT. Exact boundaries and extents will contract and expand throughout time. This should be considered if data use purpose requires accuracy of greater than 50m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors. © ACT Government",

The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

    "title": "Native Bees Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "title": "Seagrass proliferation precedes mortality during hypo-salinity events: a stress-induced morphometric response (NERP TE 5.3, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of one data file from a 10 week aquarium experiment manipulating salinity and measuring density, reproduction and growth responses of three tropical Indo-pacific seagrass species (Zostera mueller, Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis). \n\nHalophytes, such as seagrasses, predominantly form habitats in coastal and estuarine areas. These habitats can be seasonally exposed to hypo-salinity events during watershed runoff exposing them to dramatic salinity shifts and osmotic shock. The manifestation of this osmotic shock on seagrass morphology and phenology was tested.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nHypo-salinity exposure experiments were conducted on three species of seagrass, which are ubiquitous throughout the Indo-Pacific, except Zostera muelleri Irmisch ex Ascherson, which is widespread in Australia and New Zealand only. Halodule uninervis (Forsskål) Ascherson is a tropical species that occurs throughout the Indo-West Pacific in coastal and reef habitats, while Halophila ovalis R. Brown is one of the most broadly distributed seagrass species occurring throughout the Indo-West Pacific, including temperate regions, and can be found in estuarine, reef and deepwater habitats (Waycott et al., 2004). Their habitats are periodically exposed to flood plumes of reduced salinity (Furnas, 2003). Both Z. muelleri and H. uninervis are species with linear leaf blades (blady), whereas H. ovalis has pairs of ovate leaves arising from the rhizome on petioles.\n\nZostera muelleri plants were collected from Pelican Banks, Gladstone (23º45.895¿S, 151º18.244¿E) during low tide three months before the experiments started. The plants were collected using a 10 cm corer, with sediment and rhizome and roots collected intact. The cores were placed in plastic-lined pots, the plastic bag sealed over the top of the seagrass with 2 ¿ 3 cm of water during transport to the experimental facility. Halodule uninervis and H. ovalis plants were collected from Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island (19º10.612S, 146º49.737E) using the same technique two months prior to the experiments. The plants were kept in 1000L aquaria at the Aquaculture facility in James Cook University on a closed circulation system in seawater piped from Bowling Green Bay seawater intake under a 30% light-reducing roof. \n\nThe experiment consisted of 12 salinity treatments, starting from 3 PSU and increasing by 3 PSU to 36 PSU (approximate marine seawater). Salinity treatments were obtained by diluting the seawater with de-chlorinated freshwater. Every salinity treatment consisted of four replicate tanks (65L KiTab clear plastic containers) with one pot of each species per tank (i.e. n = 4). All treatments started at 36 PSU and salinity was reduced by 25% each day over four days to the target treatment salinity to mimic the more gradual decline in salinities that occur during run-off events and to minimize potential impacts from shock osmotic changes. Throughout the experiment, salinity was measured every 1-3 days using a digital salinity/conductivity/temperature meter (YSI, model 63) and salinity was adjusted when necessary to maintain salinity within 0.5 PSU of target salinity. Plant responses to these salinities were monitored for 10 weeks. Previous salinity studies indicate that seagrass changes settle down by this time (Griffin and Durako, 2012; Koch et al., 2007), and furthermore, this experimental duration is approximately equal to or more likely exceeds the length of individual hypo-salinity events in the region.\n\nThe experiments were conducted outdoors during summer/autumn months (February to April) when high ambient temperatures occur, thus chilling units were installed to moderate temperature fluctuations within the treatment tanks throughout the experiment. There were three chilled freshwater baths (1000L tanks) that were cooled using external water chillers. Each of the 12 salinity treatments had one 60L sump (60L plastic bin) that was placed randomly in one of the 3 chilling baths, each bath containing 4 sumps. The chilled baths with sumps were held underneath tables that held the experimental tanks. From each sump, water with corresponding salinity was pumped into four replicate tanks resulting in a total of 48 tanks (4 replicate tanks x 12 sumps/salinity treatments = 48 tanks in total). Each tank contained one pot of each of the three species (48 tanks x 3 species/pots = 144 pots). Temperature was recorded every 30 mins using iBCod 22L model of iBTag¿ in six randomly selected tanks for the duration of the experiment. Water temperature was 26°C on average and ranged from 22°C to 34°C reaching these temperature extremes for short periods (1-2 h) on some days. Nitrogen (N) as NH4Cl and phosphate (P) as KH2PO4 were added to the water column at very low concentrations to increase concentrations within each system by 0.05 µMol of P and 1.0 µMol of N every 2 weeks. Nutrient concentration was measured after six weeks and was found to be 0.8 µMol (±0.2) NH3, 0.4 µMol (±0.1) NOx, and 0.2 µMol (±0.8) PO4. Average light intensity under the 30% light-reducing roof was 17 mol photons m-2 d-1 of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), measured with an Odyssey 2Pi quantum sensor (Dataflow, Odyssey photosynthetic recording system) recording every 30 mins throughout the experimental period. The tanks were periodically cleaned by syphoning out sediment and organic matter accumulating at the bottom of tanks and plants were inspected every week for signs of grazing by amphipods. Amphipods were removed to prevent an outbreak, which could lead to overgrazing of the plants. Although signs of grazing were observed at times, this cleaning regime was sufficient to avoid outbreaks.\n\nThe number of shoots in each pot for Z. muelleri and H. uninervis, or the number of leaf pairs for H. ovalis were counted prior to the experiment and then weekly during the first four weeks of the experiment and fortnightly from the sixth week up to and including the tenth week. Change in shoot density (deltaSht) was calculated as a percentage change in each week relative to pre-treatment for each individual replicate:\n              deltaSht=[(Sht tx-Sht t0 )/Sht t0 ]×100\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEq 1\nwhere deltaSht is change in shoot density, Sht tx is shoot density at time x (weeks 1 through to 10) and Sht t0 is shoot density at week zero (pre-treatment).\n\nLeaf morphometrics (width and height) of Z. muelleri, H. uninervis and H. ovalis and number of leaves per shoot for the two blady species were measured after 10 weeks at treatment salinity. These data were used to calculate foliar surface area (SA) as follows:\n                SA=shoot density × (leaves per shoot-0.5)  × leaf length × leaf width\t\tEq 2\nfor blady species (H. uninervis and Z. muelleri); and,\n                SA=leaf density × pi × ((leaf length)/2)  × ((leaf width)/2)\t\t\t\t\tEq 3\nfor the ovate species H. ovalis where: \nSA is the foliar leaf area (cm2), \nshoot density are leaves per experimental pot,\nleaves per shoot are the mean number of leaves (usually 1 to 4) per seagrass shoot and \nleaf length (cm) and leaf width (cm) of the youngest fully mature leaf. \n\nA half leaf was subtracted from the total number of leaves per shoot in calculating SA of blady species to account for one leaf on each shoot being in development and therefore not full sized (Collier et al., 2012). \n\nHalophila ovalis was the only species to flower throughout the experimental period. Flowering had commenced prior to the initiation of the experiment and continued throughout. New leaf pairs are produced in H. ovalis every 3 or 4 days at experimental water temperatures (~26 - 27°C McMahon, 2005) and H. ovalis typically had 4 to 5 leaf pairs per branch. Flowering is initiated in young leaf pairs, with more advanced reproductive structures away from the growing apex. Assuming a leaf pair production rate of 4 days, we conservatively assumed that all reproductive structures present after 4 weeks (28 d) were initiated under treatment conditions. We counted all reproductive structures (male and female flowers, as well as fruits) in each pot at weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10. \n\nLeaf growth rate was measured in week 10 on the two blady species (Z. muelleri and H. uninervis) using the leaf hole punch method (McMahon, 2005). Holes were punched using a hypodermic needle in the top of the sheath of each shoot, and after 5 ¿ 7 days we measured the distance between the mark in the sheath and the mark on the leaves. We aimed to measure up to 10 shoots per replicate pot, though the actual number measured in each pot was variable depending on shoot density and visibility of marks.\n \nFor more details see the publication:\n\nCollier, C.

    "description": "<b>Imagery Capture</b>\n\nSensor - PhaseOne IXU-RS1000 with 70mm Rodenstock reliance shutter (RS) lens. Serial Number - YC030001\nFocal Length - 69.8261mm\nImagery Type - RGB\nAcquisition Date(s) - North-South runs: 15th, 16th, 17th, 22nd &amp; 23rd July 2019 Tie/coastal strips: 22nd &amp; 23rd July 2019\nFlying Height (above MSL) - Approx 3000ft MSL for 6cm resolution, but variable due to terrain.\nCapture Methodology - Primary Runs - 95, Secondary/Tie Runs - 10\nForward / Side Overlap (%) - 70 / 40\n\n<b>Orthosmosaic</b>\n\nA digital orthophoto is a raster image of remotely sensed data in which displacement in the image due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been corrected (orthorectification). Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 6 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - &lt;3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)*\nSpatial Accuracy Notes - Based on check against selected visible survey marker coordinates (Type ‘minimark’ and ‘STAND’ with CLASS A, B, C, D) downloaded from QLDSpatial website.  Final imagery checked and accuracy verified against available cadastral data with sub 1m accuracy (B&amp;D ENTRY CONTROLLED - 0.1M, 0.25M, 0.3M, 0.5M, 1M\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - Utilised 1m Lidar DSM downloaded from https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/.  The DSM was not manually edited and no 3D  Breaklines were mapped.  In areas of disturbance or obvious terrain change eg. Mines/quarries etc, a new DSM was generated via stereo photogrammetric techniques at ½ full image resolution. The photogrammetric DSM was filtered using automated building and vegetation filter algorithms to remove some (but not all) above ground features. The filtered DSM was then gaussian smoothed and resampled to 1m resolution to match the LIDAR DTM.\nRectification Surface Accuracy Vertical - +/- 0.15m @ 67 % CI for client supplied LIDAR DTM, as per client metadata for dataset (not independently verified)\nRectification Surface Accuracy Horizontal - +/- 0.3m @ 67 % CI, as per client metadata for dataset (not verified)\nTile Size / Grid - 1km2\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Dart Point in the east, to Callala Beach(S) in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 6 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "Geographic location of the outer margin of the Antarctic ice cover for the sector between longitudes 79E and 108E, including margins of ice shelves, glaciers, and iceberg tongues.  The data set does not in general include the grounding zone at the inland margin of the ice shelves or glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe margin was defined by interpretation of an image mosaic generated from Synthetic Aperture Radar data.  The image mosaic was built using navigation data accompanying the SAR images to transform the images to a map projection. The image navigation data were adjusted so that overlapping images were registered to one another, the indivual images merged into a mosaic, and the overall process adjusted so that the mosaic was tied to the few ground control points available in this large sector.  Two separate mosaics were used to span the whole sector.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the SAR data were acquired by the ERS-SAR instruments in August 1996, some ERS data were acquired in August 1993, and one Radarsat scene was acquired in September 1997.  The data were pre-processed to produce a mosaic with a 100 m pixel size, and adjusted so that the majority of the coastline positions refer to the August 1996 epoch.\r\n\r\nThe location data are internally consistent, and extracted at nominally 200 m intervals.  The external position accuracy is generally better than 600 m. The coverage is complete over the whole sector.  The coordinate set includes some island/ice rise features.  Two very large grounded icebergs are included.\r\n\r\nData are in an ascii arc/info export file format as geographic coordinates on the ITRF1996 system and contains attribute information.\r\n\r\nERS-SAR data, copyright ESA, 1993, 1996\r\n\r\nRadarsat data, copyright Canadian Space Agency, Agence spatiale canadienne, 1997.\r\n\r\nThis work was completed as part of ASAC projects 454, 1125 and 2224 (ASAC_454, ASAC_1125 and ASAC_2224).",

    "description": "A 6m steel pole has been installed within a small bommie within Second Lagoon of One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the second lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the second lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity. The pole is available for mounting of additional third part instruments and so forms an infrastructure to support future observational work at the Island.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to map each groundwater works with the volumetric entitlement without double counting the volume and to aggregate/ disaggregate the data depending on the final use.\n\n\n\nThis has not been clipped to the CLM PAE, therefore the number of economic assets/ relevant licences will drastically reduce once this occurs. \n\n\n\nThe Clarence Moreton groundwater licences includes an extract of all licences that fell within the data management acquisition area as provided by BA to NSW Office of Water.\n\n\n\nAim: To get a one to one ratio of licences numbers to bore IDs. \n\nImportant notes about data:\n\nData has not been clipped to the PAE.\n\n\n\nClarence Moreton worksheet links the individual licence to a works and a volumetric entitlement. For most sites, this can be linked to a bore which can be found in the NGIS through the HydroID. (National_Groundwater_Information_System_v1.1_Sept2013 GUID = e157b1cd-3cb7-4cf9-a13c-a6bed576b8c7). This will allow analysis of depths, lithology and hydrostratigraphy where the data exists.\n\nWe can aggregate the data based on water source and water management zone as can be seen in the other worksheets. \n\n\n\nData available: \n\n\n\nOriginal Data: Any data that was bought in from NSW Offcie of Water, includes\n\nSpatial locations provided by NoW- This is a exported data from the submitted shape files. Includes the licence (LICENCE) numbers and the bore ID (WORK_NUO). (Refer to lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Entitlements Spatial Locations).\n\nSpreadsheet_WAL - The spread sheet from the submitted data, WLS-EXTRACT_WALs_volume. (Refer to Lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract CLM- Oct 2013)\n\nWLS_extracts - The combined spread sheets from the submitted data, WLS-EXTRACT .  (Refer to Lineage NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract CLM- Oct 2013)\n\n\n\nProcessed Data: The two final products, includes\n\nCLM_Draft - this includes cancelled licences and licences where the old licence has been replaced by a share component (essentially a repeat)\n\nCLM_final- The final working linking all licences to bore IDs, removal of cancelled licences and licences that have been replaced in the new WaterAct. Also includes the volume of the licence per works \n\nAggregated share component to water sharing plan, water source and water management zone\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nNo decision have been made in regards to what purpose of groundwater should be protected. Therefore the purpose currently includes groundwater bores that have been drilled for non-extractive purposes including experimental research, test, monitoring bore, teaching, mineral explore and groundwater explore\n\nNo volume has been included for domestic & stock as it is a basic right. Therefore an arbitrary volume could be applied to account for D&S use.\n\nLicence Number - Each sheet in the Original Data has a licence number, this is assumed to be the actual licence number. Some are old  because they have not been updated to the new WA. Some are new (From_Spreadsheet_WALs). This is the reason for the different codes.\n\nWA/CA - This number is the 'works' number. It is assumed that the number indicates the bore permit or works approval. This is why there can be multiple works to licence and licences to works number.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nProcedure: \n\n\n\n1) Original spread sheets from the licence extract ( GUID d9bd77b6-5bc3-4832-a212-0e8f5ba48076) have mulitple licence instances if there are more than one WA/CA (works) number. This means that there are more than one works or permit to the licence. The aim is to only have one licence instance. \n\n\n\n2) The individual licence numbers were combined into one column \n\n\n\n3) Using the new column of licence numbers, several vlookups were created to bring in other data. Where the columns are identical in the original spreadsheets, they are combined. The only ones that dont are the Share/Entitlement/allocation, these mean different things. \n\n\n\n4) A hydro ID column was created, this is a code that links this NSW to the NGIS, which is basically a \".1.1\" at the end of the bore code.\n\n\n\n5) All 'cancelled' licences were removed\n\n\n\n6) A count of the number of works per licence and number of bores were included in the spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n7) Where the ShareComponent = NA, the Entitlement = 0, Allocation = 0 and there was more than one instance of the same bore, this means that the original licence assigned to the bore has been replaced by a new licence with a share component. Where these criteria were met, the instances were removed\n\n\n\n8) a volume per works ensures that the volume of the licence is not repeated for each works, but is divided by the number of works\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the Bioregional assessment data conversion script for methodology.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) CLM16gwl NSW Office of Water, GW licence extract linked to spatial locations in CLM v2 28022014.

    "description": "Version 2 minor revision 27 June 2024.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest compilation of land use mapping information for Australia’s regions as at December 2023. The land use data are supported by a supplementary commodities dataset, containing extra information on the location of select predominantly agricultural commodities. These datasets replace the previous 2020 December updates. \r\nVersion 2 fixes issues caused during the conversion of the state vector datasets to rasters, where single pixel horizontal lines were generated in local areas. This does not affect the date or scale of mapping.\r\n\r\nThese data were compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs and other authoritative sources through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). These datasets are not recommended for change analysis or for national land use statistics—instead use the Land use of Australia 2010-11 to 2015-16.\r\n\r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n\r\nA seamless raster dataset that combines land use vector data for all state and territory jurisdictions, at a spatial resolution of 50 by 50 metres.\r\nShows a single dominant land use for each location, based on the management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies).\r\nUpdates have been made to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, the capital city of Adelaide, parts of the Great Barrier Reef NRM regions, and national updates to select horticultural tree crops and protected cropping structures. There are also minor corrections to Western Australia, and more accurate representation of mining areas in South Australia.  \r\nThe date of mapping (2008 to 2023) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary and are provided as supporting datasets. \r\nProduced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. \r\nRefer to the metadata and ABARES website for additional information.\r\n \r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n- Provides location, extent and year verified for 185 commodities, where mapped, as a vector dataset. \r\n- Commodity data are validated in the field and using other sources.\r\n- Generally, a single commodity is shown at a location reflecting the most recent date that location was verified.\r\n- The location of a commodity may change on a seasonal to annual basis, depending on factors such as climate, markets or farming systems.\r\n- Not nationally complete or comprehensive, and with various dates of capture (1967 to 2023) and input mapping products (2014 to 2023). \r\n- Refer to the metadata for additional information.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n- Land use: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 version 2, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, June, CC BY 4.0, DOI: 10.25814/2w2p-ph98\r\n- Commodities: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nDifferent types of loading zones operate across the Brisbane City Council area. Loading zones are located and operate at times where there is a demand for a particular activity such as passenger loading or delivering goods.\nBrisbane City Council has passenger set down and pick up loading zones available across the city. The locations of these zones can change over time, so you must check local signs to make sure you do not park illegally.  \n\nThese loading zones allow passengers to be dropped off or picked up without affecting traffic flows.  \n\nIf you park longer in these loading zones, even if you remain in your car, you can be fined. Make sure these spaces are only used to pick up or drop off.\nThe following data is an indicative guide of passenger loading zone locations across Brisbane. Please ensure you follow the parking signs at all times.\nFor more information about Brisbane’s parking zones, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/parking-in-brisbane/parking-rules/parking-zones\">Brisbane City Council website</a> or phone Council’s Contact Centre on (07) 3403 8888.",

    "description": "Report produced in collaboration between Universities and Commonwealth and State Government agencies.  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  provide national assessments of the status of key wild-capture fish stocks. The reports provide scientifically based stock status assessments for 68 key species (or species complexes), which cumulatively contribute over 90 percent of the value and 85 percent of the volume from Australian fisheries. \r\n• Stock status assessments in the 2014 reports are based on the abundance and level of harvest in 2013. In total, 238 stocks were assessed across the 68 key species; 129 stocks were classified as sustainable, these contribute around 87.5 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. There were 7 stocks classified as transitional-recovering, 19 as transitional-depleting, 11 as overfished and 4 as environmentally limited. There were 68 stocks where status was classified as undefined; these stocks contribute 6.4 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  focus on the status of targeted fish stocks. The status classifications do not consider broader ecosystem impacts of fishing, such as bycatch or habitat impacts, or social and economic considerations. These elements may be included in future editions, or companion reports. \r\n• The reports rely on a consistent national reporting framework that was developed collaboratively by fisheries scientists from around Australia. The framework provides transparency and consistency in stock status reporting across jurisdictions. \r\n• The Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  builds on the 2012 inaugural edition with 19 new species. Four of the new species are caught in Commonwealth fisheries. The additional species were nominated by the states and the Northern Territory as either iconic species that are likely to be seen in retail outlets or historically overfished species. \r\n• There were minor alterations to the national stock status classification framework and species chapters. The main update to the framework is the inclusion of the new environmentally limited stock category. The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  Advisory Group included this additional category to describe stocks depleted below the limit reference point by environmental factors rather than fishing. \r\n• Between 2012 and 2014 there have been a number of changes to stock structure and stock status for some species. In both cases the changes are based on the most recent and reliable information available. \r\n• The reports were developed collaboratively by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) and government fishery research agencies from all states, the Northern Territory and the CSIRO; more than 100 fisheries researchers were involved. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for December 1988. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "The collection of aerial photographs held by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre",
    "description": "Aerial photography has been an important means of acquiring spatial data in Antarctica and the subantarctic islands, though satellite imagery is playing an increasingly important role.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Data Centre's collection of aerial photographs includes (but is not limited to) the following.\n\n1 Vertical and oblique aerial photography of the Australian Antarctic Territory coastline and some inland areas, acquired by the US Navy during Operation Highjump in 1946/47.\n\n2 Vertical and oblique aerial photography flown by National Mapping (now part of Geoscience Australia) during 1954 - 1965 from fixed wing aircraft, mainly using a K17 trimetrigon camera. From 1960 the vertical camera in the system was replaced with a Wild RC9.  An Eagle V camera was also used in 1963. The photography was acquired along the Australian Antarctic Territory coastline  and over the Prince Charles Mountains.\n\n3 Comprehensive and systematic coverages of the Prince Charles Mountains and Enderby Land flown by National Mapping from a fixed wing aircraft in the 1970s using a Wild RC 9 camera.\n\n4 Photography acquired since 1977 from helicopters using non-metric Hasselblad and Linhof cameras. This photography was acquired principally for life science research and was not intended to be used for mapping. The photography was acquired over Heard Island, Macquarie Island, the Larsemann Hills, the Windmill Islands, the Vestfold Hills and Mawson Coast.\n\n5 Photography acquired since 1992/93 by the Australian Antarctic Division and AUSLIG (now part of Geoscience Australia) from helicopters using a Zeiss UMK camera. It has been used to acquire photography for large scale mapping of the Australian Antarctic Territory, Heard Island and Macquarie Island.\n\n6 Photography acquired since 2000 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a Wild RC8 camera. A revision of the guidelines for overflight heights over animal colonies required that animal census photography be done with a camera with a longer focal length than the Linhof camera previously used for this type of work.  This was in order to maintain the same scale at a greater height. The Wild RC8 camera has also been used for photography for mapping at the Windmill Islands.\n\n7 Photography of sea ice acquired since 2003 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a digital Nikon D1X digital camera.\n\n8 Photography of Adelie penguin colonies and other features acquired since 2009/10 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a digital Hasselblad H3D-II 50 digital camera.\n\nDigital flight lines and photo centres have been generated to represent the runs along which the photographs were taken and the centres of the photographs.  \n\n \n\nThe photos are scanned on a needs basis. Most of the Operation Highjump photos have been scanned but overall a minority of the photos have been scanned.  Preview images have been created of the scanned photos. The scanning of the Operation Highjump photos is described by a separate metadata record: 'Digital images of Operation Highjump aerial photography'.\n\nThe collection can be searched in two ways.\n\n1 A web search - see Aerial Photograph Catalogue link below.  Preview images of the scanned photos may be viewed using this search. In addition to the search, the Catalogue has tabs with information about viewing or obtaining photographs, the cameras used and further historical information.\n\n2  The flight line and photo centre data can be downloaded as shapefiles (refer to url below) and overlaid on topographic data in GIS software such as ArcGIS.  The Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) has mainly large to medium scale data topographic data available for download - refer to url below.\n\nThere are some flight lines for which photo centres have not yet been generated and some photo centres for which flight lines have not yet been generated.  This is being done gradually over time.  The flight line and photo centre shapefiles available for download will be updated about every six months.\n\nAlso available for download is a document with information about the cameras and a timeline for the photography - refer to url below.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nThe dataset is derived from the original River Types shapefile provided the NSW Office of Water for the Gloucester Basin. It has been clipped to the extent of the Gloucester Assessment Extent using the \"clip\" function in ArcGIS. It is similar to Version 2 except that stream lines are clipped to Gloucester Assessment Extent (AE)  instead of the Preliminary Assessment Extent (PAE).\n\n\n\nThe AE is slightly larger  than the PAE\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe dataset is derived from the original River Types shapefile provided the NSW Office of Water for the Gloucester Basin. It has been clipped to the extent of the Gloucester Assessment Extent using the \"clip\" function in ArcGIS. \n\n\n\nThe source spatial layer is derived from an Ecohydrology classification product, which is used to identify river hydrology classification base of the degree on intermittency flow of the rivers (see section 1.3.2 How Ecohydrology Classification is used).  The riverine features are identified using the River Style&#xAE; mapping (see section 1.3.3 How River Styles&#xAE; is used).\n\n\n\nRefer to \"Sayers, Jon (draft) Water Sharing Plan Environmental Flow Monitoring and Modelling Program manual, NSW Office of Water, Newcastle\" for further detail.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) Gloucester river types V03.

    "description": "The Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) has GeoEye-1 satellite imagery of northern Macquarie Island, captured 10 October 2011. The satellite provides panchromatic imagery with 0.41 metre resolution and multispectral imagery with  1.65 metre resolution.\r\n\r\nThe panchromatic and multispectral bands were orthorectified using the RPC data files and the AADC's 5 metre resolution Digital Elevation Model of the island (see metadata record 'Macquarie Island AIRSAR DEM (Digital Elevation Model)', Entry ID: macca_dem_gis). The RPC orthorectification process works on a pixel-by-pixel basis to provide correct ground locations. The orthorectified image files are called GE_10Oct2011_pan_orc and GE_10Oct2011_ms_orc. These two images were then pansharpened using Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening, the resulting image is called GE_10Oct2011_ps_orc.\r\n\r\nThe processing was done by Angela Bender of the AADC using IDL/ENVI version 4.8. The DEM was unprojected before the orthorectifications were done as ENVI version 4.8 requires a DEM, if used, to be unprojected.\r\n\r\nGround control points compiled by Angela Bender for the area covered by the image are provided (see a Related URL) but were not used in the orthorectification process. The ground control points were sourced from the AADC's survey control database and topographic data. The ground control points  could be used for future orthorectifications.\r\n\r\nThe pansharpened image could be coregistered with an orthorectified Quickbird  image captured 15 March 2005 (see metadata record 'Macquarie Island Quickbird Image (15 March 2005) orthorectification', Entry ID: Macquarie_Quickbird_15Mar2005) using 'image to image' transformation.\r\n\r\nIf this was done, the ground control points mentioned above could be used as a check of the coregistration. They could also be used to get an error estimate of the orthorectified Quickbird image.",

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTskin L3S product for 1 month of consecutive night-time periods, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 1 month average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe database includes water quality and environmental tracer information for springs and nearby groundwater in the vicinity of Elsey National Park (near Mataranka in the Northern Territory) collected during a field campaign in October 2019. This information was used to identify the origin of groundwater at the springs, especially two regional flow paths of the Cambrian Limestone Aquifer, and the possibility of a contribution from deeper aquifer(s).\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSpring and groundwater samples were collected from the Mataranka Springs Complex between 16 - 20 October 2019. The locations of the springs and bores and the bore construction details can be found in Table S1. Note that bore RN034030 located in the Antrim Plateau Volcanics basalt was the only bore available in the area that had a screen located in a geological formation other than the CLA. The two largest springs (Rainbow Spring and Bitter Springs) flow at 0.3 – 0.8 m3 s–1 and generate short streams popular as tourist attractions before they cascade into the Roper River. Rainbow Springs has one cluster of vents over approximately a 10 m2 area generating the streamflow, whereas Bitter Springs appears to have many vents (>10) spread over a larger, densely vegetated area (~1000 m2) joining together to form a stream. Warloch Pond Spring is one of probably many vents discharging into Elsey Creek, whereas Fig Tree Spring discharges horizontally from a cavity in a tufa cliff along the riparian corridor of the Roper River. These smaller springs have not been gauged previously but are estimated to have a discharge <0.1 m3 s–1. To avoid degassing losses, the springs were sampled by either installing a small submersible pump in a vent or, at Fig Tree Spring, by inserting a tube in the cavity. Samples were collected from one of the Rainbow Spring vents, two of the Bitter Springs vents and from the Fig Tree and Warloch Pond Spring vents (with, for selected analytes, two additional surface water samples collected from the Bitter Spring stream downstream from the vents). For groundwater samples, a submersible pump was lowered to the screen interval and the bore casing was dewatered for at least three bore volumes before sample collection was initiated. A YSITM multi-parameter probe (www.ysi.com) was used to measure pH, specific electrical conductance (EC), temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations. For major and minor elements, samples were filtered through a 0.45 m membrane filter and (for cations) acidified with (1% v/v HNO3). Alkalinity was measured in the field using a HACHTM titration kit (www.hach.com). Delta-18O and 2H samples were stored in 28 mL gas-tight glass bottles (McCartney). Tritium, 13C-Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and 14C-DIC samples were stored in 1 L HDPE bottles, unfiltered with no headspace and with no preservative. Sr (and strontium isotopes) samples were collected unfiltered in 125 mL plastic bottles. Spring and groundwater samples for noble gases were collected using the copper tube method. Major and minor cations were analysed by a SPECTRO CIROS Radial Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer and anions using a Dionex ICS-2500 Ion Chromatrograph at CSIRO Land & Water Analytical Services, Adelaide, South Australia. The charge balance error on the major ion measurements was ±5%. Strontium and 87Sr/86Sr were measured by Inductively-Coupled Mass Spectrometry at the CSIRO Land & Water Analytical Services. Stable isotopes of water were measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry at GNS, New Zealand with a precision of 0.1‰ and 1.0‰, for 18O and 2H, respectively. Noble gases were measured at the CSIRO Land & Water Noble Gas Laboratory using offline separation of gases from water by cryogenic techniques, separation of reactive gases from noble gases using catalyst and getter systems and separation of the noble gas fractions using cryogenic techniques down to 13 K. Total gas content was evaluated using a spinning rotor gauge, the isotopic composition quadrupole mass spectrometers and a high-resolution Helix MC noble gas mass-spectrometer (Suckow et al. 2019). Tritium was measured by electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting with a detection limit of 0.025 TU42. Radiocarbon and 13C-DIC were measured by accelerator mass spectrometry and Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry at the Rafter Radiocarbon Laboratory with an accuracy of 0.2‰ for 13C and a detection limit of 0.5% Modern Carbon (pmC) for 14C.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe Steedman EMS-16 Meteorological Station housing an R.M. Young anemometer and YSI barometer was set up near Governor Head, Jervis Bay (35.133S, 150.762E). The site was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nBetween 2nd November 1988 and 3rd November 1989 the station recorded wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure. \n\nThe Meteorological Station recorded 10 minute vector averages of the wind velocity and 10 minute values of air pressure. Data is presented in the oceanographic format i.e. 'direction going to'. The datasets titled 'Additional meteorological data' provide information on the average wind speed and direction, as well as the maximum gusts.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "From the SeaWifs NASA website:\n\nThe purpose of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Project is to provide quantitative data on global ocean bio-optical properties to the Earth science community. Subtle changes in ocean colour signify various types and quantities of marine phytoplankton (microscopic marine plants), the knowledge of which has both scientific and practical applications. The SeaWiFS Project will develop and operate a research data system that will process, calibrate, validate, archive and distribute data received from an Earth-orbiting ocean colour sensor.\n\nThe concentration of microscopic marine plants, called phytoplankton, can be derived from satellite observation and quantification of ocean colour. This is due to the fact that the colour in most of the world's oceans in the visible light region, (wavelengths of 400-700 nm) varies with the concentration of chlorophyll and other plant pigments present in the water, i.e., the more phytoplankton present, the greater the concentration of plant pigments and the greener the water. \n\nOcean colour data have been deemed critical by the oceanographic community for the study of ocean primary production and global biogeochemistry. &Primary production& refers to the organic material in the sea that is produced by &primary producers.& These &primary producers,& i.e. algae and some bacteria, exist at the lowest levels of the food chain and use sunlight or chemical energy, rather than other organic material, as sources of energy. It is thought that marine plants remove carbon from the atmosphere at a rate equivalent to terrestrial plants, but knowledge of interannual variability is very poor.\n\nSince an orbiting sensor can view every square kilometer of cloud-free ocean every 48 hours, satellite-acquired ocean color data constitute a valuable tool for determining the abundance of ocean biota on a global scale and can be used to assess the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle and the exchange of other critical elements and gases between the atmosphere and the ocean. SeaWiFS will operate as a follow-on sensor to the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), which ceased operations in 1986. In the first arrangement of its kind, the Government will procure space-based environmental remote sensing data for research purposes from a commercial operator. Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) will integrate SeaWiFS into its SeaStar spacecraft and will market the data for commercial and operational use following launch.",

These statistics are presented nationally, for the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), and by state for systems outside the sMDB. \r\n\r\n Accompanying the report is a database of water trades from 2007-08 to 2014-15, and a spreadsheet containing the data underlying all report figures and commonly requested statistics. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n In 2014-15, Australian water access entitlement trade and water allocation trade totalled 1796 GL and 5784 GL respectively. For water access entitlement trade, this was a decrease of 614 GL or 34 per cent compared to 2013-14, largely reflecting a decrease in Commonwealth environmental water recovery. For water allocation trade, this was an increase of 243 GL or 4 per cent compared to 2013-14. The Murray-Darling Basin accounted for 81 per cent of national water access entitlement trade and 94 per cent of national water allocation trade, after excluding 2172 GL of environmental transfers in the sMDB. \r\n\r\n The 2014-15 water year was characterised by below-average rainfall, runoff and streamflow in Australia. Storage volumes declined significantly, from 70 per cent to 59 per cent nationally. This continued a trend of declining storage volumes since the flood events of 2011 and 2012. The poor seasonal conditions resulted in water allocation percentages in major water markets being generally lower in 2014-15 than in 2013-14, driving increases in water allocation and entitlement prices in most water systems. \r\n\r\n Historically, there have been few constraints on trade between regions and trading zones within the major sMDB market, leading to fairly consistent water prices between regions. However, in recent seasons, trade restrictions have become more important, with changes in trade flows, the introduction of new limits and the reintroduction of previously suspended limits. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15, just 52 GL of water was recovered by the Commonwealth, predominantly through infrastructure. Around 5 GL of entitlements were purchased in 2014-15, mainly from the northern MDB. ",

    "title": "Survey report 1998/99 summer season Voyage 4 to 5, Australian Antarctic Division Authors - Matt King / Rachael Manson / Lee Palfrey / UTAS and Army",
    "description": "Taken from sections of the Report:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the 1998/99 Antarctic survey season was to provide survey control around Davis, Beaver Lake and the Prince Charles Mountains in support of the ANARE mapping program (ANAREMAGIP) as well as providing survey support for other ANARE science programs. \r\n\r\nSurveyors Matt King and Rachael Manson from the Centre for Spatial Information Science, University of Tasmania, already travelling to Davis as part of a ASAC project, were appointed as surveyors for the 1998/99 season.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Australian Army provided Cartographer/Surveyor Lee Palfrey to assist with the survey program in the Davis region.\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Division's Brief to Surveyors which outlines the details of the program is included in Appendix A. The survey program consisted of the following major areas:\r\n\r\n-  Photo control \r\n\r\n   -       Vestfold Hills (Platcha, Ellis Narrows and Marine Plain)\r\n\r\n   -       Larsemann Hills\r\n\r\n   -       Beaver Lake, Pagodroma Gorge and Soyuz station \r\n\r\n-  Field checking of photogrammetric plotting\r\n\r\n   -       Davis station digital map\r\n\r\n   -       Vestfold Hills\r\n\r\n   -       Larsemann Hills\r\n\r\n-  Providing GPS coordinates for all uncoordinated survey marks in the Vestfold Hills. \r\n\r\n-  Completion of various tasks relating to the Davis tide gauge\r\n\r\n   -       Downloading and retrieval of the existing tide gauge at Davis. \r\n\r\n   -       Installation of the new tide gauge at Davis. \r\n\r\n   -       Timed water-level measurements.\r\n\r\n   -       Precise levelling connection of the tide gauge bench marks with the ARGN GPS site at Davis.\r\n\r\n   -       Third order levelling to connect the current tide gauge bench marks to those previously used by the Royal Australian Navy.*\r\n\r\n-       Lake levels within the Vestfold Hills.\r\n\r\n-       Installation of a new tide pole for Deep Lake.\r\n\r\n-       Engineering surveys at Davis\r\n\r\n-       Aerial photography of penguin colonies along the coast near Davis.*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* These tasks were not included in the original brief but were carried out at the request of the Mapping Officer during the season.\r\n\r\nFlight lines and photo centres representing the aerial photography of penguin colonies were later created in the Australian Antarctic Data Centre. This data has Dataset_id 24 and is included in the the aerial photography data available for download (see URL below).\r\n\r\nGIS data was also created from data resulting from Matt King's survey of some features at Davis. The features include a fuel tank, some aerials, some electrical cables, some buildings, the SHIRE box (Physics apparatus) and a concrete pad. This GIS data has Dataset_id 24 and is included in the Davis GIS data available for download (see URL below).\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\n\r\nSeveral recommendations can be made from our experiences over the summer.\r\n\r\nWe recommend a complete inventory of all GPS base station observations be taken and summarised. After observing NMVS 4, HBM 1 and HBM 2 we found that these marks had already been observed during the 1997/98 season (Note: the latitude of NMVS4 is listed incorrectly on page 24 of the 1997/98 report). It has been proposed by the Mapping Officer that all GPS data over 2 hours in length be made available on CDROM in the future. \r\n\r\nWe further recommend that the various height datums in use in the Vestfold Hills be combined into the one datum. A least-squares adjustment of all height measurements made in the region would be a reasonably simple process (if all the data can be found!).\r\n\r\nIt is our understanding that the current differential GPS transmitter (for real time GPS corrections) at Davis is of poor quality and broadcasts broadband noise, interfering with other radio sources. As a result, the communications technicians are loathe to place the transmitter on a large antenna tower, thus significantly limiting the usefulness of real time differential GPS at Davis. If it is envisaged that real-time GPS corrections will be required in the future at Davis (or even the Vestfold Hills), this transmitter will need to be replaced. \r\n\r\nIt is widely held around station that significant errors exist in the current 1:50000 Vestfold Hills map. We are glad to hear that a new generation map is nearing completion. \r\n\r\nHaving used the Davis Science digital camera during the season, we recommend that a digital camera be regarded as an essential component of future mapping programs. It may prove beneficial if ANAREMAGIP were to purchase such a camera.\r\n\r\n",

The datasets derived from the monitoring are published and warning signs are put in place where required.\n\nInformation on water quality monitoring can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/environment-and-water/water-and-air-quality/water-quality-monitoring\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.\n\nThis dataset consists of the level of microbial contamination within Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. Brisbane City Council monitors of enterococci bi-monthly in summer and monthly during the cooler winter months. The presence of high levels of enterococci can vary daily, and may be elevated after heavy rainfall. Enterococci exposure can contribute to increased health risk and primary contact should be avoided.\n\nThe Data and resources section of this dataset contains further information for this dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts. A comprehensive description of the methodology and outcomes is available in this report.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

The data covers migrating settlers with a Date of Settlement between 01/07/2019 and 30/06/2020. The location data is aggregated based on the Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries of the 2011 Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC).\nThe data in this dataset are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit Data.gov.au.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data with the 2011 LGA boundaries of the ABS Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC). Where the recorded number of settlers is not provided (\"n.p.\" in the original table) the data has been set to null, and if the number is less than 5 (\"&lt;5\" in the original table) for confidentiality, it has been set to 4.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the south central section of Jervis Bay between 12/09/90 and 30/10/90. This 'Red' mooring (35.0895 S, 150.735 E) held three S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection. The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 10.5m have not been located and can therefore not be provided through this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied bioregional assessment data capture polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act). This is saved BA_all\\Hydrogeology\\Allocations\\_NoW_GW_entitlements_Oct13\n\n2. These spatial locations link to the licence volumes found in the \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls and the \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls as per below \n\n3.     The work locations in these shapefiles link to the  Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n4.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n5.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n6.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n7.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n8.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading). This means a spatial select with not find these WALs and the volumes associated with them. The WAL is still related to a particular Water Source and can be re-associated with a different Licensed Work Approval at a later date.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis data was extracted from  Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\nIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2013) CLM16gwl NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract Clarence Moreton-  Oct 2013.

    "title": "Parent record: Flow patterns within Jervis Bay: Winter deployment of current meters",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe second of these six experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay during the winter months, when the waters are only weakly thermally stratified. This winter mooring program was run as two deployments of current meters, from 10th July to 30th August and from 12th September to 30th October 1990, along with a meteorological station measuring winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head. [Given that this meteorological data bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.] \n\nTwo moorings were maintained with each deployment. In the first deployment (10/7/90 - 30/8/90) the south-central mooring contained 3 current meters and the northeast mooring 2 current meters. The second deployment (12/9/90 - 30/10/90) repeated the south-central mooring but the northeast mooring was moved south from near Green Point to off Honeymoon Bay.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There are four subsidiary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n6fed5f70-c336-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\na1da6830-c344-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\n45ede7c0-c3d2-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\n0b9e1780-c3d6-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile.

    "description": "The Air-Sea Flux Stations (ASFS) sub-facility is responsible for open-ocean moorings that measure real-time meteorological and oceanographic conditions at the sea surface.  In particular, the stations provide data on air-sea heat and moisture fluxes, which, when combined with meteorological data, are essential for climate change research.  The continuous time series provided by the air-sea flux stations are particularly important because many of the processes that control heat and moisture fluxes exchange show variability on a wide range of time scales. ASFS aims to deliver high quality air-sea flux measurements on a near real-time basis. \n\nObservations are obtained by the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) mooring in the Sub-Antarctic zone, south-west of Tasmania (46.75S 141E). The SOFS mooring has dual sets of radiometers, temperature and humidity sensors, precipitation gauges and sonic anemometers. \n\nData are broadcast via satellite back to Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. Daily files of 1-hourly averages of the observations and calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0200UTC and made available via the IMOS Ocean Portal.",

Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on known details at the time of acquisition. The dataset was acquired 3/11/16.\n\n\n\nThis dataset consists of a set of spreadsheets and text files containing raw water level data for bores across the whole of Queensland. A shapefile is also provided based on the registration spreadsheet.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis dataset represents an update of the groundwater data that was used to construct the potentiometric surface mapping presented in Evans et al. (2016). The reason for the update was that it became apparent that a lot of new data had been added to the groundwater database since July 2014.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nBorehole data, including water level information, provided to the Bioregional Assessment project by the custodian - QLD DNRM. No History has been provided.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) Queensland groundwater data October 2016. Bioregional Assessment Source Dataset.

    "description": "Separate Flood studies have been undertaken for four coastal lagoons in the Gosford area, that is, Avoca, Cockrone, Terrigal and Wamberal Lagoons.\n\nDifferent analytical approaches have been used for Avoca-Cockrone and Terrigal-Wamberal Lagoons. The physical processes involved in the break-out of the lagoons through the beach are complex. Thus, there is a potential for the different analytical processes to produce significantly different results.\n\nFor this study, separate MIKE-11 models were established for Terrigal-Wamberal Lagoons. These models were calibrated against the documented openings of August and September 1993.\n\nMIKE-11 models have been previously established for Avoca and Cockrone Lagoons as part of the Flood Studies.\n\nThe Avoca Lagoon hydraulic model established for the flood study was modified to remove the source of numerical noise which resulted in the over-estimation of the volume of water discharged to the ocean during the opening calibration event. The re-calibration did not alter the parameters for initial breakout of the lagoon.\n\nThe amendment of channel lengths in the Avoca model was also undertaken to remove a minor over-estimation of storage. The revised hydraulic model produced an estimated one percent AEP design flood level 20mm lower than that obtained in the flood study. This variation in estimated flood levels is not considered significant.\n\nIt is noted that the critical duration storm (that is, the design storm that produces the greatest water level in the lagoon) was the 9 hour storm for each lagoon.\n\nThe design flood level estimates for the one percent AEP flood in Terrigal Lagoon and Wamberal Lagoon determined by the review hydraulic model were within 30mm of the flood study estimates. This can be considered to provide independent verification of the flood study estimates.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nHunter Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling. The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. \n\n\n\nThe surface water component of the ZoPHC is derived from the reaches that are deemed impacted from the surface water modelled (sometimes referred to as Step 1 reaches) as well as additional non modelled reaches that are deemed to be potentially impacted due to interactions with the GW drawdown layer (aka Step 2) or proposed mine operations at the surface (aka Step 3).  How these are derived is expanded on in the History section of the metadata.\n\n\n\nThe SW ZoPHC is created from AU cells that intersect any of the impacted stream lines (from steps 1-3 above) as well as those which intersect GDE landscapeclass singlepart polygons withing 150m of the impacted stream lines.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing edits were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells. Mostly these occurred in the Macquarie-Tuggerah region of the ZoPHC to exclude AU cells selected due to intersecting upslope rainforest and wet schlerophyll forest GDE polygons in narrow valley areas.\n\n\n\nThe dataset contains the HUN_ZoPHC_source_AU_master_20171115.shp. It is the same as the previous one except that it has the additional field \"RIM_reason\" which identifies an AU as to what RIM analysis is subject to (eg \"forested wetlands\"). As before, it also contains the input component layers that were used to define the SW ZoPHC. They being \n\n1)      the bits of SW_Modelling reaches (above) that showed modelled or assumed change plus the additional rch_200 and rch_300 reaches\n\n2)      GDEs used to identify riparian AUs not intersected by the streamlines above but to be included in the SW ZoPHC.\n\n\n\nImportantly the ZoPHC_source_AU_master contains the reach id to which an Assessment Unit (AU) is allocated. \n\n\n\nImportant note:  an AU is only allocated to a reach if it is within the SW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nThis accounts for why there are some AUs that have a modelled reach passing through them but have a NULL \"allocreach\" value. It is because they are not in the SW ZoPHC. This will usually be because the reach shows  modelled \"no change\" or there is presumed no change due to the reach not being hydrologically connected to any ACRD activity. However there are some AUs that have been deemed by expert judgement to be not in the SW Zone because existing Baseline activity has nullified the potential ACRD impacts.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nA CON statement in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst was used to extract the area of the 95th quantile (HUN_dmax_acrd_quantile_95.asc from the input dataset) raster layer where drawdown was >= 0.2m. The resulting integer zone grid was vectorised into a shapefile. An anomalous zone on the SW boundary of the subregion that was an artefact of the modelling was deleted. The result is the GW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nSW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nthe outputs of the processes below can be found in the \"Input_Component_Layers\" folder of this dataset.\n\n\n\nStep 1\n\nPotentially impacted reaches were extracted from HUN_SW_Modelling_InterpolatedReaches_Network_20170220_v02.shp (source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). These are line features where \"SW_ZoPHC\" = 'yes' or 'part'. From these extracted \"impacted\" reaches, the line features classified as \"part\" were manually edited (cut) according to the description in the HRV (Hydrological Response Variables) LUT spreadsheet (HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02.xlsx in source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). This typically involved trimming the line back only to that in or downstream of the GW ZoPHC extent. Also some \"part\" impacted line features were cut where they intersected existing (i.e. baseline) open cut pits (OC). These excisions were done onscreen by eye, with reference to OC pit polygons used for modelling and existing mine workings shown in Google Earth imagery. The result after this trimming of selected features is the shapefile Step_1_SW_Model_ImpactedReaches_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp\n\n\n\nStep  2\n\nStreams other than \"highly intermittent ephemeral\" in the Hunter Perenniality layer, that where inside or downstream of the GW ZoPHC were selected and underwent the same Baseline open pit excision process as above. This became the Step_2_NonEphemeral_Streams_affected_by_GW_drawdown_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile. Note that some streams identified by Step 2 are already described in SW model (i.e. are included in the Step 1 features)\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\"highly intermittent ephemeral\" streams from the Hunter Perenniality layer that were inside or downstream of ACRD open cut pits (based on the GW model ACRD OC footprint polygons) were selected. This became the Step_3_Ephemeral_Streams_crossing_ACRD_pits_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile.\n\n\n\nUsing the three \"impacted\" stream layers derived above in conjunction with a singlepart shapefile, the final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and surface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) HUN ZoPHC and component layers 20171115.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nHunter Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input  and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.  The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of  equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. \n\n\n\nThe surface water component of the ZoPHC is derived from the reaches that are deemed impacted from the surface water modelled (sometimes referred to as Step 1 reaches) as well as additional non modelled reaches that are deemed to be potentially impacted due to interactions with the GW drawdown layer (aka Step 2)  or proposed mine operations at the surface (aka Step 3).  How these are derived  are expanded on in the History section of the metadata.\n\n\n\nThe SW ZoPHC is created from AU cells that intersect any of the impacted stream lines (from steps 1-3 above) as well as those which intersect GDE landscapeclass singlepart polygons withing 150m of the impacted stream lines.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing edits were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells. Mostly these occurred in the Macquarie-Tuggerah region of the ZoPHC to exclude AU cells selected due to intersecting upslope rainforest and wet schlerophyll forest GDE polygons in narrow valley areas.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nA CON statement in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst was used to extract the area of the 95th quantile (HUN_dmax_acrd_quantile_95.asc from the input dataset) raster layer where drawdown was >= 0.2m. The resulting integer zone grid was vectorised into a shapefile. An anomalous zone on the SW boundary of the subregion that was an artefact of the modelling was deleted. The result is the GW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nSW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nthe outputs of the processes below can be found in the \"Input_Component_Layers\" folder of this dataset.\n\n\n\nStep 1\n\nPotentially impacted reaches were extracted from HUN_SW_Modelling_InterpolatedReaches_Network_20170220_v02.shp (source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). These are line features where \"SW_ZoPHC\" = 'yes' or 'part'. From these extracted \"impacted\" reaches, the line features classified as \"part\" were manually edited (cut) according to the description in the HRV (Hydrological Response Variables) LUT spreadsheet (HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02.xlsx in source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). This typically involved trimming the line back only to that in or downstream of the GW ZoPHC extent. Also some \"part\" impacted line features were cut where they intersected existing (i.e. baseline) open cut pits (OC). These excisions were done onscreen by eye, with reference to OC pit polygons used for modelling and existing mine workings shown in Google Earth imagery. The result after this trimming of selected features is the shapefile Step_1_SW_Model_ImpactedReaches_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp\n\n\n\nStep  2\n\nStreams other than \"highly intermittent ephemeral\" in the Hunter Perenniality layer, that where inside or downstream of the GW ZoPHC were selected and underwent the same Baseline open pit excision process as above. This became the Step_2_NonEphemeral_Streams_affected_by_GW_drawdown_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile. Note that some streams identified by Step 2 are already described in SW model (i.e. are included in the Step 1 features)\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\"highly intermittent ephemeral\" streams from the Hunter Perenniality layer that were inside or downstream of ACRD open cut pits (based on the GW model ACRD OC footprint polygons) were selected. This became the Step_3_Ephemeral_Streams_crossing_ACRD_pits_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile.\n\n\n\nUsing the three \"impacted\" stream layers derived above in conjunction with a singlepart shapefile The final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and surface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) HUN ZoPHC and component layers 20170220.

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\n\"The image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 18 September 2015",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThe Gippsland database V2.1 supersedes the previous version (Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 10 September 2015, GUID: 45261e4b-fbd9-4853-bb16-2bf8c47bf018) which was found to contain errors. \n\nThis database (v2.1) should be considered as the update to v1.5 Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 16 June 2015, GUID: 178b98b7-3107-4cbf-b7ea-fc648c6f5870). \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v2.1  of the Asset database (GIP_asset_database_20150918.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (GIP_asset_database_20150918_GISOnly.gdb), an updated Water Dependent Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-GIP-ALL-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150918.xlsx), a data dictionary (GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Gippsland are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Gippsland bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database both M1 and M3 have been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset.The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \" GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc\" located in the zip file.Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted. \n\n\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe Asset List Database was developed to identify water dependent assets located within the Gippsland Basin bioregion.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t9/12/2014\tInitial database.\n\n1.2\t30/01/2015\t\n\nDatabase updated with elements and assets derived from additional source datasets: Economic_SW; VICADV_VulnFauna and Flora; Plantation Forests; Irrigation Districts; Inundation    100 year flood extent; Landscape Priority Areas (West); Farm Dam boundaries.\n\n\n\n1.3\t12/02/2015\tAIDs updated for new assets (existing AID + 20000) to avoid duplication of AIDs used in databases for other subregions.\n\n\n\n1.4\t9/06/2015\t\n\n(1) Previous groundwater, surface water, GMA and WSPA assets (sources: VIC_DEPI_ECON_GW, Vic_Surfacewater Licences Economic Asset Data, ECON_GW_VIC_GMA and ECON_GW_VIC_WSPA respectively) were turned off (i.e. the field of InRegister in table AssetList   has a value No). Theirs AIDs are from 16696 to 16706, 12006 to 12015 and 46598 to 46759.\n\n(2) New groundwater, surface water, GMA and WSPA assets (sources: VIC_DEPI_ECON_GW_May2015, VIC_DEPI_ECON_SW_May2015, VIC_ECON_GW_GMA and VIC_ECON_WSPA) were added in\n\n(3) New surface water polygon SDL data, which was also used to group surface water elements to assets, was added in. The new AIDs for (2) and (3) are from 46894 to 479081 inclusive\n\n(4)One previous asset (AID: 12729) is duplicated to one asset in MBC (AID: 11636) . its AID, Asset Name, Group, SubGroup, Depth, Source, ListDate and Geometry is using values from that MBC asset.\n\n(5) The name of one asset (AID: 15546) was changed because its previous name may be not for publication\n\n(6) The databases, especially spatial   database, were changed such as duplicated attributes fields in spatial data were removed and only ID field is kept.\"\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n(1) Change title to Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 16 June 2015 from subregion to bioregion\n\n(2) Update new AIDs (from 46894 to 47081 inclusive) on09/06/2015 to new AIDs (66894 to 67081inclusive): new \\[AID\\]=Previous \\[AID\\]+20000\"\n\n\n\nv2   10/9/2015   ERRORS IDENTIFIED\n\n(1) The explanations for M2 decisions have been updated based on advice from the project team. Detailed explanations were updated into the DecisionReason field of the AssetDecisions table, and the brief reason into the assetList and assetDecisions tables.\n\n(3) The draft BA-GIP-ALL-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150910.xlsx has been created as an output of this database.\n\n(4) Four standard queries have been included in the database to ensure consistency in obtaining asset and element counts and groupings for reporting. \n\n(5) Areas and lengths updated for assetList and ElementList tables polygons and polylines, where values were found to be null.\n\n\n\nv2.1 18/09/2015: Corrected M2 decisions incorporated into database and water-dependent asset register and asset list, as resupplied 15/9/2015.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 18 September 2015.

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "The dataset comprises 7019 individuals from 109 species of fishes, sharks, rays and sea snakes observed at around Mackay region Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Seabed Project Cruise 2 using 100 baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS(TM)). 805 images were captured from these cameras.\n\nApproximately 3500 of the best images from all BRUVS (TM) projects are stored in a reference library.\n\nData recorded concern:\n- classification of the habitat in the field of view (topography, sediments, benthos)\n- the identity of fish and CAABCODES\n- their time of arrival\n- their behaviour (8 categories, including feeding on the bait)\n- their maturity (adult or juvenile)\n- their relative abundance (as MaxN = the maximum number visible at one time, or distinguishable at different times as separate individuals e.g. much larger/smaller, male/female)\n- the time elapsed before MaxN and feeding occurs.\n\nA custom interface has been developed by AIMS staff, using Microsoft Access, for reading and analysis of BRUVS(TM) tapes.",

    "description": "The Portland Passive Acoustic Observatory consists of two to four moorings fitted with hydrophones set on the seabed at ~170 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of:\n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and\n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian).\n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",

    "description": "The Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update 2020 dataset is the national compilation of catchment scale land use data available for Australia (CLUM), as at December 2020. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2018. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. The CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management Classification version 8. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program. Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2008 to 2019) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. Date and scale of mapping are provided in a supporting dataset.\r\n\r\n#What’s new?#\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the December 2018 version: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nThe following areas include some reclassification; the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory, rural residential areas in New South Wales.\t\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. \r\n\r\n#Citation#\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay): \nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Sydney (South) - Haymarket in NSW with SA2 code 117031645, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "title": "Punchbowl Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes parts of the suburbs of Punchbowl,\nMount Lewis and Greenacre. It is an urban catchment that drains through a stormwater pipe network\nand the Sydney Water open concrete channel drainage system in a north-easterly direction towards\nthe Cooks River in the neighbouring Local Government Area (LGA) of Strathfield.\nIt is important to note that the Punchbowl catchment does not represent the entire (hydrological)\ncatchment to Juno Parade (at the Bankstown LGA boundary). The entire stormwater catchment is\nlocated in two LGAs; the western part of the catchment is situated in Bankstown City Council and the\neastern part is situated in Canterbury City Council, covering parts of the suburbs of Roselands, Wiley\nPark and Lakemba. This report focuses on the study area only, although the model was developed\nfor the entire catchment.\n\nFor the remainder of this document and for clarity, the Punchbowl catchment in this report refers to\nthe study area and is wholly located within Bankstown LGA while the entire catchment will be referred\nas the Punchbowl/Roselands catchment.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Indicative information on drainage asset performance for various storm events;</li>\n<li>A property database including surveyed floor levels, flood levels and the resulting floor level\nimmunity, expressed in the magnitude of a storm event;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 510 stormwater pits and 610 stormwater\ndrainage pipes or culverts. The database also contains model results, including information for each\npipe on the design event at which it is running full.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. The adopted grid size for this study is 2m, whereas the flood studies within\nBankstown undertaken prior to 2012 utilise a coarser grid size of 5m. The new grid size has been\nadopted in line with ongoing improvements in computer technology (in particular speed, memory and\nstorage) to provide higher resolution of the floodplain whilst allowing for manageable model\nsimulation times and file sizes. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and\nother assumptions are outlined in the Punchbowl Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is\nincluded as Appendix C.\n\nProperty Database\n\nThis flood study also includes the development of a GIS property database, utilising floor level data\ncollected by Council and comparing these to flood levels for various design flood events. This\ncomparison provides a dataset on floor level immunity, which is a very useful tool for assessing the\nexisting flood risk. Additional information such as property ground levels are also provided as part of\nthe property database. A summary of the property database is presented in Figure 5-1.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\nTable ES- 1 summarises the number of properties at risk from above floor level flooding in the\nPunchbowl stormwater catchment within Bankstown LGA.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThis data represents surface water entitlements inlcuding volumes extracted in ML in the Gippsland PAE. The initial data provided for Surface Water entitlements in the Gippsland PAE was extremely coarse. Water sources from River Basins (in the absence of more spatially representative features such as licence locations) were used in order to assign data to a general location. \n\nAt the Gippsland Asset workshop in December, 2014, better Surface Water Entitlement data was requested and Southern Rural Water provided this data by entitlement location on the 18/12/2014.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis dataset is an intermediate dataset to be included into a revised version of the Gippsland Asset database by ERIN\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nAs the new Entitlement data from Southern Rural Water did not contain volumes but rather individual locations for each entitlement, data was joined by licence number to an internal Bureau of Meteorology national dataset enabling ML per year per licence to be assigned to location. This was done using ArcGIS software.\n\nNote  there17 features without matching licence with a volume.\n\nAll data classified as \"Water Access Right\" as not broken down into the following codes of use:\n\nCODE \tDEFINITION \n\nWSUP \tWater supply \n\nIRAG \tWater supply for irrigated agriculture \n\nSTOK \tWater supply for livestock \n\nDRNK \tPotable water supply i.e. drinking water \n\nHUSE \tWater supply for household needs e.g. washing, toilet \n\nMNAS \tWater supply for mining activities \n\nINDS \tWater supply for manufacturing and industry \n\nINST \tWater supply for institution \n\nCOMS \tWater supply for commercial activities i.e. a service business that does not fabricate a product \n\nRECS \tWater supply for recreation and cultural activities \n\nEXPR \tExploration or research \n\nMINE \tMining i.e. extraction of minerals or energy resources \n\nRECN \tRecreational purposes \n\nMON \tMonitoring of groundwater conditions \n\nDRNG \tDrainage of groundwater principally to lower watertable or remove deleterious groundwater \n\nCULT \tFeature of natural or cultural significance \n\nUNK \tUnknown i.e. purpose of groundwater feature is unknown \n\n\n\nIn order to ensure only volumes and locations that were inside the Gippsland PAE were counted the the GIS location layer was clipped to the Gippsland PAE.\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics\n\n\\*\tCount:\t1144\n\n\\*\tMinimum:\t0\n\n\\*\tMaximum:\t1641.1\n\n\\*\tSum:\t137663.2\n\n\\*\tMean:\t120.334965\n\n\\*\tStandard Deviation:\t239.457137\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) Surface Water Economic Entitlements GIP 20141219.

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The e-atlas data we have provided is site means… i.e.. the mean of those 25 values. \r\n- LCC - Live coral cover (percent cover), live hard and soft coral pooled.\r\n- LHC - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n- MAC - Macro Algae Cover % (fleshy algas only, does not include turf algae)\r\n- Fish Line_SUM - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. = total number of lines/1500m2.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.\tWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans, R.D., Jones, G.P., Russ, G.R.

    "description": "This dataset shows the estimated maximum temperature of the warmest period for the Wet Tropics Bioregion of North Queensland over a 24 month period from January 2007 to December 2008. It was modelled based on weather station data, elevation, foliage cover and distance to the coast. The purpose of this dataset is as a metric for estimating thermal stress on animals living in this region.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nThe maximum temperate was modelled over the region at an 80 m resolution using weather station data with adjustments for elevation, foliage cover and distance from the coast. This allowed the temperature to be estimated for locations where there were no direct measurements of temperature. Models of the maximum temperature for each month of the study were generated. These 24 monthly surfaces were then overlaid and the maximum model temperature for any month was determined for each pixel to generate a summary variable - the maximum temperature of the warmest period (i.e., month).\n\n\neAtlas Processing:\n\nThe GeoTiff supplied with this dataset was produced as follows:\ngdal_translate csbc_05.asc -a_srs \"EPSG:4283\" -co \"TILED=YES\" -co \"COMPRESS=LZW\" -a_nodata -9999.0 WT_JCU_Refugia-max-temp_Jan2007-Dec2008.tif\ngdaladdo -r average WT_JCU_Refugia-max-temp_Jan2007-Dec2008.tif 2 4 8 16 32 64\n\nFormat:\nData format ASCII Grid: 170MB, 4089 x 6372 pixels, GDA_94, 80 m resolution. This was converted by the eAtlas team to a 33 MB GeoTiff.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nA detailed description of data and methods are provided in: Shoo, L.P., Storlie, C., VanDerWal, J., Little, J., Williams, S.E.

ZFD_corrected worksheet for ratio data with p_max data coming from ZFD worksheet.\n\nHFD. FD_corrected worksheet for both ratio and amax data\n\nAF. AF_corrected worksheet for both ratio and amax data\n\n\n\nMaps use the ratio data for mapping with classes shown on maps except where the following was true, the ratio was replaced with 'no significant change'\n\n\n\namax for LFD <3 (i.e. 3 is a blue dot, not an open circle)\n\namax for FD <3 (i.e. 3 is a blue dot not an open circle)\n\npmax for AF <1 percent (note this is pmax NOT amax)\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) Namoi HRV ratios.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis dataset containts multiple folders holding data on hydraulic properties for the CLM groundwater model.\n\n\n\n1.\tData in folder \"lay1\"\n\nData in folder \"lay1\" is for the alluvial aquifer within the groundwater model domain. \n\n\n\n2.\tData in folder \"lay2_3_4\"\n\nAll the data from the BMO group (consisting of the Bungil Formation, Mooga Sandstone and the Orallo Formation), the Gubberamunda Sandstone, the Westbourne Formation, and the Springbok Sandstone of the Surat Basin were combined. The resulting patterns of the hydraulic conductivity versus depth relationship were then used to inform an initial parameter range that constrains the Kx of the Grafton Formation (model layer2), the Bungawalbin Member (model layer 3) and the Kangaroo Creek Sandstone Member (model layer 4) in the Richmond river basin. \n\n3.\tData in folder \"lay5_6\"\n\nData from the Walloon Coal Measures in the Surat Basin (Bioregional Assessment Programme, Dataset 3) were used to constrain parameter variation in the Maclean Sandstone Member (model layer 5) and the Walloon Coal Measures (model layer 6).\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe data was derived to constrain the hydraulic property change in the Clarence-Moreton groundwater model.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\n1.\tData in folder \"lay1\"\n\nData in folder \"lay1\" is for the alluvial aquifer within the groundwater model domain. It was derived by using the groundwater model boundary (Bioregional Assessment Programme, Dataset 1) to filter the hydraulic property data generated in companion product 2.1/2.2 (Bioregional Assessment Programme, Dataset 2). \n\n2.\tData in folder \"lay2_3_4\"\n\nDue to a lack of bedrock aquifer data in the Clarence-Moreton bioregion, relevant data were sourced from hydrogeological strata in the Surat Basin (Bioregional Assessment Programme, Dataset 3), where much more data is available. However, as the correlation between the sedimentary bedrock stratigraphic units above the Walloon Coal Measures in the Surat and Clarence-Moreton basins is poorly understood, it is not possible to directly use the hydraulic parameters from a particular unit in the Surat Basin to inform the hydraulic characteristics of a unit in the Clarence-Moreton Basin. Instead, all the data from the BMO group (consisting of the Bungil Formation, Mooga Sandstone and the Orallo Formation), the Gubberamunda Sandstone, the Westbourne Formation, and the Springbok Sandstone of the Surat Basin were combined. The resulting patterns of the hydraulic conductivity versus depth relationship were then used to inform an initial parameter range that constrains the Kx of the Grafton Formation (model layer2), the Bungawalbin Member (model layer 3) and the Kangaroo Creek Sandstone Member (model layer 4) in the Richmond river basin. \n\n3.\tData in folder \"lay5_6\"\n\nData from the Walloon Coal Measures in the Surat Basin (Bioregional Assessment Programme, Dataset 3) were used to constrain parameter variation in the Maclean Sandstone Member (model layer 5) and the Walloon Coal Measures (model layer 6).\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nDataset 1 Bioregional Assessment Programme (2015) CLM Groundwater Model Boundary.

The dataset comprises a digital line coverage representing contour boundaries defining the marine incursion limits. The contour boundary information is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute table). Interpretation of these boundaries can be carried out using sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes. They represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles within the Windmill Islands.\n\nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

The frequency of service increases in summer when grass grows faster; however, this can be disrupted by significant rainfall or periods of extended dry weather. In these events, services are rescheduled as soon as it is safe and practical to do so.  \n\nIn most cases, the frequency of service ranges from monthly in winter to fortnightly in summer.

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis dataset provides the calibration metrics that describe the results of the AWRA-L model calibration process for the RIchmond river basin. This compares the model predictions with the measured stream flow at 9 stream flow gauging stations in the area. Summary of the \"normal\" and \"low flow\" AWRA-L model calibration metrics undertaken in the Richmond river basin (4 May 2015).\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nTo provide calibration summary of model efficiency etc. for the AWRA-L model in the Richmond river basin.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nStarted with the time series of AWRA-L model predictions for 2 calibrations (1: normal, 2: low flow) at 9 stream flow gauging stations.\n\n\n\nCompared these predictions to the measured stream flow at the same 9 stream flow gauging stations.\n\n\n\nThese comparisons are expressed through 3 metrics that compare the daily predictions with the observed data for both calibrations at each of the 9 stream flow gauging stations.\n\n\n\n1) F value\n\n2) daily flow efficiency\n\n3) Bias\n\n\n\nDetails of the metrics themselves are in CLM 2.6.1: Table 4\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Clarence-Moreton AWRA-L calibration results.

    "description": "The project will determine the status of threatened marine (green, hawksbill and flatback) turtles and dugongs in the Torres Strait and threats to these populations. It also will investigate links between different populations of dugongs and turtles in terms of movement and habitat use. They will also assess the abundance of dugongs in the Torres Strait using aerial surveys.\n\nWorking in conjunction with the Torres Strait Regional Authorities (TSRA) Land and Sea Unit and the TSRA Community Ranger program this project will:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nDetermine the status of green turtles in Torres Strait (sex ratios, patterns of juvenile recruitment, nesting success and hatchling production) using seasonal surveys of green turtle foraging and nesting sites. Foraging sites will vary to cover as many different habitats as possible (e.g. one per year). Nesting sites will include Maizub Kaur (Bramble Cay) and Dowar Island (Mer Group)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDetermine the status of hawksbill and flatback turtles in Torres Strait by conducting Iama community and Mabuiag Community seasonal surveys and trial remote camera deployments at Sassie Island and Malu Kiai (Deliverance Island) to quantify nesting events, which are suspected to be declining, and predation levels, which are speculated to be high. Data will then be used in combination with survey data collected by QDERM (Col Limpus) since 1992, and other life history and mortality data to determine a robust account of population status.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nInvestigate population connectivity of dugong and green turtles using satelite tracking of dugongs caught in the northern section of Torres Strait (i.e. around Biogu), analysis of previous tracking data (from QDERM, CRC TS, MTSRF and AMMC) of turtles and dugongs and collection of skin samples from dugongs and green turtles to strengthen the genetic understanding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nUndertake dugong and turtle aerial surveys in March 2011 and November 2013 of western Torres Strait, including the Dugong Sanctuary and the area west of Orman Reef in association with a parallel survey of the northern GBR. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nAnalyse historical data to examine patterns of turtle abundance in key areas such as western Torres Strait and the Dugong Sanctuary.\n</li>\n</ol>",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for October 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 10 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - +/- 3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - DTM (supplied by DNRM in .img format)\nDescription of Rectification - High end commercial photogrammetric software and Aerometrex proprietary software has been utilised in the ortho rectification and mosaicing process. This methodology assists Aerometrex to produce a seamless geo-referenced orthophotography product.\nTile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km GeoTIFF Tiles\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "__Note: This dataset has been superseded by the__ _Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities - Update December 2023_ available at https://doi.org/10.25814/zfjz-jt75.\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2020 dataset shows the location and extent of select agricultural, mining and forest product commodities, where mapped. This dataset replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2018 version 2 released on 26 November 2019. This dataset is the third national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at December 2020. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). The commodities data complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020 dataset (ABARES 2021).\r\n\r\n##What’s new?##\r\nThe following areas have updated mapping since the December 2018 version 2: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nMore detail has been added in the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory (2016).\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUMC datasets in their databases.\r\n\r\n##Citation##\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n The report presents results and analysis from a national survey of Australian sheep and cattle landholders in late 2014, in areas affected by wild dogs. The results are combined with data from a similar 2010 survey to assess longitudinal changes in wild dog impacts and management activities. \r\n\r\n Topics cover landholders' perspectives on wild dog problem severity and distribution, personal and economic impacts and collective management actions. The study also quantifies factors that influence the effectiveness of wild dog management groups and their achievement of outcomes. Around 1010 landholders participated in the 2014 survey. \r\n\r\n This study is the final phase in an ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) R.V. Aurora Australis collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 30 minutes. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0305S, 150.756E) between 11/07/90 and 29/08/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\n**Users should be aware that there appears to be some data corruption in the later stages of the datasets collected from 11.5m. In addition to this corruption, the decimated hourly dataset relating to the meter at 5.5m is unfortunately missing**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

To see more information on Environmental offsets visit: <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au:443/ACT-parks-conservation/environmental-offsets\">https://www.environment.act.gov.au/ACT-parks-conservation/environmental-offsets</a>\n<i>Who created the resource?</i>\nThe ACT Parks and Conservation Service (PCS) is the primary land manager of offset sites within the ACT, on behalf of the ACT Government. PCS has collated the environmental offset boundary datasets and continues to curate this dataset. Offset boundaries are established when a proposal by the proponent is accepted by the Commonwealth in accordance with the approval conditions.\n<i>Who was it created for? &amp; why was it created?</i>\nThis layer was created to support PCS with the ongoing management of environmental offsets within the ACT, and to be made publicly available as per the transparency requirements of the EPBC Act's Environmental Offsets Policy, and ACT Government's commitment to transparency.\n<i>When was it created?</i>\nEnvironmental offsets are proposed during the assessment stage of an environmental impact assessment under the EPBC ACT. The final offset boundary may not be agreed until post the approval is granted, and a condition of the approval is triggered. An newly approved offset is added to this dataset within 12 months of approval and offset boundary establishment.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the layers are free from error.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital polygon/point coverage of lakes and ponds identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface lake features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each lake/pond is represented as a polygon with a central point label which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles  within the Windmill Islands.",

    "description": "\n\n\nShort description: A network of natural and semi-natural areas which support critical ecosystem services, including connected native species habitats, and which provide for implementation of living infrastructure, active travel, climate adaptation and community wellbeing outcomes. An output of the Connecting Nature, Connecting People program, developed to guide land use and management decisions.\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\nMETHODS\nData collection / creation: The ecological network was initially derived from potential habitat and connectivity model outputs for grassland, woodland and aquatic-riparian ecosystems. These model outputs indicate potential habitat areas, fragmentation and whether a patch is big enough to provide core or corridor habitat functions for specific taxa groups. The network was created by identifying key patches of core habitat and corridors, as well as missing links that could reconnect fragmented patches. These were reviewed by several ecologists until the proposed network was agreed upon.\nThese agreed areas were converted to spatial data. Polygons were drawn around the relevant potential habitat and connectivity model outputs to simplify the data and visualise connections between habitat patches. The output was overlaid over other environmental data, including sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways and many more. Boundaries were adjusted to reflect these values as needed.\nThe ecological network was reviewed by subject matter experts and tested in a draft policy document released for public comment. Further revisions to boundaries were made following feedback. The final layer was dissolved and checked for geometry issues. \nNOTES ON USE\nQuality: The network considers an abundance and variety of datasets, including protected areas, potential habitat and connectivity maps, distribution of sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways, restoration projects, urban open spaces and community sites. Data was sourced from authoritative sources where possible. The network was verified and refined through wide distribution and review of the draft dataset, including by ACT Government ecologists and community members. Where possible, polygon boundaries were drawn around existing features (such as lakes or mapped habitat). Polygons were checked against the most recent aerial imagery to verify values and boundaries. This broad review of existing data and consultation on the output provides confidence the output represents the extent of our collective knowledge and provides a holistic illustration of known values.\nLimitations: The urban ACT Ecological network is a concept only. Polygon boundaries are hand drawn and imprecise. The data has not been ground-truthed. Boundaries should be considered approximate and verified with additional data and ground surveys. Further, the network does not assess feasibility or priorities. It does not consider species presence or absence, habitat condition, management regimes or tenure. This information should be gathered for decision making by referring to other environmental datasets, undertaking ground surveys and consulting with subject matter experts. \nData refinement: The dataset could be further improved by testing corridors against a feasibility ruleset (e.g. distance between core patches, width). Additionally, future research may support a wider range of uses by adopting a more technical approach to establish polygon boundaries or areas of interest. This would support higher spatial accuracy and enable greater certainty on what areas are within the network. A quantitative approach could support spatial statistics to aid decision making, e.g. through the ability to prioritise corridors. The Least-Cost Pathway Method is recommended for further study.\nSHARING\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0623S, 150.7672E) between 13/9/90 and 30/10/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nUsers should be aware that there appears to be some distortion of data within these files. For example, the depth data recorded by the meter maintained around 11.5m produced negative values and also readings of 132m! Salinity readings from the 5.5m current meter are also missing for the start of the record.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 5.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\n\n\nSILO is a Queensland Government database containing continuous daily climate data for Australia from 1889 to present. Gridded datasets are constructed by spatially interpolating the observed point data. Continuous point datasets are constructed by supplementing the available point data with interpolated estimates when observed data are missing.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nSILO provides climate datasets that are ready to use. Raw observational data typically contain missing data and are only available at the location of meteorological recording stations. SILO provides point datasets with no missing data and gridded datasets which cover mainland Australia and some islands.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nLineage statement:\n\n(A)\tProcessing System Version History\n\n\\*\tPrior to 2001\n\nThe interpolation system used the algorithm detailed in Jeffrey et al.1\n\n\\*\t2001-2009\n\nThe normalisation procedure was modified. Observational rainfall, when accumulated over a sufficient period and raised to an appropriate fractional power, is (to a reasonable approximation) normally distributed. In the original procedure the fractional power was fixed at 0.5 and a normal distribution was fitted to the transformed data using a maximum likelihood technique. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the goodness of fit, with a threshold value of 0.8. In 2001 the procedure was modified to allow the fractional power to vary between 0.4 and 0.6. The normalisation parameters (fractional power, mean and standard deviation) at each station were spatially interpolated using a thin plate smoothing spline.\n\n\\*\t2009-2011\n\nThe normalisation procedure was modified. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was removed, enabling normalisation parameters to be computed for all stations having sufficient data. Previously parameters were only computed for those stations having data that were adequately modelled by a normal distribution, as determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\n\\*\tJanuary 2012 - November 2012\n\nThe normalisation procedure was modified:\n\no\tThe Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test was reintroduced, with a threshold value of 0.1.\n\no\tData from Bellenden Ker Top station were included in the computation of normalisation parameters. The station was previously omitted on the basis of having insufficient data. It was forcibly included to ensure the steep rainfall gradient in the region was reflected in the normalisation parameters.\n\no\tThe elevation data used when interpolating normalisation parameters were modified. Previously a mean elevation was assigned to each station, taken from the nearest grid cell in a 0.05&#xB0;   0.05&#xB0; digital elevation model. The procedure was modified to use the actual station elevation instead of the mean. In mountainous regions the discrepancy was substantial and cross validation tests showed a significant improvement in error statistics.\n\no\tThe station data are normalised using: (i) a power parameter extracted from the nearest pixel in the gridded power surface. The surface was obtained by interpolating the power parameters fitted at station locations using a maximum likelihood algorithm; and (ii) mean and standard deviation parameters which had been fitted at station locations using a smoothing spline. Mean and standard deviation parameters were fitted at the subset of stations having at least 40 years of data, using a maximum likelihood algorithm. The fitted data were then spatially interpolated to construct: (a) gridded mean and standard deviation surfaces (for use in a subsequent de-normalisation procedure); and (b) interpolated estimates of the parameters at all station locations (not just the subset having long data records). The parameters fitted using maximum likelihood (at the subset of stations having long data records) may differ from those fitted by the interpolation algorithm, owing to the smoothing nature of the spline algorithm which was used. Previously, station data were normalised using mean and standard deviation parameters which were taken from the nearest pixel in the respective mean and standard deviation surfaces.\n\n\\*\tNovember 2012 - May 2013\n\nThe algorithm used for selecting monthly rainfall data for interpolation was modified. Prior to November 2012, the system was as follows:\n\no\tAccumulated monthly rainfall was computed by the Bureau of Meteorology;\n\no\tRainfall accumulations spanning the end of a month were assigned to the last month included in the accumulation period;\n\no\tA monthly rainfall value was provided for all stations which submitted at least one daily report. Zero rainfall was assumed for all missing values; and\n\no\tSILO imposed a complex set of ad-hoc rules which aimed to identify stations which had ceased reporting in real time. In such cases it would not be appropriate to assume zero rainfall for days when a report was not available. The rules were only applied when processing data for January 2001 and onwards.\n\nIn November 2012 a modified algorithm was implemented:\n\no\tSILO computed the accumulated monthly rainfall by summing the daily reports;\n\no\tRainfall accumulations spanning the end of a month were discarded;\n\no\tA monthly rainfall value was not computed for a given station if any day throughout the month was not accounted for - either through a daily report or an accumulation; and\n\no\tThe SILO ad-hoc rules were not applied.\n\n\\*\tMay 2013 - current\n\nThe algorithm used for selecting monthly rainfall data for interpolation was modified. The modified algorithm is only applied to datasets for the period October 2001 - current and is as follows:\n\no\tSILO computes the accumulated monthly rainfall by summing the daily reports;\n\no\tRainfall accumulations spanning the end of a month are pro-rata distributed onto the two months included in the accumulation period;\n\no\tA monthly rainfall value is computed for all stations which have at least 21 days accounted for throughout the month. Zero rainfall is assumed for all missing values; and\n\no\tThe SILO ad-hoc rules are applied when processing data for January 2001 and onwards.\n\nDatasets for the period January 1889-September 2001 are prepared using the system that was in effect prior to November 2012.\n\n\n\nLineage statement:\n\n(A)\tProcessing System Version History\n\nNo changes have been made to the processing system since SILO's inception.\n\n(B)\tMajor Historical Data Updates\n\n\\*\tAll observational data and station coordinates were updated in 2009. \n\n\\*\tStation coordinates were updated on 26 January 2012.\n\n \n\nProcess step:\n\nThe observed data are interpolated using a tri-variate thin plate smoothing spline, with latitude, longitude and elevation as independent variables.4 A two-pass interpolation system is used. All available observational data are interpolated in the first pass and residuals computed for all data points. The residual is the difference between the observed and interpolated values. Data points with high residuals may be indicative of erroneous data and are excluded from a subsequent interpolation which generates the &#xFB01;nal gridded surface. The surface covers the region 112&#x2DA;E - 154&#x2DA;E, 10&#x2DA;S - 44&#x2DA;S on a regular 0.05&#x2DA; &#xD7; 0.05&#x2DA;grid and is restricted to land areas on mainland Australia and some islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nGridded datasets for the period 1957-current are obtained by interpolation of the raw data. \n\nGridded datasets for the period 1957-current are obtained by interpolation of the raw data. Gridded datasets for the period 1889-1956 were constructed using an anomaly interpolation technique. The daily departure from the long term mean is interpolated, and the gridded dataset is constructed by adding the gridded anomaly to the gridded long term mean. The long term means were constructed using data from the period 1957-2001. The anomaly interpolation technique is described in Rayner et al.6  \n\n\n\nThe observed and interpolated datasets evolve as new data becomes available and the existing data are improved through quality control procedures. Modifications gradually decrease over time, with most datasets undergoing little change 12 months after the date of observation.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\n\"Queensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts\" (2013) SILO Patched Point data for Narrabri (54120) and Gunnedah (55023) stations in the Namoi subregion.

    "description": "The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) sub-facility aims to enable accurate, quality controlled, SST data to be supplied in near real-time (within 24 hours) from SOOPs and research vessels in the Australian region.\n\nRemotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data is an important input to ocean, numerical weather prediction, seasonal and climate models.  In order to improve calibration and validation of satellite SST in the Australian region, there is a need for high quality in situ SST observations with greater timeliness, spatial and temporal coverage than is currently available.  Regions particularly lacking in moored or drifting buoy observations are the Western Pacific Tropical Warm Pool region (Indonesia), close to the Australian coast (including Bass Strait) and the Southern Ocean.  Current ship SST observations from ships of opportunity (SOOP) are either of questionable accuracy or difficult to access in a timely manner.  \n\nThere are five vessels carrying automatic weather stations (AWS) that participate in the Australian Volunteer Observing Fleet (AVOF) program and two vessels equipped with a newly designed system for real-time SST data acquisition. Their routes include the Southern Ocean, coastal Australia (Queensland to South Australia), Bass Strait, Pacific Ocean, South-East Asia and the Tasman Sea. Four AVOF vessels with hull-mounted temperature sensors (Sea Bird SBE 48) and one with a digital oceanographic thermometer (Sea Bird SBE 38, RV L’Astrolabe) are supplying high-quality bulk SST data hourly. There is also one passenger ferry that is currently taking SST measurements using the high-accuracy SBE 38 sensor (MV SeaFlyte – Hillarys Harbour-Rottnest Island). In addition, there are now near real-time SST data streams available from two Australian research vessels (RV Southern Surveyor and RSV Aurora Australis), one New Zealand research vessel (RV Tangaroa), and a small research vessel operated by CSIRO near the south-east coast of Western Australia (RV Linnaeus). In total, twelve vessels send SST data in real-time. All SST data are being quality assured, placed on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and fed into the Bureau of Meteorology's near real-time satellite SST data validation system and operational regional and global SST analyses. Additionally, there are historical SST observations from four vessels which are not currently available in real-time: passenger ferry MV Fantasea, Whitsundays area, radiometer and bulk SST (November 2008 to March 2010); two AVOF vessels: MV Iron Yandi (February 2010 to January 2011) and PV Pacific Sun (December 2010 to July 2012); and one Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS), MV Pacific Celebes which has been carrying high-quality scientific equipment (January 2008 to March 2012).",

    "description": "Irrigated agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin: an economic survey of irrigators 2012-13 to 2014-15 presents key farm performance measures for irrigated horticulture, dairy, cotton and rice farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n The first three survey years (2006-07 to 2009-10) were severely affected by drought, with record low inflows to river systems and low irrigation water allocations. Incomes of horticulture, dairy, rice and cotton farms were relatively low throughout this period. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash incomes from 2010-11 onwards were mostly higher than in the first three survey years as seasonal conditions improved and water allocations increased. \r\n\r\n Water trading was an important tool for irrigators to manage low water allocations during severe drought, particularly between 2006-07 and 2008-09. The survey results show the proportion of farms trading water allocations rose from 2006-07 to 2008-09, then declined until 2010-11 as water supplies became more plentiful after the drought ended. ",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2017 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "title": "Genetic management of threatened koala populations: Using genotyping-by-sequencing to define meaningful conservation goals",
    "description": "Genetic management is a critical component of threatened species conservation. Understanding spatial patterns of genetic diversity is essential for evaluating the resilience of fragmented populations to accelerating anthropogenic threats. Nowhere is this more relevant than on the Australian continent, which is experiencing an ongoing loss of biodiversity that exceeds any other developed nation. However, while threatened species management is generally the purview of state governments, intensive data collection at this scale is often neglected, despite arguably being the most useful for guiding ongoing conservation efforts. Using a proprietary genome complexity reduction-based method, we generated a data set of high-quality Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate spatial patterns and indices of genetic diversity in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), a highly specialised folivorous marsupial that is experiencing rapid and widespread population declines across much of its former range. Genotyping of 314 individual koalas sourced from across the state of New South Wales was performed using the Diversity Arrays Technology platform (DArTseq™) with funding provided by the NSW Government under the New South Wales Koala Strategy (Grant Agreement No. KR_2019_01). \nOur findings demonstrate that current management divisions across the state of NSW do not fully represent the distribution of genetic diversity among extant koala populations, and that care must be taken to ensure that translocation paradigms based on these frameworks do not inadvertently restrict gene flow between populations and regions that were historically interconnected. We also recommend that koala populations should be prioritised for conservation action based on the scale and severity of the threatening processes that they are currently faced with, rather than placing too much emphasis on their perceived value (e.g., as reservoirs of potentially adaptive alleles), as our data indicate that existing genetic variation in koalas is primarily partitioned amongst individual animals. As such, the extirpation of koalas from any part of their range represents a potentially critical reduction of genetic diversity for this iconic Australian species.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Effective environmental impact assessment (EIA) relies on rigorous scientific assessment of all potential causal pathways by which large-scale developments may impact on valued assets in a region. Despite their importance to decision-making, many EIAs are flawed by incomplete analysis of causal pathways, limited spatial assessment and a lack of transparency about how risks have been evaluated across the region. To address these, we developed an EIA methodology based on network analysis of potential causal pathways in a given region. This network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘potentially high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the Cooper GBA region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset has the input spreadsheet describing the nodes and links in the Cooper causal network (COO_input.xlsx) and the spreadsheet summarizing the results of the spatial causal network analysis (COO_output.xlsx). The dataset also contains all the grids associated with the link evaluations (grids/input) as geotiff files. The filename corresponds to the entries in the gridname column in the input spreadsheet. The dataset also contains the output grids as geotiff files. These are stored in the directory grids/outputs, organised in a directory per endpoint. Each of these directories contains: 1. a png file of the subnetwork of links leading to that endpoint, 2. the overall impact grid (geotiff), 3. a heatmap of number of processes of concern for each endpoint (geotiff) and three subdirectories (activity, stressor, process) of the impact grids of the causal pathways that contain the activity, stressor or process.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Calculations to support the vertical fracture extents due to hydraulic fracturing used in the Hydraulic Fracturing node description.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nKear and Kasperczyk (2020) adapted the approach introduced in Pandurangan et al. (2018) to conservatively estimate the vertical fracture extent across the Cooper GBA region. Propagation of fractures between wells from the same pad completed in the same formation are common and pose a low risk as the wells would be designed and constructed to withstand the imposed fluid pressure from the intersecting hydraulic fracture. Refer to the PDF document in the zip file for details of the parameters and script used to calculate the fracture extent.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nKear J and Kasperczyk D (2020) Hydraulic fracturing and well integrity review for the GBA regions.
