    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 12 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

Groundwater samples are assigned to the following hydrostratigraphic units: Antrim Plateau Volcanics/Helen Springs/Jindare, Bukalara, Cenozoic, Cretaceous, Jinduckin/AnthonyLagoon/HookerCreek; Proterozoic and Tindall/GumRidge/Montejinni.\r\nVariables used for the analysis included major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO3, Cl, SO4), electrical conductivity (EC) and pH with data normalised for statistical calculation. Datapoints with charge balance error above 10% have been removed prior to interpretation. The interpretation resulted in five clusters with distinct geochemical properties, as described in the respective section of the technical report Hydrogeology of the Beetaloo GBA region.\r\nCheck column source to identify data origin with references in the above mentioned report.",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016</b> \n(Overlay Dataset 2 of 4, needs to be used in conjuction with points, polygons and North Lakes Locality datasets). \nThe Infrastructure Buffers Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.Restricted\nRestricted\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\nUsers must attribute the Department as the data provider.",

They were published under the title \"Standard plans of the city of Melbourne\". They were digitised by the City of Melbourne and geo-referenced.\n\n\n\nThe same maps are avaiilable through the State Library of Victoria: http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/126848\n\n\n\nTo help you choose between the two sources, here are some of the differences:\n\n- the SLV digitisations are higher quality, with fewer artefacts such as other maps bleeding through\n\n- the SLV has a web viewer, enabling you to quickly view each map online\n\n- the CoM versions are geo-referenced JPEG2000 files, meaning you can overlay them on a map\n\n- the CoM files are available for bulk download\n\n\n\nThere is no copyright on these map images.",

    "description": "Since the peak of the Millennium drought, the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) has seen large increases in nut and cotton plantings, decreases in water supply due to environmental water recovery and tighter limits on water trade between regions. These changes have raised concerns about how the water market might cope under drought conditions. \r\n\r\n In this study, ABARES applies an economic model of the sMDB to simulate what would happen to the water market under a repeat of the Millennium drought, with current water demand, environmental water recovery, trade limits and carryover rules. These scenarios provide an indication of future water prices and trade patterns across the sMDB under a repeat of historical climate conditions (for the period 2002-03 to 2016-17). \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n• Modelling results suggest that under a repeat of historical conditions allocation water prices in the sMDB would rise no higher than the peaks observed during the previous drought. \r\n• Whilst demand for water has increased for cotton and almonds, this has been more than offset by reductions in demand in other industries particularly, grazing, dairy and rice. \r\n• Improvements in carryover rules will help to limit price rises under a repeat of the drought, with much larger volumes of water being stored between years. \r\n• Trade limits will likely be binding more often in the future, partly due to the changes in water demand. \r\n• While water price peaks are simulated to be no higher under a repeat of extreme drought conditions, they are higher on average, due in part to environmental water recovery. The modelling suggests a change in the distribution of prices, with fewer years of low prices.\r\n",

    "description": "The ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_R line features represent the set of river reaches that are assessed in the 2010 ISC. The line features represents the middle of the river channel and have been defined as the midpoint of the ISC2010_STREAMBED_WIDTH polygon feature.  This data set represents a re-alignment of the ISC2004 River Reaches. River centre lines have been connected at Reach ends and flow direction has been enforced. Each Reach has Metric Statistics assessed and recorded in Reach Summary (_R) Tabes. \n\nThe ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_R is designed to JOIN to all ISC2010__R tables.\n\nThe ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINE_REACH acts as the spatial key to which all other Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation reach metric statistics can be linked.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of general practitioner (GP) attendances and associated Medicare benefits expenditure per person. GP attendance has been calculated with the total services from eligible claims (excluding any bulk-billed incentive items or other top-up items), divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as at 30 June 2016. GP expenditure has been calculated with the total benefit paid for eligible claims, divided by the ERP as at 30 June 2016. The data spans the financial years of 2010-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nGP after-hours attendances are Medicare benefit-funded after-hours patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. They include urgent and non-urgent attendances.\n\n\nExpenditure on GP/specialist attendances comprises MBS funding for patient/doctor encounters. Expenditure is reported unadjusted for inflation.\n\n\nBulk-billing is an arrangement in which a medical practitioner sends the bill directly to Medicare, so the patient pays nothing. Also known as direct billing.\n\n\nAge-standardisation allows fairer comparisons to be made between areas by accounting for variation in the age of populations within each area. This adjustment is important because the rates of many health conditions and health service use vary with age.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\n<strong>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</strong>\nRiver and Creek Flooding\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside.&nbsp;\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i>&nbsp;Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions&nbsp;- with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage.&nbsp;\n<i>Purpose</i>:&nbsp;To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure&nbsp;with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach&nbsp;based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations.&nbsp;<i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i>&nbsp;\n<i>Flood Height:&nbsp;</i>Indicates the approximate water surface level of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event, expressed in metres above mean sea level. This dataset represents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of 0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i>&nbsp;The dataset includes three possible flood events of different probability.\n<i>Likelihood: Likely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood:&nbsp;Possible</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):&nbsp;1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):&nbsp;100 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood: Unlikely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year</i>\n<i>Version Notes&nbsp;3.1.0</i>&nbsp;- First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE.

Model does not include underground structures however rainfall was scaled down to account for the possibility of some run-off being contained within the underground system. A post-process was applied to eliminate areas of shallow depth, low velocity and low velocity depth product. Additional removal of model errors and small property intersects using spatial analysis and manual techniques.<i>Existing Conditions Scenario:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Modelled estimate of the extent of overland flow paths following a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability storm outside the river and creek flood extent and with some model errors and small property intersects removed.<i>Purpose:</i>&nbsp;To determine flood extent along overland flowpaths in areas outside the extent of the river and creek flood modelling. Suitable for public dissemination.<i>Flood Extent:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indicates the approximate extent of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event (not actual recorded levels). The inundation area may be less accurate where the property is flat near the outer limit of inundation, or where the ground surface has been modified since being surveyed.This dataset represents the flood extent as vector polygons without attribution.<i>Modelled Probability:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is:&nbsp;1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year<i>Likelihood:</i>&nbsp;Possible<i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):</i>&nbsp;1%<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):</i>&nbsp;100 YearA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but neverthess still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.<i>Version Notes&nbsp;1.25.0 - Sub set of F01 Version 1.24 with areas removed where field Public = N in F00N Version 1.18.8 (April 2025)</i><i>Version Resolution: 1.0m</i><i>Data Reliability: D</i><i>Indicates that Council can only provide an extent but not levels as the flood data is of limited reliability</i>\n<i><strong>Further Information</strong></i><i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website </i><a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">Flood information for residents of Moreton Bay - City of Moreton Bay</a>",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions.

    "title": "Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 16 September 2015",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis V7 database has been updated to include the Receptor data from Clarence-Moreton assessment team. The relevant tables of ReceptorList and tbl_Receptors and the spatial data of  GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt  were added to this version. The Clarence-Moreton Asset database v7 supersedes the previous version of the Asset database only in Receptor relevant tables/ feature class (i.e. ReceptorList, tbl_Receptors and GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt ).\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v7  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150916.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150916_GISOnly.gdb), the draft Receptor Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-140-ReceptorRegister-V20150916.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.

    "description": "The purpose of the experiment was to quantitatively examine the colour changes associated with moulting in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin between Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nCircular cages were constructed on the mud flat and characteristically marked crabs were introduced. In total 11 females and 10 males were photographed through at least one moult.\n\nOn average, U. capricornis grow 1.6mm with every moult. With every successive moult the carapace pattern contracts and becomes more distinct, especially in males. In addition to the considerable variation in pattern, both sexes also vary in the specific colour of their spots. Colour changes are associated with moulting and, as with pattern, tend to follow a certain progression.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis data set comprises the  inputs, parameters and outputs of the OGIA groundwater models as used for BA groundwater modelling reported in the product 2.6.2 of Maranoa-Balonne-Condamine subregion. Only one input file (MODFLOW drain package input file) was modified for the BA specific model runs. This input file is provided within the folder named NIC_MBC_Model_Input_files. All other model inputs are the same as is used in the OGIA model runs for Underground water Impact Report 2012. These inputs may be requested from Office of Groundwater Impact Assessment and is not published in the BA repository as per the agreement with OGIA.\n\nThe OGIA drain package has been modified to include the boundary conditions caused by 7 mines in the MBC subregion. For this  a python script was written. The script reads the original drain package file (ASCII file) of OGIA model and then write additional drain cells to the file at the locations of the 7 mines - Commodore, newAcland stage 2, Wilkie Creek, Kogan Creek, Cameby Downs, New Acland stage 3 and The Range. The script reads the locations of these mines from input files - .dat  (to the script) with names similar to the mine names. The locations of the mines are specified as rows and columns of the model grid in these input files. These files also have the elevations of the drain cells (bottom/centre of the cells in the Walloon Coal Measures in which the coal mine pit is present). The location and elevation data were obtained from OGIA  and is registered as a separate data set. \n\nTwo copies of the  python script are present in the folder corresponding to the baseline and CRDP drain packages.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nAll the model input data files were obtained from OGIA with the condition that these will not be published. The drain package input file and all output files were generated by CSIRO Land and Water by using CSIRO generated scripts and by running the model using these inputs. The drain package has inputs from the original OGIA model drain pakcage and additional data obtained from OGIA and coal mine footprint data. \n\n\n\nThe coal mine footprint data sets is registered as a separate data set. The OGIA model is not registered as a separate source data set as it is not publishable as per the agreement.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) MBC Groundwater model.

    "description": "####_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._####\r\n\r\n### Background ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information. \r\n\r\n### 2020 AIS data ###\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2020 AIS information lodged by multiple charities. \r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2020 AIS data. This report - the 8th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on [our website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/tools/reports/australian-charities-report-8th-edition).\r\n\r\n### Interpreting AIS data ###\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au).\r\n\r\n### Withheld information ###\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n### More ACNC data ###\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. \r\n",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and covers the northern part of the suburb of Chester\nHill. It is an urban catchment that drains through a stormwater pipe network in a north-easterly\ndirection to the Parramatta Council Local Government Area (LGA). The Wolumba catchment is one\nof the sub catchments of Duck River, and is wholly within the north western section of Bankstown City\nCouncil (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 160 stormwater pits and 220 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Wolumba Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix B.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix B.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the current Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of national land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for application to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature conservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved tenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series. Further information can be found on the Forests Australia website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/",

Photopoints were taken annually using the five point photopoint method. The set of images for each year usually consists of twenty images: four images taken at each corner of the plot facing each of the four cardinal points, and four images taken from the center of the plot facing each corner. \n\nThe Karawatha Peri-Urban Site was established in 2007 and decommissioned in 2018. The site was located in Eucalypt forest at Karawatha Forest. For additional site information, see https://deims.org/f15bc7aa-ab4a-443b-a935-dbad3e7101f4. \n\nOther images collected at the site include digital cover photography and ancillary images of fauna and flora.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. This pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 5. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors as well as a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "A survey of the east Tasmanian coastline from Musselroe Bay to South East Cape revealed a total of 10 km2 of Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh 1820 kelp forest. Average harvestable quantities based on Alginates (Australia) Company records (1965-72) show that cropping can expect to yield 5 ton/acre or 1.23 kg/m2. This realizes a total of 12,300 tonne available on the East Coast of Tasmania in 1986. Review of past records show fluctuations in total amounts harvested, due possibly to factors such as high oceanic water temperatures with subsequent low nutrient concentrations and storm damage.\nThe survey was conducted from a light aeroplane. Areas of Macrocystis pyrifera beds were marked on 1:100,000 topographical land tenure maps using landmarks as references. Digitising of bed outlines on maps was done using Mapinfo.\nWeight of Macrocystis per unit area is also estimated from quadrats harvested at a number of sites along the coast.",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nFreshwater basil aquifer data indicates the approximate boundary of the fresh water basal aquifer on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behaviour on the island.\nThe boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to a generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the freshwater basal aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection.   In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift. \nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Australian National Mooring Network Facility is a series of national reference stations and regional moorings designed to monitor particular oceanographic phenomena in Australian coastal ocean waters. \n\nThere are seven sub-facilities in the ANMN: four regional sub-facilities, a series of National Reference Stations (NRS), Acoustic Observatories and an Acidification Moorings sub-facility.\n\nThe ANMN sub-facilities are:\na) Queensland and Northern Australia\nb) New South Wales\nc) Southern Australia\nd) Western Australia\ne) Acoustic Observatories \nf) National Reference Stations (Coordination and Analysis)\ng) Acidification Moorings\n\nThe National Reference Stations were first established in the 1940’s and are the backbone component of the observing system.  Extended by IMOS from three to nine sites around the entire Australian continent, the stations report integrated biological, chemical and physical oceanography time series observations, upon which more intensive local and regional scale studies can be referenced against. The regional moorings monitor the interaction between boundary currents and shelf water masses and their consequent impact upon ocean productivity (e.g. Perth Canyon Upwelling; Kangaroo Island Upwelling) and ecosystem distribution and resilience (e.g. Coral Sea interaction with the Great Barrier Reef ). Operation of the network is distributed between several operators and coordinated nationally.\n\nPassive acoustic listening station arrays are located at three sites. These stations provide baseline data on ambient oceanic noise, detection of fish and mammal vocalizations and detection of underwater events. The Acidification Moorings are co-located at three of the National Reference Stations, and provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.",

It was first deployed in 2011, but subsequently damaged by Tropical Cyclone Yasi in February 2011. It was replaced in September 2013.\n\nThe mooring's instruments measure surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. Current instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and a WETLabs WQM.\n\nThe Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification. The Yongala acidification moorings is located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the birthrate per 1,000 women aged younger than 20 years, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the years 2013-2015 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC) and historical data for time trends. Where the term 'teenage mother' is used the analysis is based on women who gave birth aged under 20. Teenage mothers and their babies are more likely to experience broader disadvantage, have antenatal risk factors and have poorer maternal and baby outcomes during and after birth, than older mothers and their babies. \nThe Teenage Mothers in Australia data accompanies the Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nExcludes women not usually resident in Australia or whose usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

Previous observations of a few of these sources with the Parkes UWL receiver have proven its utility in follow-up timing observations of MeerKAT discoveries.\n  MeerKAT has discovered a few more RRATs in its latest observing cycle and more good quality UWL observations of these sources are required to determine the rotational period and period derivative and also to facilitate the study of their emission properties. Therefore, we request follow-up observations of 5 new sources to achieve this and to further enable spectral and polarization studies of these sources. Given the potential link between RRATs, magnetars, and some fast radio bursts (FRBs) suggested by both observations and theories, this study could reveal more similarities between these different classes of transient sources and significantly advance our understanding of their origins.",

    "description": "Purpose: Management of Groundwater resources in Western Australia.\n\nGroundwater Resources stored in WRIMS (Water Resource Information Management System). \n\nThe intersection of groundwater Subareas with Aquifer boundaries (usually) define groundwater Resources, \nwhich are the units used by the DWER to manage environmentally sustainable limits of extraction for \ngroundwater resources.\n\nFor the purposes of groundwater resource management, the state of Western Australia is divided into \ngroundwater areas proclaimed under the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act. These groundwater areas are\nfurther subdivided into groundwater subareas. The subareas are not proclaimed under the Rights in Water\nand Irrigation Act, but are administrative boundaries used to manage the extraction and licensing of \ngroundwater resources.\n\nGroundwater Resources in this dataset are not always the intersection of a Subarea with an Aquifer. \nAdditionally, the Groundwater Areas stored in WRIMS do not accurately reflect the official gazetted \nGroundwater Area boundaries. A program is currently underway (Sept 2005) to review both Groundwater \nResource and Groundwater area boundaries. Please contact the data steward for more information.",

It is important to note that Queensland Police Service offender statistics are based on offence counts and do not and cannot refer to individuals. Rather, offender data refers to the number of offences cleared or solved through an action against an offender. As such, offender data does not equate to a unique offender count nor does it equate to the number of offences cleared. Only persons ten years and over deemed to be offenders, Juvenile offenders are those aged between and including ten and sixteen years. Offenders have not been included if their age or gender is not specified in Queensland Police Service records.",

    "description": "A series of 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 8. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "In January 2008, stereo-video surveys were conducted in the proposed Capes Marine Park at 3 sites within each of three locations.  It appears that the relative composition of the assemblage sampled by baited stereo-video stations and diver operated stereo-video transects differs over a gradient in latitude that is likely to correspond to variation in the trophic composition of fish communities. A cost-benefit analyses showed that baited stereo-video methods were generally more cost-efficient than diver operated stereo-video transects for detecting change in the fish assemblage.\nThis data was used with data from Ningaloo and Abrolhos regions in a larger study that compared the assemblage composition, relative abundance and size of fishes sampled using Baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo BRUV) and Diver-operated stereo-video systems (stereo DOV).",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) indicators by area. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity)\n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility.\nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Route Segment (Polyline) 2016\".\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website.

This service generally contains the current standard Topographic maps from the 1:100,000; 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 series.\nWhere coverage exists at multiple scales, the largest scale map is displayed. \n\nThe sourced Geotiff file is cropped to the map window only, with no legend, disclaimers, map grid, scale bar or north arrow displayed. The NSW Topographic Map series is derived from Spatial Services’ Digital Topographic Database (DTDB). \n\nInformation viewed in this web service includes:• Roads• Points of interest• Localities• Contours• Drainage• Cultural data• Parks and forests• Property boundaries. \n\nThis web service allows users to easily integrate the topographic map cache coverage for NSW into Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant spatial platforms and applications. \n\nThe NSW Topographic Map Cache web service can be used for mapping, emergency services, natural resource management, geosciences and sustainable development. \n\nThis service ensures users are able to consume topographic map data without the requirement of hosting the map files on their own servers. It is important to note that depictions of roads and tracks do not necessarily indicate a public right of way. \n\nUnlawful entry upon private land or a restricted area and/or wilful damage of property such as gates and fences expose offenders to legal prosecution. \nInitial Publication Date31/07/2019Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

It is divided into the seven themes of the FSDF and two categories Each of these themes is made up of various Feature Classes (or layers) that contain the relevant spatial data and their associated attributes and relationships. This dataset was captured by utilising the best available source at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m.A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:3857WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Terms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and Specification\nOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms. This dataset is compliant with the NSW Foundation Spatial Data Framework and its specifications.Data CustodianDCS Spatial Services346 Panorama AveBathurst NSW 2795Point of ContactPlease contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data AggregatorDCS Spatial Services346 Panorama AveBathurst NSW 2795Data DistributorDCS Spatial Services346 Panorama Ave Bathurst NSW 2795Additional Supporting Information<a href=\"https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/publications/information_sheets/data_dictionaries\">Data Dictionaries</a>TRIM Number",

The data spans the months of 2001 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

The hillshade was created in ArcMap using the 'hillshade' tool with an azmith of 315, an altitude of 45 and a vertical exaggeration of 5. The hillshade covers the full extent of Christmas Island. The hillshade image can be viewed as a greyscale image, or underneath the DEM (if semi-transparent). It can also be viewed under any other layer to show the lie of the land, for example orthophotography, canopy heights or infrastructure.\nThe hillshade was created from the 2011 DEM which is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Resident Population (ERP) by number of households and number of dwellings for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2011 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for LGAs and Victoria in Future Small Areas (VIFSA) for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

Hydraulic modelling of some of the flood modification options\nwas undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of those options that would involve\nsignificant capital expenditure.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n This study examined the features of Australian wild dog management groups, particularly in terms of landholder participation and collaboration, to identify what helps or hinders the groups in achieving coordinated and effective wild dog management. The study was based on interviews with representatives from 30 groups across Australia. \r\n\r\n This work was undertaken as part of a broader ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n\r\n The study found that as well as reduced losses from wild dog attacks, the operations of many groups have resulted in more strategic and targeted control actions and better communication between neighbours. Wild dog management groups function as important social networks that help farming communities cope with the detrimental effects of wild dogs. The report makes suggestions about the support that groups may need in future to achieve wild dog management. \r\n\r\n The study findings have been used in the design of a national landholder survey on wild dog management, which ABARES conducted in late 2014.

    "description": "This data was collected in May 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS042010.\n\nDeparted: \tPort Hedland, Australia, May 8, 2010\nArrived:  \tFremantle, Australia, May 27, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The data spans the months of 2011 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

This includes metallics, industrial minerals and construction materials, but excludes  oil, gas and groundwater resources which are recorded in OILGAS and BORES datasets. OILGAS will be available for external users within Petroleum Mapshare. It is thought that groundwater resources will be available to external users within a CLPR (Catchment and Land Protection) Mapshare View. \n\nThe data is derived from Minerals and Petroleums RDBMS, which is known as VICMINE.\nInformation on each site has been compiled mostly from historical literature, with only selected major sites visited in the field.\n\nNOTES CONCERNING GEOVIC \"Mines and Mineral Occurrence\" DISPLAY\n\nThe type of mine/mineral occurrence displayed varies with the scale of the map view.\nMajor and Intermediate  size mines are displayed at all scales.\nMinor and Unknown size  Mines are displayed at scales ranging from 1:1 to 1:500,000\nMAJOR is for mine_size greater than= 85000000\nMINOR is for mine_size less than 8500000\nINTERMEDIATE is for mine_size between the two\nUNKNOWN is when the mine_size is unknown\n\nMINE_SIZE (better name would be MINE_VALUE) is a calculated dollar amount based on the total production and resource for each commodity multiplied by the commodity price (NOTE: these commodity prices have not been updated in some time eg: as of 13/1/2013 the gold price per ounce used was $526.70 - April 1985 prices) \n\nNOTES CONCERNING GEOVIC \"Deposit Styles\" DISPLAY\n\nA number of deposit style layers exist in GeoVic.\nThe layers are based on particular values of the dep_style attribute - within this dataset.\nThe dep_style attribute contains the results of classifying the mineral deposits of Victoria east of approximately 142°30' and west of 145°30', but excluding the Willaura (7422) 1:100 000 map sheet area.  The classification is described in detail in Moore, D.H., 2007. \"Classifying gold deposits in central and western Victoria, Australia. GeoScience Victoria Gold Undercover Report\".  \n\nGENERAL NOTES CONCERNING GEOVIC\n\nRefer to Mineral Regions 1M (MINERAL) for extent of brown and black coal fields, Heavy Mineral Sands 1M (MINSAND1M) for extent of strandline mineral sand deposits, and Heavy Minerals Sands WIM 1M (MINSAND1M) for extent of WIM style mineral sand deposits.",

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in Nirranda South using eddy covariance techniques.   \nThe Otway flux station was located at Narrinda South in south west Victoria, Australia.The pasture was grazed by dairy cattle with average grass height of 0.1m. Annual average rainfall at the site was around 800mm and was only moderately seasonal. Mean daily temperature ranged from 25°C in February to 12°C in July. The flux station was situated on a 10m tower. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide were measured using the open-path eddy covariance technique. Supplementary measurements included temperature, humidity, rainfall, total solar, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and net radiation. Soil temperature and heat flux were also measured. The Otway flux station was established in February 2007 on private land at Nirranda South and managed by CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research staff as part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies.For additional site information, see http://www.ozflux.org.au/monitoringsites/otway/index.html .

    "title": "Central Great Barrier Reef shark nursery area survey (NERP TE 6.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset contains the catch data from seasonal gillnet and longline surveys of shark nursery areas in the Central Section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (2011-2014). \n\n\nMethods:\n\nSampling occurred seasonally in nine bays along ~ 400 km of the tropical north Queensland coastline: Rockingham, Halifax, Cleveland, Bowling Green, Upstart, Abbott, Edgecumbe, Woodwark/Double and Repulse Bays. Of these nine bays, five were sampled regularly, the others (in italics) were sampled only once as part of a broader survey. Sampling sites were dominated by silty substrates, and mudflat and/or mangrove-lined foreshores. Between October 2011 and November 2013 eight rounds of fisheries-independent surveys were undertaken to collect data on the shark community across the study region. Within each bay sampling occurred randomly within sixteen 0.9 km wide strips running perpendicular to the shore. Two groups of eight strips were placed within each bay to spread the sampling across different habitat types and management zones (i.e. gill-net fishing allowed and gill-net fishing prohibited) where possible. During each round, each bay was sampled over four days allowing for two days of sampling in each group of strips. The bays vary in size and so the relative proportion of area sampled varied between bays.\n\nTwo methods were used to sample across a broad range of shark sizes. During a total of 183 days of sampling, 453 longline shots and 343 gill-net shots were deployed totaling 370 and 310 h, respectively. Bottom-set gill-nets, comprised of 11-cm-stretched mesh, were deployed for ~ 1 h and checked every 15 min to facilitate tagging and release. In accordance with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority¿s Dugong Protection Areas, multiple panels of net were joined to create a total net length of either 200 m or 400 m. In addition, some 100-m gill-nets were used during the Jan/Feb round in 2012. Bottom-set longlines were comprised of 800 m of 6-mm nylon mainline with an anchor and float at both ends. Gangions were attached to the mainline ~ 8¿10 m apart; and were comprised of 1 m of 4-mm nylon cord, 1 m of 1.5-mm wire leader, and a baited 14/0 Mustad tuna circle hook. A variety of fresh and frozen baits were used including butterfly bream (Nemipterus sp.), squid (Loligo sp.), blue threadfin (Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and mullet (Mugil cephalus). Up to two longlines were deployed simultaneously for 40¿90 min sets. Environmental data (water temperature, salinity, depth, turbidity and oxygen saturation) were recorded for all sets.\n\nCaptured sharks were identified to species level, tagged on the first dorsal fin (Rototag or Superflex tag; Dalton, Oxfordshire, UK), measured, sexed, assessed for clasper calcification, examined for umbilical scar condition, and released at their capture site. Stretch total length was determined according to Compagno (1984). Small sharks (? 1 m) were placed ventral side down on a measuring board and measured to the nearest mm with the upper lobe of the caudal fin depressed in line with the body axis. Larger sharks were secured beside the boat and measured to the nearest cm using a measuring tape. Additional measurements of fork length and pre-caudal length were recorded.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nCSV File, 4432 rows (~1MB), Shapefiles (4409 Points)\n\nEach line of data represents the catch of an individual shark, ray, fish, etc. Multiple lines exist per shot if more than one animal was caught. \n\nThe shapefile was created by the eAtlas for visualisation purposes. It retains most of the information in the CSV as a point shapefile. The point shapefile was created from the CSV using the Start_Lat and Start_Long as the coordinate for points. If rows which did not have a valid Start_Lat or Start_Long (29 rows) then the End_Lat and End_Long were used instead (6 rows). If neither of these were available then the row was ignored. This removed 23 rows. Attributes Lat and Long were added to contain the coordinates used in the shapefile, leaving the original start and end coordinates untouched.\n\n\nData Dictionary:\n\nNote: The attribute names in rounded brackets () correspond to the name in the shapefile version of the data. These names were adjusted to fit within the 10 character limit of shapefile attributes.\n\n- Shot_Code: Unique identifier for each gear shot.\n- Bay_Code: Bay identifier (AB ¿ Abbott Bay; BG ¿ Bowling Green Bay; CB ¿ Cleveland Bay; ED ¿ Edgcombe Bay; HB ¿ Halifax Bay; RE ¿ Repulse Bay; RO ¿ Rockingham Bay; UP ¿ Upstart Bay; WD ¿ Woodwark/Double Bay)\n- Round: Round identifier.

    "description": "The overall aims were to provide data on the distribution of deep seabed habitats and fauna that are amenable to scientific hypothesis testing, can be immediately applied to marine resource management processes, and that enable strategic development of tools and techniques for understanding the processes that maintain deep sea biodiversity. This work was to support the process of NWR Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories, distribution maps and conservation values. Data will be collected at scientific reference sites from potential MPA areas that can be re-visited for monitoring purposes in the future. Sampling along environmental gradients (geographic range and depth) in this section of Australia's coast will also provide the opportunity to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses. Further refinement of predictive methods for identifying seabed habitat types, initially developed in temperate and cool-temperate environments, will be enabled by data collection from this tropical location in Australia. We intended to highlight the importance of this underlying science as a modern 'Voyage of Discovery' given the likely significance of the findings in terms of Australia's biodiversity and its biogeography and evolution. (From Voyage Plan)\n\nThis record describes the video and still imagery collected with the CSIRO deep-towed camera system. Imagery has not been systematically annotated or scored.  The associated videos and still images have been archived as described in MarLIN record 14436 'Benthic Habitats Video Image Archive'",

    "title": "Banks – Liabilities",
    "description": "These data are derived from returns submitted to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) by banks authorised under the Banking Act 1959. APRA assumed responsibility for the supervision and regulation of banks on 1 July 1998. Data prior to that date were submitted to the RBA.\r\n\r\nUp to and including June 2000, data are averages of weekly (Wednesday) figures. From July 2000, data are for the last business day of every month. Up to and including March 2002, banks submitted Form D (Statement of Liabilities and Assets on the Australian Books). In March 2002, APRA implemented new reporting forms for banks. The data, dating from April 2002, are derived from ARF 320.0 Statement of Financial Position (Domestic Books).\r\n\r\nARF 320.0 covers the domestic books of the licensed bank and is an unconsolidated report of the Australian bank’s operations/transactions that are booked or recorded inside Australia (with Australian residents and non-residents). ARF 320.0 does not consolidate Australian and offshore-controlled entities (thus offshore branches of the Australian bank are excluded). ARF 320.0 includes transactions of Australian-based offshore banking units of the licensed ADI but excludes transactions of overseas-based offshore banking units.\r\n\r\nAn Australian ‘resident’ is any individual, business or other organisation domiciled in Australia. Australian branches and subsidiaries of foreign businesses are regarded as Australian residents. A ‘non-resident’ is any individual, business or other organisation domiciled overseas. Foreign branches and subsidiaries of Australian businesses are regarded as non-residents.\r\n\r\n‘Resident liabilities – deposits’ include: transaction and non-transaction deposit accounts; and certificates of deposit. From April 2002, this item includes both Australian dollar- and foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) deposits. Prior to that date foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) deposits are included in ‘resident liabilities – other liabilities’. Certificates of deposit relate to both residents and non-residents.\r\n\r\n‘Resident liabilities – bill acceptances’ refers to liabilities arising from undertakings by banks to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. From April 2002, this item includes both Australian dollar- and foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) bill acceptances. Prior to that date foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) bill acceptances are included in ‘resident liabilities – other liabilities’.\r\n\r\nPrior to April 2002, ‘resident liabilities – other borrowings’ refers to Australian dollar-denominated items only and includes: balances (other than deposits) to overseas banks not authorised in Australia; issues of term subordinated debt; and loan capital and similar instruments. From April 2002, this item includes: Australian dollar- and foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) other borrowings; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; promissory notes and commercial paper; other short-term debt securities; bonds; notes; and long-term borrowings.\r\n\r\n‘Resident liabilities – other liabilities’ refers to all other resident liabilities not included in the above items. Prior to April 2002, this item includes: all provision accounts other than those relating to bad and doubtful debts; accounts payable and prepayments received; gold bullion borrowings that are repayable in physical gold; credit balances resulting from netting of all deferred tax liabilities and tax benefit accounts; cheques drawn by a bank on itself but not yet presented; and all other resident liabilities on banks’ Australian books other than retained earnings and shareholders’ funds, accrued interest not yet payable and inter-branch accounts. From April 2002, this item includes: liabilities due to clearing houses and due to financial institutions in relation to the payments system; income tax liabilities; provisions for dividends, employee entitlements, non-lending losses, restructuring costs and other; creditor and related liabilities; and loan capital and hybrid securities. Note that, from April 2002, this item also includes: accrued interest not yet payable; inter-branch transfers; and unrealised losses on trading derivatives – prior to that date, these were excluded.\r\n\r\n‘Resident liabilities – total’ refers to total liabilities on the Australian books of banks that are due to residents, and is the sum of the above items. ‘Resident liabilities – of which: denominated in foreign currency’ refers to the Australian dollar equivalent of ‘resident liabilities –  total’ on the Australian books of banks that are denominated in foreign currency.\r\n\r\n‘Non-resident liabilities – total’ refers to total liabilities on the Australian books of banks that are due to non-residents, though from April 2002, this series excludes the total amount due to banks’ overseas operations, which have been separately identified on the new reporting form. ’Non-resident liabilities – of which: denominated in foreign currency’ refers to the Australian dollar equivalent of ‘non-resident liabilities – total’ on the Australian books of banks that are denominated in foreign currency.\r\n\r\n‘Total liabilities’ is the sum of ‘resident liabilities – total’ and ‘non-resident liabilities –  total’. From April 2002, this item also includes the ‘amount due to overseas operations’, which is identified separately from ‘resident liabilities – total’ and ‘non-resident liabilities –  total’. The ‘amount due to overseas operations’ refers to domestic book on-balance sheet liabilities due to the overseas operations of banks that have not been included in the above items\r\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nContains the files and R scripts used for creating interpolated surfaces of depth to groundwater and contour maps of piezometric surfaces for dry (200 - 2007) and wet (2008 - 2012) periods in the Bremer, Clarence Lockyer, Logan-Albert and Richmond alluvial systems.  Piezometric surfaces and depth to groundwater surfaces are created using ordinary kriging in R.  The data used come from the bores in the QLD and NSW groundwater databases (see data lineage).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGroundwater hydraulic head data from the NSW and QLD databases (see data lineage) was extracted by selecting only those data collected between 2000 and 2012 and that fell within the boundary shapefiles for the alluvial bodies.  Elevation data from the DEM was appended to the spatial locations for each groundwater bore in the dataset.  Ordinary kriging was then performed in R to create interpolated surfaces for depth to groundwater and piezometric surfaces.  The kriging makes use of the digital elevation model as a covariate for aiding prediction.  The R scripts output pdf maps of the surfaces for each of the following alluvial systems: Bremer, Clarence, Lockyer, Logan-Albert and Richmond.  Maps are produced for for the dry period (2000 - 2007) and wet period (2008 - 2012) and show the predicted surface in addition to the prediction standard deviation.\n\n\n\nThe R script also outputs the rasters used to create these maps to .asc files (ascii grids).  There are four such ascii grids for the entire alluvium: \n\n1. PiezometricSurface_Dry.asc  (the estimated piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the dry years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n2. PiezometricSurface_SD_Dry.asc (the estimated standard deviation of the piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the dry years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n3. PiezometricSurface_Wet.asc (the estimated piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the wet years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n4. PiezometricSurface_SD_Wet.asc (the estimated standard deviation of the piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the wet years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) CLM - Interpolated piezometric surfaces for Alluvium.
