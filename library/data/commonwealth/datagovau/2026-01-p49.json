    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months from January 2020 to June 2021 and includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "The lesser hairy­footed dunnart (<i>Sminthopsis youngsoni, Dasyuridae</i>) is a generalist marsupial insectivore in arid Australia, but consumes wolf spiders (<i>Lycosa spp., Lycosidae</i>) disproportionately often relative to their availability. This project tested the hypothesis that this disproportionate predation is a product of frequent encounter rates between the interactants due to high overlap in their diets and use of space and time. This data set focuses on overlap in the use of different microhabitats of wolf spiders (<i>Lycosa spp.</i>) and the lesser hairy­footed dunnart (<i>Sminthopsis youngsoni</i>) in the Simpson Desert, south­western Queensland Australia. Microhabitat use was determined by estimating the percentage cover of seven microhabitat variables and distance to nearest cover along trails left by individuals of each species­ group and a randomly orientated (control) trail for each actual trail as a measure of the availability of each microhabitat within the local environment. Trail length was also recorded and data was collected across 16 trapping grids at Main Camp during July and October (winter and Spring) in 2017. Differences in microhabitat use between trail types (actual vs control) and species (lycosids vs dunnarts) were assessed using non­metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutational analyses of variance (PERMANOVA). These analyses were performed using this data.",

    "description": "    \n\nDefinition: Mean annual dissolved concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil\nwater (mg of nitrogen per kg of water), averaged for both soil layers.\nInterpretation: The dissolved N concentration is calculated as the ratio of\nthe mineral N store to soil water store, which assumes that all the mineral N\nis in solution. Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these\nstores, but not on their ratio. The pattern of mineral N concentrations is\nexplained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N\nstore (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air\ndryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy\nlimitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that\ndecreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-\narid tropical environments. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes (1) current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation; (2) current agricultural inputs of nutrients\n(nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertiliser, legume crops, and legume pastures;\n(3) current nutrient offtakes by product removal (harvest, stock).\nNMnlConc0.Agric a Mean annual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water\n(mgN kgH2O-1) in the aAgrica (present day) scenario NMnlConc0.Base a Mean\nannual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water (mgN kgH2O-1) in the\naBasea (pre-1788) scenario Data is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_cmnswr9cl\n__02811a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The museum’s collection dates back to 1854 and comprises natural sciences (including zoological, palaeontological, and geological specimens) and humanities (including indigenous cultures, history and technology collections). The museum cares for an estimated 17 million items, many of which are grouped together as a single entry in the electronic cataloguing system. \nThe MV Collections website provides access to over 1.15 million records, representing items in the Humanities collection; specimens in the Sciences collection; articles written about significant people, places and parts of the collection; and species profiles written about animals that can be observed in the wild. A search may deliver results across items, species, specimens or article records. Results can be refined by adding a new search term to the existing query, or by using the supplied filters.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2008.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "The EAC5 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.1 S, 155.3 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015.  \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "Tropical rainforests play a powerful role in mediating the global climate through the exchange and storage of carbon and water.  Climate change is expected to generate higher atmospheric water demand in many areas, potentially increasing the rate of evaporation.  In this study, we show that higher evaporative demand may in fact lead to lower fluxes of water from tropical rainforests and a reduced capacity of these forests to store carbon.\n\nThe record contains meteorological and forest inventory data in addition to data on soil water potential, sapflow measurements and tree hydraulic vulnerability measures from Robson Creek and Cow Bay study sites in Far North Queensland. The measurements occurred over a period of two years form 2019 to 2020.",

    "description": "SandMap Pty Ltd has been contracted by Moreton Bay Regional Council to undertake investigation\nsurveys into multiple sites located close offshore from the Redcliffe Peninsula, QLD. These surveys will\ninform coastal modelling currently being undertaken as part of coastal design projects and may also\nbe used to set-out coastal protection structures such as groyne extensions and seawalls encroaching\nbelow the low tide mark. \n\nThe survey requirements were to provide enough coverage within marked survey extents and high\npriority areas for each site to capture key bed features and the toe of any coastal structures up to\n-0.5m AHD. Additionally, the fringes of reefs within the marked areas were to be captured. To\nsupplement this data, a number of survey profiles were specified for capture. The survey to be carried\nout to Class D requirements.\n\nThis site, Woody Point, refers to a 2.2km x 0.6km long section of coastline on the southern tip of the\nRedcliffe Peninsula and incorporates the Woody Point jetty. The survey area as identified through the\nspecifications, including profiles, is contained within an area of 1.9km by 1.6km.",

This includes each compulsory and elective English class for secondary students held during the week of the census. Secondary students not studying English are NOT counted in the class size return. Also included are classes (such as Remedial English or ESL / English as a Second Language) that a student attends instead of compulsory English. Excluded are classes such as English Literature, Remedial English or ESL that a student attends as well as “compulsory” English.

The project includes:\n<ul><li>a new web portal to make it easier for the community to report wombats to capture where in the landscape healthy and unhealthy populations of wombats are occurring and so wildlife volunteers can quickly assess treatment options available.(please contact access Canberra for wildlife injured on our roads requiring immediate attention)</li><li>a new spatial support tool that maps wombat populations to help us understand the extent of mange and its effects on populations and to facilitate coordinated monitoring and treatment</li><li>an innovative research effort that will trial the remote delivery of a more effective and longer lasting mange treatment ACT Wildlife and Wombat Rescue are partnering with government on the project in an excellent example of how government and community volunteers can work together for good outcomes for a species in trouble. The University of Tasmania is providing advice from its own research and trials.</li></ul>\n\nThe wombat mange project progresses a commitment under the Parliamentary Agreement of the 10th Legislative Assembly to fund ACT Wildlife to undertake mange treatment in the ACT. Collaboratively, the ACT Government and community volunteers will deliver a coordinated and comprehensive mange treatment program across the ACT.\n\nThe project is part of a wider wombat management project being developed within ACT Government.

    "description": "This dataset and accompanying RMarkdown notebook document the analysis and efforts to consolidate spatial data on coastal protection structures, such as sea walls, groynes, and wharfs, across Australia's coastline. The project addresses the urgent need for a national-level dataset by sourcing data from various state governments and identifying gaps in coverage. The dataset integrates contributions from OpenStreetMap (OSM), Smartline, and state-based government databases, resulting in a research-quality geospatial file. Key attributes include the location and type of coastal structures, with data standardised for consistency across regions. Limitations are noted, such as the absence of government-supplied data for certain regions and potential accuracy issues with OSM-sourced information. The dataset is intended for research purposes, supporting efforts to assess coastal risks and guide future protection measures. Ongoing updates to datasets will extend to not only consider engineered hard structures but also include datasets of nature-based coastal protection (e.g., restored reefs and coastal vegetation).",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2020 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "All government primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have school zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas).\nSchool zones were produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nSchool zones defined as metropolitan have taken preference over school zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of school zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some school zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website.\nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes the central part of the suburb of Picnic\nPoint. The northern part of the catchment is predominantly urban; the southern part includes parts of\nthe Georges River National Park, in particular the Yeramba Lagoon. The catchment drains gradually\nsouth, through a stormwater pipe network towards the Georges River. The Sydney South Electricity\nSubstation is also located within the Picnic Point catchment. The Picnic Point catchment is wholly\nwithin the southern section of Bankstown City Council Local Government Area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 170 stormwater pits and 200 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Picnic Point Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

    "description": "Remotely sensed topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) information were acquired for targeted sections of the NSW mid-north coast using Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB - a combination of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) sensors) during November - December 2013. This resource defines total area of 139 km2 of data covering areas around the locations of 1) Lake Cathie and 2) Old Bar. Data were acquired by Pelydryn Ltd on behalf of NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (now the Department of Planning and Environment) using a HawkEye IIb bathymetric LiDAR system aboard VH-CWG Aircraft. Funding was provided through NSW Office of Environment and Heritage to acquire high-quality, high-resolution baseline data to support coastal erosion studies. The survey requirement was to provide high-resolution data at a minimum of 5 x 5 m laser spot spacings from the mean high-water mark to ~200m inland, and from the shore, seaward (LADS - bathymetry) up to maximum ~5km offshore (~20-40m water depth depending on in-water conditions). Positioning data were collected on the ellipsoid ITRF 2014 GRS80 in UTM Z56 and post-processed using local base stations (CORSnet NSW) to provide a Post Processed Kinematic GNSS solution for final aircraft trajectory before being applied to all data. Data types available are as GeoTiff (L3) or classified LAS format point cloud (L2) issued transformed to GDA94 Z56. Other data types may be available as ESRI topo-bathy rasters and contours, tab delimited ascii XYZ, unclassified LAS format data, relative reflectance data (terrestrial, marine) and Quality Control (QC) documentation (contained within survey report) via the NSW DPE Information Asset Register (IAR) (metadata, coverage shape), SEED (https://seed.nsw.gov.au or upon request.  Users note: these surveys achieved maximum depths of ~15m and some artefacts may be apparent in the nearshore potentially associated with in-water conditions (i.e. algae; turbidity). The data are intended to inform coastal and marine management and are ‘not for navigation’.",

Janas (IMOS platform code: ZMTW).\n\nDeparted:  Hobart, Australia, August 26, 2009\nArrived:  \tNew Zealand, August 31, 2009\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "Data showing estimated lime application in Western Australia to treat acidifying soils, 2004-2016. Estimates are based on agricultural lime sales in WA (as supplied by Lime WA Inc).\r\n\r\nThe data shows the rate of lime use has continued to increase substantially in WA following consistent and sustained Research, Development and Extension projects promoting better management of soil acidity.\r\n\r\nNote: This data represents the aggregate agricultural lime sales figures for each year for the 2016 Lime WA members. The data demonstrates the WA trend (and is not an absolute figure of lime used per year in WA). Because the number of members changes overtime these figures, which have been restricted to current members, differ from those previously published. It is estimated that these current members represent approximately 80 percent of the total market share. \r\n\r\nFor related background information see: https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sites/gateway/files/Report%20card%20on%20sustainable%20natural%20resource%20use%20in%20agriculture%20-%20full%20report%20-%2025MB.pdf\r\n\r\nThe data has been used by the Department of Environment and Energy to produce Figure LAN18 in the Land theme of Australia State of the Environment 2016, available at \r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/land/topic/2016/soil-salinity-and-acidification#land-figure-LAN18\r\n",

Important results published in our 53-page Phys. Rev. X paper (2021) include the first measurements of higher-order light-propagation effects and of the relativistic deformation of the orbit and highlight the importance of a long term observational campaign, including VLBI observations, for this remarkable system. The main aims of this proposal are to provide the strongest tests to date for general relativity and to measure for the first time the moment-of-inertia of a neutron star. Additionally, we will determine the system geometry, map the pulsar beams via geodetic precession, and search for the reappearance of Pulsar B. We exploit the high sensitivity and broad bandwidth of the UWL receiver. We are collaborating with the MeerKAT Double Pulsar Timing team to optimise combination of MeerKAT and UWL data.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2017 car parking event data there are 3,858 records where the parking event goes into 2018 and ends at midnight.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/u9sa-j86i.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.13GB, 35.9 million rows)",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

Two sites WB 72 and WB73 were located by way of x and y coordinates supplied by GPS survey. Site WB 30 was located by local knowledge of the sites. Location of bores should fall within accuracy ± 20m.\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.  \n\nEach mooring is equipped with surface CO2 systems, using proven and robust technology.  Three sensors will determine surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. \n\nAcidification moorings are co-located at three National Reference Stations:\n* the Yongala NRS in Queensland (replaced in September 2013 after Tropical Cyclone Yasi) (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and a WETLabs WQM)\n* the Maria Island NRS in Tasmania (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT), and\n* the Kangaroo Island NRS in South Australia (removed in June 2013, and redeployed in May 2014) (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT).  \n\nA fourth acidification mooring is located adjacent to the Heron Island reef slope in the Wistari channel on the Great Barrier Reef (instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT).  \n\nThe Yongala, Wistari and Maria Island acidification moorings are located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean.  The Kangaroo Island mooring monitors the deeper waters upwelled on the South Australian shelf which are expected to have higher CO2 and thus could accelerate the exposure of ecosystems to acidification earlier than in other regions.",

Contract Notice Export\nfiles remain available on AusTender for a period of eighteen (18) months.\n\nYou can find the historical contract data dating back to 1999 at\n[http://data.gov.au/dataset/historical-australian-government-contract-\ndata/](http://data.gov.au/dataset/historical-australian-government-contract-\ndata/)\n\n**Please note that the data contained within each CN Export file is correct at the time of extraction. Data may change over time as agencies undertake data quality assurance processes or as contract information is varied. Please refer to the tenders website below for the latest of each week.**\n\n**Note: **As part of the implementation of the new Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs), Procurement Method descriptions for Contract and Standing Offer Notices reported on AusTender changed, effective 1 July 2012. Open, Select and Direct are now Open Tender, Prequalified Tender, and Limited Tender, respectively. For Contract Notice Export files extracted prior to 1 July 2012, Procurement Method descriptions are unchanged.\n\nSource of information at [http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.lis\ntCNWeeklyExport](http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.listCNWeeklyE\nxport)\n\n**UPDATE:** Now below is also the current list of goods and services category codes used by Australian Government agencies to code their open approaches to market and contracts awarded for publication on AusTender. The codeset is a subset of the United Nations Standard Product and Services Code (UNSPSC) and is reviewed and updated periodically. Code numbers starting with the prefixes **43 a Information Technology, Broadcasting and Telecommunications** and **81 a Engineering and Research and Technology Based Services** apply in the main to Information and Communications Technology related contracts, primarily ICT goods and services respectively.\n\n_Please note: we will make an API available to this dataset in the near\nfuture_.\n\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for lamb producers for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Lamb producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that sold, on average, 200 or more lambs for slaughter a year over the three years ending 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income of lamb producing farms rose on average over the period 2013-14 to 2014-15. The majority of the rise in farm incomes came from higher beef and lamb receipts due to increased prices and sales for both commodities. Average farm cash income of lamb producing farms is estimated to have increased further in 2015-16 mainly as a result of increased crop, wool and beef cattle sales. \r\n• Average incomes of lamb producing farms are estimated to have risen from 2014-15 to 2015-16 in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The majority of the increase in farm incomes in these states was from higher cropping receipts. \r\n• In real terms, the estimated average farm incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 were among the highest recorded since 2001-02. \r\n• Rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for lamb producers fell marginally from 2.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 2.5 per cent in 2014-15. The average rate of return is estimated to have increased in 2015-16 to around 3.0 per cent, reflecting higher incomes. \r\n• Average debt for lamb producers increased in real terms by around 88 per cent from $323 000 in 2000-01 (in 2015-16 dollars) to an estimated $605 000 in 2015-16. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of increases in average farm size and borrowing for land purchase, as well as for ongoing working capital. \r\n• Overall, changes in average debt over time have been modest relative to lamb producers' capacity to service debt by generating income. On average, around 8 per cent of lamb producers' farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments over the 10 years to 2015-16. In 2015-16 an estimated 6 per cent of farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments. \r\n",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal.

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.5.0) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe site is woodland savanna with an overstory co-dominated by tree species <em>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</em>, <em>Corymbia latifolia</em>, <em>Terminalia grandiflora</em>, <em>Sorghum sp.</em> and <em>Heteropogon triticeus</em>. Average canopy height measures 16.4&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is close to 110&nbsp; m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site is 1,170&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 31.2 &nbsp;°C (in June) to 37.5&nbsp;°C (in October), while minimum temperatures range from 12.6&nbsp;°C (in July) to 23.8&nbsp;°C (in January). Maximum temperatures range seasonally by 6.3&nbsp;°C and minimum temperatures by 11.2&nbsp;°C. The instrument mast is 23&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy.Ancillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the site in September 2008. ",

    "description": "AUV Sirius (IMOS Platform code: SIRIUS) was deployed near Batemans Bay in New South Wales, November 2011.\n\nDives in New South Wales were coordinated around existing BRUVs locations maintained by DECCW and the Batemans' Bay MPA.  Broad grids and dense patch surveys were completed at each site, although an issue with the vessel, a fault with the vehicle’s battery and weather meant that not all sites were completed at Port Stephens.  We are looking to complete these in early 2011.The 2010/11 period has predominantly been spent establishing benthic reference sites at numerous sites around Australia using the AUV.\n\nThe SIRIUS overtook 13 dives and travelled for 36 kms. 79296 stereo pairs images were captured every around each 40cm at an average altitude of 2.2m.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trip the dataset included over 1TB of geotiff imagery, multibeam, AUV tracks, 3D textured meshes and hydrographical data (CDOM, Salinity, Temperature, .\n\nThe dive reports from this campaign summarise AUV activity during each dive.",

    "description": "This record describes the CTD data collected on Investigator voyage IN2025_V04, titled: \"Untangling the causes of change over 25 years in the southeast marine ecosystem - Voyage IV (SEA-MES Voyage 4).\" The voyage took place between May 27, 2025 and June 28, 2025 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart.\nData for 61 CTD deployments were acquired using the Sea-Bird SBE911 CTD unit #22, fitted with 36 twelve-litre bottles on the rosette sampler. Sea-Bird-supplied calibration factors were used to compute the pressures and preliminary conductivity values. CSIRO-supplied calibrations were applied to the temperature data. The data were subjected to automated QC to remove spikes and out-of-range values.\nMajority of casts were bottom approaches to 10m off bottom, some casts did not approach the bottom due to the operators deciding that conditions were too risky to attempt a bottom approach. The test cast was not attempted due to strong winds, hence cast #01 was a scientific cast.\nCast #61 no SUNA data is available for this cast.\nBetween cast #35 and #36 the pumped sensors were cleaned with freshwater. This did not affect the conductivity sensor but did the oxygen sensor, hence the final calibrations were based on a single deployment group for conductivity and multiple deployment groupings for oxygen. The final conductivity calibration from the secondary sensor had a standard deviation (SD) of 0.0030364 PSU, outside our target of ‘better than 0.002 PSU’. The standard product of 1-decibar binned averages were produced using data from the secondary sensors. The dissolved oxygen data calibration fit had a SD of 0.68397μM (#01-#35) and 0.79591μM (#36-#61). The agreement between the CTD and bottle data was good.\nPAR, CDOM, Transmissometer, Chlorophyll-a and Scattering sensors were also installed on the auxiliary A/D channels of the CTD.\nThe collected data were processed (quality-controlled), and subsequently archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).\nAdditional information regarding this dataset may be contained in the Voyage Summary and the Data Processing Report.",

    "description": "This dataset consists of one data file (spreadsheet) from a 2 week aquarium experiment manipulating pH (pCO2) changes and measuring photosynthetic and growth responses of three tropical seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii). \n\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased pCO2 would increase photosynthetic and growth rates to various extents between seagrass species.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nThis experiment exposed three seagrass species, Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii, to four pCO2 treatments (440, 700, 890, 1204 µatm) for two weeks to investigate the effects of acidification on their physiology. These treatments were chosen to bracket the range of atmospheric CO2 levels predicted for different end-of-century emission scenarios in the near-future (2100). Each treatment was replicated across four aquaria, each with 2 duplicate pots per species.\n\nC. serrulata and H. uninervis were collected from the intertidal meadow at Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef (19°10.88¿S, 146°50.63¿E) in late March 2013. T. hemprichii was collected from Green Island in the Northern Great Barrier Reef (16°45.37¿S, 145°58.19¿E) in early April 2013. H. uninervis and sediment was collected as intact plugs. C. serrulata and T. hemprichii were collected by excavating intact shoots with connected horizontal rhizomes from the sediment. The experiment started two to four weeks after the collection.\n\nPhotosynthetic rates and respiration of the second youngest leaf of a haphazardly chosen shoot from each pot were measured using optical oxygen sensors. Photosynthetic rates were measured over a series of light steps (10, 30, 70, 110, 220, 400, 510 µmol m-2 s-1), with each light step lasting 20 minutes. Rates were normalised to the dry weight of the leaf, after drying leaves at 60°C for 48 hours. To determine photosynthetic parameters (Pmax, alpha, Ek, Ec), photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-E) data plots were fitted to the adapted hyperbolic tangent model equation of Jassby and Platt (1976). Net productivity (NP) was taken to be the photosynthetic rate measured at the experimental light level (400 µmol m-2 s-1). Energetic surplus (PG:R) was calculated as the ratio of gross productivity to dark respiration rate. \n\nTo measure growth rates, all shoots were marked at the top of the sheath with a needle at the start of the experiment. After 14 days, the shoots were harvested, the length of new tissue growth were excised, dried at 60°C for 48 hours and weighed for determination of weight of new leaf growth. Leaf tissue growth was normalised to the aboveground biomass to derive relative leaf growth rates (RGR). Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated by dividing total leaf area with the total biomass of the leaves.\n\nChlorophyll content was determined by acetone extraction of chlorophyll from a young mature leaf from each pot at the end of the experiment. \nTo determine non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content, roots and rhizomes were dried at 60°C for 48 hours, before being homogenised. Soluble carbohydrates were extracted with 80% ethanol at 80°C. The amount of soluble carbohydrates was assayed after removal of phenolic compounds and acid hydrolysis. Starch content was analysed from the residue of the soluble carbohydrate extraction through enzyme (amylase and amyloglucosidase) digestion. The concentration of glucose is measured using a commercially available glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) testing reagent (Megazyme). Absorbance was then measured at 510 nm. Total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content was the sum of the amount of soluble carbohydrates and starch content.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nComma Separated File (CSV)\n\n\nData Dictionary:\n\nseagrass_pCO2only.csv:\n\n- pH: Average of the calculated pH of the aquarium over the experimental period.\n- pCO2 (uatm): average pCO2 levels over two weeks.\n- Temp_real (oC): Average of measured temperatures of the aquarium over the experimental period (N=3).

The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe data set consists of two files which correspond to the wells location and data (formation markers) used to identify the depth of formations used in the geologic model. \n\n\n\nFiles:\n\nWell_picks.txt\n\n\n\nContains the well name, datum and the calculated depths of formations form the datum identified from the well completion reports.\n\n\n\nWells_locations.kmz \n\n\n\nContains the locations for use in GoogleEarth.  Geographic coordinates are available in the original well completion reports.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nData were extracted from 25 well completion reports obtained for the Gloucester basin from the DIGS database.  Each report lists the depth of the various formations encountered during well drilling and the elevation at the surface.  Using these values the formation tops and bottoms were calculated and formatted accordingly for input into the geological model.  The file well_picks.txt represents the input data.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) GLO Deep Well Locations and Depths of Formations V01.

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in southeast of Emerald, Queensland, using eddy covariance techniques.   \nThe Arcturus greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring station was established in July 2010, 48 km southeast of Emerald, Queensland, with flux tower measurements starting in June 2011 until early 2014. The station was part of a collaborative project between Geoscience Australia (GA) and CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR). Elevation of the site was approximately 170m asl and mean annual precipitation was 572mm. The tower bordered 2 land use types split N-S: To the west lightly forested tussock grasslands; To the east crop lands, cycling through fallow periods.The instruments were installed on a square lattice tower with an adjustable pulley lever system to raise and lower the instrument arm. The tower was 5.6m tall with the instrument mast extending a further 1.1m above, totalling a height of 6.7m. Fluxes of heat, water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide were measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy included temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, and the 4 components of net radiation. Soil heat flux, soil moisture and soil temperature measurements were also collected.  \nFor additional site information, see http://www.ozflux.org.au/monitoringsites/arcturus/index.html.

    "description": "    \n\nThis statistical table brings together aggregate data for banks, credit\nunions, building societies, corporations covered by the Financial Sector\n(Collection of Data) Act 2001 (known as Registered Financial Corporations\n(RFCs)) and other significant parts of the financial sector for which\naggregate data are published by the RBA, the ABS and APRA.\n\nCare should be exercised in drawing conclusions about relative sizes and rates\nof growth of institutions because of the different nature of their activities\nand different coverage of the various data collections. Coverage differences\ninclude: timing (e.g. most bank data are monthly averages until June 2000 and\nend-month thereafter); valuation; location (e.g. life office data before 1988\nonly covers assets in Australia, most other collections include overseas\nassets); and netting out of transactions within some groups. Coverage of some\nseries changes over time: in recent years aggregates for individual groups\nhave been significantly affected by conversion of non-banks to banks,\nreclassification between RFC categories and changes to reporting forms. Some\nfurther details of coverage can be obtained from statistical files dealing\nwith the relevant institutions.\n\naReserve Bank (RBA)a data for June 1996 adjusted for change in accounting\npolicy.\n\naBanks (other than RBA)a: up to 1985 inclusive refers to A$ assets in\nAustralia only. From 1989 equals the totals shown in statistical table B2.\n\naOther authorised deposit-taking institutionsa excludes some ADIs, including\nSCCIs. Data from December 1999 inclusive are drawn from APRAas quarterly\nreturn. These data will differ from the total assets figures presented in\nstatistical tables B7 and B8 because they include assets of all building\nsocieties and credit unions, whereas statistical tables B7 and B8 only include\ndata for building societies and credit unions with total assets greater than\nor equal to $50 million.\n\nFrom December 1999 data, aRFCsa cover registered corporations whose assets in\nAustralia (including related corporations) exceed $50 million. Prior to\nDecember 1999, this threshold was set at $5 million. In April 2003,\nresponsibility for the collection of financial statistics from RFCs was\ntransferred from the RB to APRA. Prior to April 2003, these data were\ncollected by the RB under the now repealed Financial Corporations Act 1974.\nThese changes have resulted in breaks in all series covering RFCs at April\n2003. aFinance companies and general financiersa includes corporations\nformerly registered as Category E (Pastoral Finance Companies), F (Finance\nCompanies) and G (General Financiers) under the Financial Corporations Act\n1974.\n\nThe assets of life offices and superannuation funds and other managed funds\nhave been consolidated by the ABS. As a result, these data should not be\ncompared to statistical tables B14aB18, which contain unconsolidated data.\n\naGeneral insurance officesa include both private and public sector offices.\nData are sourced from the ABS Financial Accounts and relate to financial\nassets only.\n\naSecuritisation vehiclesa (commonly referred to as issuers of asset-backed\nsecurities) are special purpose vehicles set up to securitise selected assets,\nincluding residential mortgages. Many of the securities issued by these\nvehicles are held by other institutions shown in the table. More detailed data\nare shown in statistical table B19.\n\n",

    "description": "Historical Imagery 1955\nCurrent and historic imagery form an important part of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data Framework and provide a valuable resource which is widely accessed by government and the broader community on a daily basis. As the completeness of this data base continues, its market demand also increases across a broad range of applications.\nSpatial Services aerial imagery was originally captured using a veriety of cameras includeing the Wild RC-5, RC-10 and Leica RC-30 cameras with a variety of lenses with focal lengths of 88mm, 153mm and 304mm. Images were captured in monochrome or colour during this period at a range of scales. Capture scales ranged from 1:5 000 to 1:80 000.\nThe Historical Air Photo Enhancement program (HAPE) not only allows the capability to search, discover and use source imagery, but also provides the delivery and viewing of enhanced historic rectified imagery mosaics. This new development means the community at large can now access and utilise spatially accurate historic imagery:\n1.   Through the Historical Imagery Viewer\n2.   Directly in a wide range for GIS Mapping applications as a Web map Tile Service (WMTS).
