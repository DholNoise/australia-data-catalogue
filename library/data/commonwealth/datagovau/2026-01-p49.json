    "description": "AATAMS represents the higher biological monitoring of the marine environment for the IMOS program. Currently AATAMS uses acoustic technology, CTD satellite trackers and bio loggers to monitor coastal and oceanic movements of marine animals from the Australian mainland to the sub-Antarctic islands and as far south as the Antarctic continent. \n\nAcoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for observing tagged marine animals with networks or cross shelf arrays (curtains) of receivers, allowing animals to be monitored over scales of 100s of metres to 100s of kilometres. An array or network consists of a series of acoustic receivers that can be left on the sea floor for up to 7 years with the ability to upload data as often as needed. NCRIS and partner investments will target areas identified by regional nodes. Three regions will be targeted: the east coast of Australia, northwestern Western Australia and South Australia.\n\nVR2's deployed in conjunction with other moorings will provide information on long range movement of a variety of species including endangered and protected species (i.e. White Sharks and Grey Nurse Sharks), and valuable commercial species (i.e. Tuna)\n\nCurtains are mobile and can be deployed in different configurations for specific IMOS projects. The continued coordination of acoustic tag codes between researchers means that acoustic array around Australia will provide the combined infrastructure to monitor movement of highly migratory marine species between all jurisdictions.\n\nCTD satellite trackers and bio loggers currently deployed on a large range of animals are collecting a wide range of data. This includes behavioural and physical data such as the depth, temperature, salinity and movement effort of individual marine animals. \n\nAATAMS is set up to collect data over a long period of time. This sustained approach will enable researchers to assess the effects of climate change, ocean acidification and other physical changes that affect animals within the marine environment.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to estimate past sea-surface temperature in the Southeast Indian Ocean. The accumulation of diatom microplankton assemblages in sediments being the proxy for these records of climatic change. \n\nA transfer function is a mathematical method that allows quantitative estimations of environmental parameters from past biogenic sedimentation. In this study, a diatom transfer function was established to relate biological species to selected environmental parameter of the ocean (sea-surface temp). These equations were then employed on observed fossil species from core samples to provide quantitative estimates of sea-surface temperature.\n\nEstimates of sea-surface temperature are given here for core MD88-784. The information provided gives the extrapolated age-scale through the core, and two estimates of feb SST based on different diatom transfer functions (DTF 109/24/6 and DTF 166/34/4). \n\nIt is probable that the 'real' SST signal lies between the model estimates. The model diagnostics and lower number of non-analogue events from DTF 109/24/6 over that of results produced by DTF 166/34/4 suggest that SST estimates are closer to those provided by the former model.",

    "title": "Sulphate complexes of YREE as a key to understanding unconformity-related HREE deposits",
    "description": "Heavy rare earth elements are essential in renewable energy and high-tech products. Some natural rare earth element (REE) deposits exhibit heavy rare earth element (HREE) enrichment from &lt;&nbsp;10% to ~85% of the REE budget (Williams-Jones et al., 2015). \n\n\n\nControls on REE fractionation in hydrothermal systems are imposed by (1) changes in the relative stability of REE aqueous complexes with temperature (Migdisov et al., 2016) and (2) incorporation or rejection of REE by crystalline structures. Also, the REEs are invariably found as solid solutions but not as pure minerals. REE and yttrium (Y) sulphate complexes are some of the most stable REE and Y aqueous species in hydrothermal fluids (Migdisov and William-Jones, 2008, 2016; Guan et al., 2022) and may be responsible for REE transport and deposition in sediment-hosted deposits. Within the unconformity-related deposits, REEs are hosted mostly by xenotime ((Y,Dy,Er,Tb,Yb)PO4) and minor florencite ((La,Ce)Al3(PO4)2(OH)6) (Nazari-Dehkordi et al., 2019). Modelling the stability of xenotime in the H-O-Cl-(±F)-S-P aqueous system is critical for understanding HREE enrichment in this mineral system.\n\n\n\nWe use a newly derived thermodynamic dataset depos for REESO4+ and REE(SO4)2‑ aqueous complexes to generate stability diagrams illustrating mechanisms of REE transport and deposition in the above deposits. Sulphate REE complexes may dominate even in chloride-rich brines and facilitate REE mobilization in acid oxidizing environments. Previously Nazari-Dehkordi et al. (2019) proposed an ore genesis model involving the mixing of discrete hydrothermal fluids that separately carried REE + yttrium and phosphorus. The speciation model that includes sulphate complexes expands this scenario; a process resulting in fluid neutralization or reduction will also promote precipitation of xenotime enriched in HREEs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis Abstract was submitted/presented to the 2022 Specialist Group in Geochemistry, Mineralogy and Petrology (SGGMP) Conference 7-11 November (https://gsasggmp.wixsite.com/home/biennial-conference-2021)",

The data spans the months of 2003 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

The voyage’s first leg transited from Hobart to Nuku’alofa (10–19 Aug 2025), where science participants boarded. A mid-voyage transfer occurred on 05 Sep, and all science personnel disembarked in Nuku’alofa on 23 Sep before the final transit to Brisbane (23 Sep–1 Oct 2025).\n\nThe EM2040MK2 provides a 0.4 degree by 0.7 degree angular resolution. The echosounder's nominal frequency is 400 kHz (with a range of 200-700 kHz) and it operated in dual swath mode. \n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 71 files totalling 26 GB of raw data and 71 files totalling 203 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

Together, the DEOPE and the Commissioner promote an integrated approach to EEO that recognises the importance of equity and diversity in optimising service design and delivery to the broader community.\r\n\r\nTo assist the DEOPE to monitor the diversity of the workforce, each public authority is required to obtain relevant workforce demographic information from their employees. Local governments, universities, and other entities listed in Schedule 1 of the Public Sector Management Act 1994 (apart from the Western Australian Police Force and Electorate Offices) provide this demographic information through the EEO survey. The Western Australian Police Force and Electorate Offices report workforce data through the human resource minimum obligatory information requirement (HRMOIR) process. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, 138 local governments, four public universities, and 17 other Schedule 1 PSM Act authorities completed the EEO survey. Data was collected as at March 31 2015.\r\n\r\nThis data set contains a summary of demographics as reported through the EEO survey for each public authority. \r\n\r\nFurther information and aggregate data for each authority type is available in the Director of Equal Opportunity in Public Employment annual report 2015.\r\n",

    "title": "Effect of chemical abrasion of zircon on SHRIMP U-Pb, d180O, Trace element, and LAICPMS trace element and Lu Hf isotopic analyses",
    "description": "This study assesses the effect of chemical abrasion on in-situ mass spectrometric isotopic and elemental analyses in zircon. Chemical abrasion improves the U-Pb systematics of SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analyses of reference zircons, while leaving other isotopic systems largely unchanged. SIMS 206Pb/238U ages of chemically abraded reference materials TEMORA-2, 91500, QGNG, and OG1 are precise to within 0.25 to 0.4%, and are within uncertainty of chemically abraded TIMS reference ages, while SIMS 206Pb/238U ages of untreated zircons are within uncertainty of TIMS reference ages where chemical abrasion was not used. Chemically abraded and untreated zircons appear to cross-calibrate within uncertainty using all but one possible permutations of reference materials, provided that the corresponding chemically abraded or untreated reference age is used for the appropriate material. In the case of reference zircons QGNG and OG1, which are slightly discordant, the SIMS U-Pb ages of chemically abraded and untreated material differ beyond their respective 95% confidence intervals.\n\nSIMS U-Pb analysis of chemically abraded zircon with multiple growth stages are more difficult to interpret. Treated igneous rims on zircon crystals from the S-type Mount Painter Volcanics are much lower in common Pb than the rims on untreated zircon grains. However, the analyses of chemically abraded material show excess scatter. Chemical abrasion also changes the relative abundance of the ages of zircon cores inherited from the sedimentary protolith, presumably due to some populations being more likely to survive the chemical abrasion process than others. We consider these results from inherited S-type zircon cores to be indicative of results for detrital zircon grains from unmelted sediments.\n\nTrace element, &delta;18O, and εHf analyses were also performed on these zircons. None of these systems showed substantial changes as a result of chemical abrasion. The most discordant reference material, OG1, showed a loss of OH as a result of chemical abrasion, presumably due to dissolution of hydrous metamict domains, or thermal dehydration during the annealing step of chemical abrasion. In no case did zircon gain fluorine due to exchange of lattice-bound substituted OH or other anions with fluorine during the HF partial dissolution phase of the chemical abrasion process. As the OG1, QGNG, and TEMORA-2 zircon samples are known to be compositionally inhomogenous in trace element composition, spot-to-spot differences dominated the trace element results. Even the 91500 megacrystic zircon pieces exhibited substantial chip-to-chip variation. The LREE in chemically abraded OG1 and TEMORA-2 were lower than in the untreated samples. Ti concentration and phosphorus saturation ((Y+REE)/P) were generally unchanged in all samples.\n\n<b>Citation:</b> Kooymans, C., Magee Jr., C. W., Waltenberg, K., Evans, N.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of live-born babies at or after term with an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes for births at or after term. This has been calculated with the number of live-born babies at or after term (from 37 completed weeks gestational age) with an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes, divided by the number of live-born babies born at or after term (from 37 completed weeks gestational age), and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more. If the baby is alive the birth is a live birth. If the baby is not alive the birth is a stillbirth.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks. The term is defined as gestational age between 37 and 41 weeks.\n\n\nBirths included are live-born babies born at or after term.\n\n\nBirths excluded are stillbirths and babies born before term (before 37 weeks).\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "The record describes data collected from a winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored in the central part of Jervis Bay, New South Wales (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nTwo resources are provided in this record: 1) A schematic of depth bin location for the winter deployment and, 2) The raw, or unfiltered current values for each bin depth provided every 60 minutes in terms of east/west and north/south components.\n\nThis child record relates to the parent, c571bb80-2ae7-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.",

    "description": "The 2017 Land use captures how the landscape in NSW is being used for food production, forestry, nature conservation, infrastructure and urban development. It can be used to monitor changes in the landscape and identify impacts on biodiversity values and individual ecosystems.\n\nThe NSW 2017 Land use mapping is dated September 2017. \n\nThis is version 1.5 of the dataset, published December 2023.\n\nVersion 1.5 of the 2017 Land use incorporates the following updates:\n<ul>\n<li>Fine scale mapping of the Central Coast, Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions</li>\n<li>Mapping enhancements to regional centres to improve the mapping accuracy for these centres</li>\n<li>NSW road network based on road centreline data from Transport NSW, with standardised buffer applied to approximate the carriage width based on the road type</li>\n<li>Plantation type (native hardwood and softwood) information within State Forest Estates </li>\n<li>Horticulture data to tertiary or commodity level present in September 2017 from Australian Tree Crop Map Dashboard developed by University of New England - Applied Agricultural Remote Sensing Centre \nhttps://www.une.edu.au/research/research-centres-institutes/applied-agricultural-remote-sensing-centre/collaborative-r-and-d-opportunities/industry-applications-and-maps</li>\n<li>Fixes to identified errors since published version 1.2 </li>\n</ul>\n\nPrevious Versions\n*Version 1.4 internal update (not published)\n* Version 1.3 internal update (not published)\n* Version 1.2 published 24 June 2020 - Fine scale update to Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area\n* Version 1 published August 2019\n\nThe 2017 Land use is based on Aerial imagery and Satellite imagery available for NSW. These include, but not limited to; digital aerial imagery (ADS) captured by NSW Department of Customer Service (DCS), high resolution urban (Conurbation) digital aerial imagery captured on behalf of DCS, SPOT 5, 6 &amp; 7(Airbus), Planet™, Sentinel 2 (European Space Agency) and LANDSAT (NASA) Satellite Imagery. Mapping also includes commercially available imagery from Nearmap™ and Google Earth™, along with Google Street View™.   \n\nMapping takes into consideration ancillary datasets such as tenure such as National Parks and State forests, cadastre, roads parcels, land zoning, topographic information and Google Maps, in conjunction with visual interpretation and field validation of patterns and features on the ground. \n\nThe 2017 Land use was captured on screen using ARC GIS (Geographical Information Software) at a scale of 1:8,000 scale (or better) and features are mapped down to 2 hectares in size. Exceptions were made for targeted Land use classes such as horticulture, intensive animal husbandry and urban environments, which were mapped at a finer scale.\n\nThe 2017 Land use has complete coverage of NSW. It also includes updates to the fine scale Horticulture mapping for the east coast of NSW - Newcastle to the Queensland boarder and Murray-Riverina Region.  This horticultural mapping includes operations to the commodity level based on field work and high-resolution imagery interpretation. \n\nLand use classes assigned are based on activities that have occurred in the last 5-10 years that may be part of a rotational practice. Time-series LANDSAT information has been used in conjunction with more recent Satellite Imagery to determine whether grasslands have been disturbed or subject to ongoing land management activities over the past 30 years.\n\nThe 2017 Land use was captured on screen using ARC GIS (Geographical Information Software) at a scale of 1:8,000 scale (or better) and features are mapped down to 2 hectares in size. Exceptions were made for targeted Land use classes such as horticulture, intensive animal husbandry and urban environments (including Greater Sydney Metropolitan region), which were mapped at a finer scale. \n\nThe reliability scale of the dataset is 1:10,000.\n\nMapping has been subject to a peer review and quality assurance process.\n\nLand use information has been captured in accordance with standards set by the Australian Collaborative Land Use Mapping Program (ACLUMP) and using the Australian Land Use and Management ALUM Classification Version 8. The ALUM classification is based upon the modified Baxter &amp; Russell classification and presented according to the specifications contained in http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification.\n\nThis  product will be incorporated in the National Catchment scale land use product 2020 that will be available as a 50m raster - Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/data-download\n\nThe Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) will continue to complete land use mapping at approximately 5-year intervals. \n\nThe 2017 Land use product is considered as a benchmark product that can be used for Land use change reporting. Ongoing improvements to the 2017 Land use product will be undertaken to correct errors or additional improvements to the mapping.  ",

Area is not the principal basis for determining the predominant use. The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2024-25</em>.

    "description": "<b>Version 29 January 2020</b>\nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Significant Trees and North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.\n\n",

    "description": "Wine grape farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated wine grape farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on wine grape farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where most of the Basin's wine grapes are produced. Average farm cash incomes of wine grape farms rose from 2006-07 to 2011-12 before falling in 2012-13 in response to lower grape production. An increase in production contributed to slightly higher average farm cash incomes in 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n Grape crops in many areas of the Basin require regular irrigation because of the warm and relatively dry climate. From 2006-07 to 2014-15 the average volume of water used on wine grape farms mostly increased with this increase mainly due to an increase in average farm size. The proportion of grape farms using drip/trickle irrigation technologies has increased. \r\n\r\n The number of grape growers trading temporary water allocations varied from year to year. The years with the highest proportions of net buyers were 2007-08 and 2008-09. ",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

There are two exceptions in this dataset. In June 2011, Bass Coast Shire became part of District 8 when the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries indicated that it should be part of District 9.

The core was located on the Tasman Fracture Zone of the Mid-Ocean Ridge, within the Polar Front Zone.  \n\nSediment samples were taken at 10cm intervals. Isotopic analysis was performed on tests of the planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (200-250um), and revealed that the core covered two climatic cycles. The base of the core was found to represent the end of isotope-stage 7, as was suggested by the last abundant appearance datum (LAAD) of H. karstenii.\n\nThe core contained 195kyr of sedimentation within its 1030cm length. The results also indicate that the Holocene period has the highest rates of sedimentation observed through time. Further variations (excluding isotope-stage 1) appear to indicate that a reduction of the sedimentation rate occurred during the interglacial periods, in contrast to that of the glacials.",

    "title": "Haslams Creek Flood Study",
    "description": "THE STUDY AREA\nHaslams Creek drains a catchment area of about 17km2 in the Auburn Council Local\nGovernment Area. Figure 1 defines the catchment and the major drainage branches\nwhile all the modelled drainage branches are shown in greater detail in Figure 8.\nLand use within the catchment is mostly residential with pockets of industrial and\ncommercial land use while the south-eastern portion of the catchment also includes a\nportion of the Rockwood Cemetery.\nThe main creek is a concrete lined channel upstream of Parramatta Road but has an\nunlined invert and lined banks between Parramatta Road and the M4 Motorway. The\ncreek channel downstream of the M4 Motorway has recently been reconstructed as part\nof the Olympic Village development. This flood study is only concerned with the portion\nof the catchment upstream of the M4 Motorway.\nThe trunk drainage system for the catchment includes various stormwater channels and\npipe networks which discharge into Haslams Creek. The various tributary stormwater\nchannels are all lined. There are numerous structures along the length of the channels,\nmainly road and rail crossings, but there are also some instances of residential and\nindustrial developments spanning the channels.\nThe extent of trunk drainage system analysis was defined in the Study brief (see\nAppendix A) and is also summarised in Table 1. Some parts of the trunk drainage\nsystem, including Haslams Creek, are under the control of Sydney Water while other parts\nof the system are under the control of Auburn Council, as also summarised in Table 1.\nOverbank flooding of the open channel systems and surcharging of the pipe drainage\nsystems have occurred during large rainfall events, such as those occurring in November\n1961, August 1986 and January 1996. Areas of the catchment which have experienced\nproblems in the past include:\n\nVivian Crescent, which is drained by a small capacity pipe, and also experiences\noverland flow from the Railway Culverts Sub-Branch and from Campbell St;\nBachell Street, Delhi Street and between Simla Street and Parramatta Road on the\nArthur Street Branch;\nbetween James Street and East Street on the Joseph Street Branch;\nFrederick Street and Sweet Street (upstream of the Motor Registry) on the Church\nStreet Branch;\nbetween Dartbrook Road and Holliday Lane on the St Hilliers Road Branch; and\nbetween Harrow Road and Dudley Street on the Auburn Heights Branch.\n\nREASONS FOR STUDY\nWhile there has been occasions of overflow of the trunk drainage systems and associated \ninundation of adjoining lands the extent of such inundation may be substantially greater\nduring large storm events. Therefore Council required a study to define such flood\nbehaviour to use as a basis for floodplain management.\nVarious studies to derive design flood levels and discharges for certain parts of the\ncatchment have been undertaken but there were some inconsistencies in the results of\nthese studies. Council therefore commissioned a review of those studies. The resulting\n1996 Bewsher Consulting Review of Haslams Creek Flood Studies report (Reference 1)\nreviewed all of the previous flood studies for Haslams Creek and found that:\n\na large number of flood investigations had been completed within the study area.\nThose studies utilised various hydrologic and hydraulic models, various ground\nsurvey data, various modelling assumptions (e.g. extent of flood storage), various\nassumptions concerning modelling of hydraulic structures, various techniques for\nmodel calibration and verification, various assumptions concerning development\nconditions within the catchment, etc. The geographical coverage of each study was\nalso different in most cases;\ngiven the nature of the Haslams Creek catchment, the models adopted for a flood\nstudy or floodplain management study needed to be able to simulate:\n(1)channel storage and floodplain storage adjacent to the existing channel system,\nespecially upstream of the numerous railway and road crossings;\n(2) affluxes at road and railway structures;\n(3) a mixture of subcritical and supercritical flow, including hydraulic jumps;\n(4) secondary overland flowpaths;\n(5) pipe system capacities, pit losses and flow in pipes with submerged outlets;\nnone of the previous studies had adequately modelled all of these aspects. Most of\nthe previous studies had a limited geographical coverage. Also a number of small\nchanges have occurred in the catchment and the channel systems since the studies\nwere completed.\n\nConsequently, the study recommended that a new flood study be undertaken for the\nbranches upstream of the M4 Motorway.\nThe report included recommendations regarding hydrologic and hydraulic modelling. That\nis, a combination of RAFTS and ILSAX models were deemed suitable for the hydrologic\nmodelling of the open channels and piped systems respectively and a combination of\nMIKE-11 and/or HEC-RAS models were considered suitable for the hydraulic modelling\nof the open channels with hydraulic gradeline analyses of each pipe drainage system.\nThe methodology adopted for this report is consistent with those recommendations and\nis detailed in Section 4.\nIn accordance with Council's study brief (reference Appendix A) this report provides\nestimates of:\n\ndesign discharges for both the open channel and piped drainage systems for 5, 20\nand 100 year average recurrence interval (ARI) and probable maximum flood (PMF)\nevents;\ndesign flood levels, energy levels and velocities along the open channel system for\nthe 5, 20 ~nd 100 year ARI and PMF events;\nhydraulic and hazard categories for areas subject to overbank flooding; and\nthe capacity of the trunk pipe drainage system, the overland flow discharge and the \napproximate depth of overland flow.\n",

    "description": "Summary of species occurrence data from 1900 to 2020 for Australian marine species organised by IMCRA region and status as an introduced or invasive species using the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) list for Australia. Counts are provided by species and IMCRA region for:\n\nThe total number of occurrence records within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period\nThe number of distinct species recorded within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period  \n\nThe GRIIS list identifies species that are known or believed to have been introduced to Australia. Species that are not included in the GRIIS Australia list are treated here as native species. The GRIIS list also identifies a subset of introduced species as invasive species based on knowledge that these species have had a harmful impact. This dataset organises species occurrences using these GRIIS data to assign species to one of three categories:\n\nNative – not an introduced species\nIntroduced – an introduced species that is not considered invasive\nInvasive – an introduced species that is considered invasive  \n\nThe GRIIS lists have been compiled by experts with knowledge of introduced and invasive species in each country and are still being improved. It should particularly be noted that version 1.6 of the GRIIS Australia list includes a number of species which are native to Australia but which have been translocated to new parts of the country for conservation purposes. In future versions of the GRIIS Australia list, these species will be appropriately identified and can be excluded as required. This is important since the list does not indicate the areas in which the species is considered to have been introduced (including translocated). These species were manually excluded before the dataset was generated, but this version should be treated with caution. Future versions of this dataset will benefit from improvements to the GRIIS Australia list.  \nOccurrence records were aggregated and organised by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/) and include survey and monitoring data collected and managed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/).\nTo find out more about this dataset, visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/summary-data-introduced-species-occurrences-by-marine-ecoregion/\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.26197/ala.91179dd6-d56e-404f-97a7-ea6382307a17",

The surveys were conducted as part of a collaboration between the IMOS AUV Facility, the National Environment Research Program (NERP) Theme 1 - National monitoring, evaluation and reporting and NSW DPI Fisheries.  Dives focused on a number of reefs in 20 m to 60 m of water depth and consisted of both dense 25 m x 25 m full photo quadrants designed to allow repeat surveys over years and broader surveys up to 2km in length to document habitat distributions over broader scales.  Additional scientific operations carried out at these sites include multibeam bathymetry, towed video and Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS).",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Brisbane City) with SA2 code (31105).\nBuildings is a spatial dataset which represents Australia's built environment derived from remotely sensed imagery and aggregated data sources. The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Brisbane City SA2 by AURIN.",

Area is not the principal basis for determining the predominant use. The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2019-20</em>.

    "title": "Final report: National Marine Sediments Database and Seafloor Characteristics  Project",
    "description": "The National Marine Sediments Database and Seafloor Characteristics project is a collaborative effort between the National Oceans Office and Geoscience Australia. The aims of the project included identification and collation of existing marine sediment data within the Australian Marine Jurisdiction, development and population of the MARS sediments database and mapping and analysis of sediment data for the Northern Planning Area and the Australian region to provide information for the National Benthic Marine Bioregionalisation. \nThe creation of the MARS database marks the transition to a new era of easy internet access to quantitative seafloor information. This is the first project to critically assess the quality and coverage of Australia's seafloor sediment data on a national scale. The initial phase of the project was the identification and collation of sediment data. At the completion of this phase, the MARS database contained about 25,000 samples for which 138,000 properties had been recorded. \nMaps of sediment properties were produced using validated quantitative data for two regions: the Northern Planning Area (NPA) and the whole of the Australian Marine Jurisdiction, excluding external territories. These maps show the distribution of measured grain size data (weight percent gravel, sand and mud), calculated mean grain size, as well as sediment classification based on the Folk scheme (Folk, 1954), and carbonate content. Mean grain size data for six of the marine domains were used to model sediment mobility in waters less than 300 m depth, using Geoscience Australia's GEOMAT package. The results of the modelling were produced as maps of tide and wave exceedance, and an energy regime regionalisation. \nAs a direct result of this project, the MARS database is now an important scientific and educational resource for those requiring detailed information on seafloor sediment characteristics within the Australian Marine Domain areas. The maps generated by this project show the level of detail and type of presentation possible when using quantitative data, but significant gaps in measured data coverage were also identified. Some 70% of the total marine domain remains unmapped in terms of measured sediment data. Much of this area is off the continental shelf, although gaps in the data coverage on the shelf are significant, particularly in the South-west and West-central Marine Domains\nStrategic directions for improving the data coverage include the analysis of existing sediment samples from Australian and overseas repositories. A valuable resource of seabed samples stored in Australia and overseas has been identified. These samples, if analysed, have the potential to double the existing overall measured data coverage for Australia's Marine Domains and would provide a cost-effective way of generating new data. The South-west Marine Domain would provide a useful pilot study to test the utility of analysing existing material.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2009 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Land capability for annual horticulture in the south west of Western Australia based on analysis and interpretation of the best available soil-landscape mapping dataset (DPIRD-027).\n\nLand capability refers to the ability of land to support a type of land use without causing damage. See DAFWA Resource Management Technical Report 298 for a description of the qualities assessed and the methodology involved.\n\nThe assessment for annual horticulture covers the production of irrigated horticultural crops from plants with short-term life cycles (typically completed within the period of a year). Crops include annual fruits (strawberries, melons, etc.), vegetables (e.g. potatoes, lettuce, cabbages, tomatoes, pumpkins, etc.), commercial turf production and cut flowers. \n\nThe assumptions for the land use as assessed include: \n• crops are grown for commercial production \n• crops are shallow-rooted with most roots using only the top 50 cm of soil \n• crops are irrigated using sprinkler or trickle systems \n• mechanised cultivation occurs at least annually \n• fertilisers and herbicides, fungicides and/or pesticides are broadcast at least annually \n• crop rotation is practised \n• considers physical requirements only and ignores socio-economic factors. \n\nCapability ratings do not take into account factors such as the availability and quality of water supplies for irrigation or climatic risks such as frost or heat stress. Such factors need to be considered as a separate layer of information.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for Plant Health Australia  \r\n Overview  \r\n Experience from overseas indicates that the cost of an incursion by black-striped mussel is likely to be large without management. This report presents a comparison of the estimated costs associated with the alternative responses to an incursion: eradication and containment. Hypothetical incursions of black-striped mussel in ten case study areas across four Australian ports were considered. The cost of eradicating the initial mussel incursion from a case study area is compared to the cost of containing the mussel population to the port encompassing the case study area. The findings indicate that eradication is in most cases the preferred and less costly option over a range of time scales with the caveat that the likelihood of successful eradication will depend on early detection and response. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n•  Mytilopsis sallei  (black-striped mussel) is an invasive marine species that has been translocated from its native range in the Caribbean to a large number of ports in southern and eastern Asia. \r\n• An incursion of black-striped mussel in Darwin in 1999 was successfully eradicated at a cost of in excess of $3.2 million in 2012 terms. This species has been reported to have become established in a number of overseas trading ports, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai. The risks of translocation to Australia have therefore increased in recent years. \r\n• If an incursion by this species is not managed, it has the potential to cause significant and widespread economic and environmental damage. \r\n• A comparison of the costs associated with eradication with those of containment and control in a range of scenarios found that in many cases eradication is the preferred option, but containment and control may be preferred in some situations. \r\n",

    "description": "CSIRO Protected Area Representativeness Index (PARC: Representativeness) is a global 30 arc-second product for 1970,1980,1990,2000,2005,2010,2015, 2020, and 2024. The Protected Area Representativeness and Connectedness (PARC) indices measure the extent to which terrestrial protected areas, and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), are ecologically representative, and well-connected (both to one another, and to other areas of intact natural ecosystems in the surrounding landscape). For the purposes of reporting against the 2010-2020 Aichi Targets, the PARC was originally configured as two separate indicators: the Protected Area Representativeness Index (or ‘PARC-representativeness’) and the Protected Area Connectedness Index (or ‘PARC-connectedness’). However, these two indices were always designed in a manner which would allow them to be logically combined to yield a composite indicator of the extent to which a system of protected areas and OECMs is both ecologically representative and well-connected.  \n\nThe PARC indices, whether generated separately or as a composite, are used to monitor and report past-to-present trends in representativeness and connectedness by repeated calculation using best-available mapping of protected areas and OECMs at multiple points in time, e.g. for different years. They can also provide a foundation for assessing the contribution that potential additions to the system of protected areas and OECMs might make to improving present PARC scores, thereby providing a foundation for prioritising such actions.      \n\nThe PARC indices time series from 1970-2020 can be viewed on the UN Biodiversity Lab web map via the link in the Related Links section below.

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 11 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a subset of the Sedimentary Basins dataset developed by Geoscience Australia. It represents those sedimentary basins in the South-west commonwealth marine planning region that are considered to be prospective for petroleum, and it has been attributed with a rating describing the relative prospectivity of different areas. This interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity is derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins. The classification terms used represent a simplified qualitative assessment of petroleum prospectivity, and are subject to future change as new data are gathered and interpreted.\n\nThe information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the South-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe Sedimentary Basins dataset itself provides outlines for the maximum extent of Australian geological provinces and their components, including sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic provinces, both onshore and offshore.  These data were compiled as part of Geoscience Australia's integrated digital information system to provide improved accessibility and knowledge relating to the petroleum and minerals geology and prospectivity, and to provide a national stratigraphic and tectonic framework for Australia.  The current Sedimentary Basins dataset is not complete for Australia, and covers only offshore sedimentary provinces and a selection of sedimentary and igneous provinces in onshore eastern Australia.The information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the South-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe following caveat applies to the use of the data in any mapping products:\n'The interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity are derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins. The classification terms used represent a simplified qualitative assessment of petroleum prospectivity, and are subject to future change as new data are gathered and interpreted.'\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Program from sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. A landscape classification approach was used to determine how hydrological changes due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development may affect ecosystems at a landscape scale in the Isa GBA region. Nine landscape classes have been identified for the Isa GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nInputs into the landscape classification were based on existing classification schemes wherever possible and can be purely physical, biological or predictive. Choice of approach depends on the availability of data at an appropriate scale, as well as the expertise and resources for undertaking the assessment. Landscape classifications should be credible, transparent, logical and consistently applied; where possible, match other classifications (or at least some of their classes); and be feasible within available resourcing. The landscape classification developed for the Isa GBA region is based on Queensland Land Zones (Wilson and Taylor, 2012), which were supplied by the Queensland Government (State of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science), 2018) and assigned to corresponding landscape classes.\r\n\r\nState of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science) (2018) Biodiversity status pre-clear reg ecosys QLD 2018/03/01.

    "title": "Victorian Alpine Resorts - Daily Snow Depth Records Mount Baw Baw",
    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

A short sea trial voyage (October 22 - 25, Hobart - Hobart) was undertaken prior to the charter. Data for those days is also included in this data set.\nThe Kongsberg EM122 multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry,  backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter.\nThe EM122 provides a 1 degree by 1 degree angular resolution. The echosounder's nominal frequency is 12 kHz.\nData are stored in .all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .wcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 1658 files totalling 58.5 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nTide corrections were not applied to the processed data. Processed data had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes:\n    Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries\nas well as on a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web page to access these reports and for further information: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the forestry node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment; the only commodity in this node is Radiata pine. Maps are provided for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination contained in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations.",

    "description": "A tide gauge mooring was installed in 10-12m of water 200m off the west coast of Bowen Island, Jervis Bay. Opposed to other moorings in the area, this particular mooring did not house additional current meters. \n\nOver a period of approx. 9 months the mooring was deployed 4 times in the same location (as illustrated). \nDeployments 1-4  -35.1183 S 150.763 E. \nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 22/6/89 - 13/7/89... 2) 28/8/89 - 13/11/89... 3) 13/11/89 - 29/1/90... 4) 29/1/90 - 28/3/90.\n\nDatasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the tide gauge over the study period.\nThe Aanderaa WLR5 tide gauges used in this study average over 41 seconds for all sampling intervals. In the case of the 2nd and 3rd deployment the sampling interval was 15mins, while for the 4th deployment a sampling interval of 30mins was used. Unfortunately no data is available from the 1st deployment. \n\nThe tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~10m in all deployments. In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

The data spans the months of 2011 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "The Coffs Harbour (COF) HF ocean radar site is located near the point at which the East Australian Current (EAC) begins to separate from the coast.  Here the EAC is at its narrowest and swiftest: to the north it is forming from the westwards subtropical jet, and to the south it forms eddies and eventually the warm water moves eastwards across the Tasman Sea, forming a front with the cold water of the Southern Ocean.  \n\nThe connection between coastal and continental shelf waters is fundamental to the understanding of the anthropogenic impact on the coastal ocean and the role of the ocean in mitigating urban marine water quality. The oceans off Eastern Australia and in particular in the region of New South Wales have a complex circulation structure, and are strongly connected with other regional seas and currents. \n\nThe East Australia Current (EAC) flows from tropical regions southward along the NSW continental slope, bringing tropical biota southward. These current structures provide strong physical and biological connectivity, allowing substantial transport and dispersion of biota between regions, and influencing the transport and upwelling of nutrients, which are fundamental to biological productivity.  \n\nThe COF HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Red Rock (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) to the north of Coffs Harbour and North Nambucca (-24.111 S, 152.713 E) to the south.  The area of focus is off Coffs Harbour where IMOS and the NSW government have mooring sites.  These radars operate at a frequency of 13.920 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz and a maximum range of 100 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC14) was collected from a depth of 2004 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~80cm into the core. Two samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; from the sediment surface (GC14-0) representing interglacial sediment, while the second sample, from 80cm (GC14-80) represents glacial sediment. XRD analysis of these samples show a slight increase in carbonate percentage during the interglacial compared to the glacial, with increased clay and quartz during the glacial. During the interglacial there are minor amounts of Mg calcite, which suggests that there is little influence from the reef platform on the sediments during the present sea-level, or that the core is presently below the Mg calcite compensation depth.",

    "title": "River Risk Ratings",
    "description": "The River Risk Ratings provide a comprehensive view of how river condition and risk have been assessed across New South Wales over the past three decades. This collection brings together historic and contemporary datasets developed from the 1990s to the present, illustrating the evolution of assessment methodologies used to understand river health, hydrological stress, and ecological vulnerability. Together, these datasets link spatial layers, tabular data, and supporting reports — forming a single point of truth for understanding how NSW river systems have been evaluated through time. \n\nThe River Risk Ratings are comprised of three key components, each reflecting a distinct period and methodology in river risk assessment: \n\n<strong>1. River Risk Ratings – Historic Stress Rivers Assessment (1990s)</strong>\n\nA historic dataset derived from the original Stress Rivers Approach (SRA) developed during the 1990s, prior to the introduction of the Water Management Act 2000. This early method classified rivers according to stress indicators such as water extraction pressure and ecological condition. It represents one of the first systematic attempts to quantify river stress across NSW and serves as an important baseline for later risk assessments. \n\n<strong>2. River Risk Ratings – Historic Macro Risk Assessment (2000s)</strong>  <em>yet to publish</em> \n\nA historic risk dataset developed during the 2000s by water planners. This macro-level assessment expanded on the earlier SRA work by incorporating hydrological and ecological metrics to evaluate risk at the catchment scale. It informed early water-sharing and planning frameworks under the emerging Water Management Act 2000 and provides continuity between the early and modern risk assessment models. \n\n<strong>3. River Risk Ratings – Contemporary Risk Assessment (2016–Present)</strong> <em>yet to publish</em> \n\nThe current and ongoing statewide river risk dataset developed from 2016 to the present. It consolidates a decade of river risk ratings into a centralised database, supported by spatial layers and associated reports (including those linked to the MDBA Water Resource Plans). This represents the most up-to-date and standardised approach to river risk assessment in NSW and forms the operational basis for future updates. \n\n\n\n<strong>How to Access the Data on the SEED Open Data Portal</strong>\nThis landing page provides an overview only. To view or download the data, perform the following:\n<ol>\n<li>Scroll down and click “Related Datasets” (Dataset relationship).</li>\n<li>Select one of the listed datasets.</li>\n<li>On that dataset’s page, the data will either be available in the <strong>Dataset Packages</strong> section (if files are attached) or in the <strong>External Links</strong> section (if the dataset redirects you to another site to view or download the data).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

    "description": "This classification of aquatic ecosystems was developed for the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office, Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Australia, and Murray-Darling Basin Authority to support the management of environmental water in the Murray-Darling basin.\nAn interim application of the Australian National Aquatic Ecosystem (ANAE) classification framework has been applied to all floodplain polygons. The associated data table contains the ANAE floodplain attributes and resulting typology. \n\nThis dataset is a merged product of three sources: Floodplain_MDBAv2_ANAE, Floodplain_SA_ANAE and Floodplain_RERP_ANAE.\n\nRERP_ANAE results from the merger of three separate 2009-2010 NSW Rivers Environmental Restoration Program (RERP) mapping layers for the Lowbidgee, Macquarie Marshes, and Gwydir wetlands. ANAE floodplain attributes and typology are assigned in the data table.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nLicenced for use under Creative Commons Australia Attribution. We request attribution as (c) Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Energy.\nVictoria\nVictoria maintains an inventory of wetlands (WETLAND_CURRENT) which is designed for use in Victorian wetland projects and is subject to ongoing validation and updates. WETLAND_CURRENT can be obtained from the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (see http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/forestry-and-land-use/maps-imagery-and-data\nfor further details). For lacustrine and palustrine aquatic ecosystems, the MDB_ANAE geodatabase is more suited to wetland projects involving other jurisdictions. While much of the data for lacustrine and palustrine wetlands was sourced from WETLAND_CURRENT, there may be some inconsistencies between MDB_ANAE geodatabase and WETLAND_CURRENT. The two datasets can be linked through the AltSrcID (MDB_ANAE geodatabase) and Wetland_No (WETLAND_CURRENT data set) fields.\nSA\nDue to the Basin-wide nature of this dataset, accuracy of final classes has not been ground truthed comprehensively, which could impact results of any analysis using this data. Therefore it is imperative that this dataset is assessed as to fitness for use in any application and decisions made about further levels of validation required. Significant care should be taken if information derived from this dataset is to guide decision making, form binding agreements regarding target setting, compliance of any form, or monitoring of achievements, this includes for the purpose of summarising areas of wetland types.
