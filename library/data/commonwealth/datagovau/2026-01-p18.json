    "title": "Burrow tenure in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis",
    "description": "Crabs sometimes vacate their territories due to continued harassment by their neighbours. To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. 20 Focal males were selected: 10 with male nearest neighbours and 10 with female nearest neighbours. The following day, at the same time relative to low tide, we determined whether the crabs were in the same burrows. Data recorded included: the tidal height and time, and whether each crab was present or not. A new set of 20 pairs were marked each day over a period of 26 days. \n\nThe data suggests the crabs were less likely to change burrows during neap tides. Males with female neighbours also tended to be more stable than males with male neighbours.",

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual retained catch (meaning the catch that is not returned to the sea) in kilograms, by species and fishery, for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea, where generally the weights are estimates only. Fish discarded at sea are not included in this dataset. Location of catches within a fishery is not included.\r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Fishers usually cannot accurately weigh fish at sea, so the estimated weights are mostly based on volume (i.e. the size and number of boxes of fish caught). Catch data are used in combination with gear, effort, and spatial data to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may filter out catches from their assessments because of data quality issues or group species differently. In addition, the data may be different in other datasets with different summations such as catch by season or catch from the date fish were landed at port.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect catches each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as: total allowable catch, closures of fishing areas, reducing boat numbers, or banning the catch of a particular species. Similarly, changes in market demand can affect which species are targeted. \r\nWhen the fish are landed at port, the accurate weight of fish is recorded in AFMA catch disposal records by both the fisher and fish receiver permit holder. This information can be found in the “Reported landed annual catch from Commonwealth fisheries catch disposal records” and its metadata, which is published on data.gov.au. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in the species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness, and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "(Abstract from 'The ducks of Macquarie Island')\n\nEarly reference to waterfowl on Macquarie Island and observations made by ANARE expeditioners between 1949 and 1985 are reviewed and discussed.  Apart from a unique (perhaps erroneous) record of a mute swan Cygnus olor, information is restricted to the Pacific black duck Anas superciliosa, the grey teal A. gibberifrons and the alien mallard A. platyrhynchos and its hybrids.\n\nBlack duck and grey teal were seen by early visitors to the Island, but despite the infrequent potential for escapes of domestic ducks, mallards were not recorded until 1949.  Occasional teal and mallards were seen in the years following the establishment of the permanent scientific station (1948) but mallards (and hybrids) have become more numerous in recent years.  Though grey teal may disperse to Macquarie Island in times of drought on the Australian mainland, the source of mallards may be New Zealand or the less distant Campbell and Auckland Islands.\n\nThe few available records of breeding (eggs, ducklings and nests) for black duck suggest that laying begins in September and extends at least into January.  Zooplankton is most abundant in spring and summer, but ducks may obtain high protein foods from the littoral and sublittoral areas and may also take seeds of terrestrial plants.\n\nAvailable information does not allow separation of habitats used by black duck or mallards.  However, most observations are around coastal areas.  There is some indication that records have increased along the south-western and eastern sides of the Island, but generally there are few observations of either species on the higher, central plateau.\n\nThe intrusion of mallards onto the Island and the resultant hybridisation with black duck poses a threat for the future integrity of the latter native species.\n\nThis dataset contains a review of the data available for Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and grey teal (Anas gibberifrons) and hybrids on Macquarie Island, collected from mid-1949 to January 1985. There is a period of relatively continuous and extensive data between February 1963 and January 1985. Discussion and references about habitat, breeding, feeding and hybrids is provided in the dataset (see the reference), as well as distribution maps.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nYear\n\nMonth\n\nPresence/Absence",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1990 to February 1991. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "<strong>Important notes for interpretation</strong>\n\n<strong>Factors influencing exposure</strong>: High mosquito numbers do not always lead to an increase in human arbovirus cases. Other factors, such as weather, human behaviour, and the use of protective measures, can affect the risk of exposure to mosquito-borne viruses.\n\n<strong>Trapping locations</strong>: Locations on maps reflect the mid-point of sites within a broader location, not exact mosquito trap sites (as some trapping sites are located on private properties).\n\n<strong>Seasonal variation</strong>: Some locations may consistently experience higher mosquito numbers throughout a season while others may have lower numbers and others may have sudden increases in mosquito numbers at points during the season. There may also be variability in mosquito numbers between seasons.\n\n<strong>Positive test results</strong>: For mosquito traps, a detection represents the presence of virus in at least one mosquito in a sample of trapped mosquitoes. For sentinel chickens, a positive test result means that one or more chickens in a flock have tested positive for antibodies directed against a particular virus for the first time, suggesting a newly acquired infection. Infection in chickens gives an indication that there is enough virus to transmit to humans.",

    "description": "###Introduction\r\nTraining.gov.au (TGA) is the National Register of Vocational Education and Training in Australia and contains authoritative information about Registered Training Organisations (RTOs), Nationally Recognised Training (NRT) and the approved scope of each RTO to deliver NRT as required in national and jurisdictional legislation.\r\n\r\n###TGA web-services overview\r\nTGA has a web service available to allow external systems to access and utilise information stored in TGA through an external system. The TGA web service is exposed through a single interface and web service users are assigned a data reader role which will apply to all data stored in the TGA.\r\n\r\nThe web service can be broadly split into three categories:\r\n\r\n1.   RTOs and other organisation types;\r\n\r\n2.   Training components including Accredited courses, Accredited course  Modules Training Packages, Qualifications, Skill Sets and Units of Competency;\r\n\r\n3.   System metadata including static data and statistical classifications.\r\n\r\nUsers will gain access to the TGA web service by first passing a user name and password through to the web server.  The web server will then authenticate the user against the TGA security provider before passing the request to the application that supplies the web services.\r\n\r\nThere are **two web services environments:**\r\n\r\n**1.   Production - ws.training.gov.au** – National Register production web services\r\n\r\n**2.   Sandbox  - ws.sandbox.training.gov.au** – National Register sandbox web services.  \r\n\r\nThe National Register sandbox web service is used to test against the current version of the web services where the functionality will be identical to the current production release.  The web service definition and schema of the National Register sandbox database will also be identical to that of production release at any given point in time.  The National Register sandbox database will be cleared down at regular intervals and realigned with the National Register production environment.\r\n\r\nEach environment has three configured services:\r\n\r\n1.

    "description": "The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2014 provides both spatial and text information about government, Indigenous and privately protected areas for continental Australia. State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current to 30 June 2014. The terrestrial component of the database has been previously released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 2010 and 2012.\n\nThis version, provides both spatial and text information about off-shore protected areas in both state and Commonwealth waters.  State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current for 30 June 2014. This is the seventh version of the CAPAD- Marine database, with previous versions published in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008 2010 and 2012. \n\nCAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area:\n\n\"A protected area is an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means\" (IUCN 1994).\n\nThe Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy (DOE) publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad\n\n This version of CAPAD 2014-Marine is a public / downloadable dataset available for use through the CC-BY licencing model. \n\nCommercial users: Commercial users should note the availability of a more descriptive dataset for Commonwealth Marine Reserves. It is recommended for use in commercial applications as it includes additional information about management arrangements for Commonwealth Marine Reserves. This dataset is available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license from:\nhttp://intspat01.ris.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B2E8DD19C-1B93-4D90-BD1C-128DDC4A2998%7D\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR MARINE USERS – TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\nThe process for developing management plans has been completed for the five Commonwealth marine reserve networks declared around Australia and the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve. Until the new management plans come into effect transitional management arrangements are in place. Under these transitional arrangements, there are no changes \"on the water\" for users in the new areas added to the Commonwealth marine reserve estate. If people hold an existing approval to undertake activities within Commonwealth marine reserves or the now-revoked Coral Sea Conservation Zone, they are able to continue to operate under the terms of the existing approval. No additional administrative requirements apply.\n\nThe management plan for the South-east Network came into effect on 1 July 2013 with the management plans for the South-west, North-west, North and Temperate East Networks and the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve are under review.

    "description": "<b>Version 29 January 2020</b>\nThe Rural Residential Lot Sizes Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "The 3 second (~90m) Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) version 1.0 was derived from resampling the 1 arc second (~30m) gridded DEM (ANZCW0703013355). The DEM represents ground surface topography, and excludes vegetation features. The dataset was derived from the 1 second Digital Surface Model (DSM, ANZCW0703013336) by automatically removing vegetation offsets identified using several vegetation maps and directly from the DSM. The 1 second product provides substantial improvements in the quality and consistency of the data relative to the original SRTM data, but is not free from artefacts. Man-made structures such as urban areas and power line towers have not been treated. The removal of vegetation effects has produced satisfactory results over most of the continent and areas with defects are identified in the quality assessment layers distributed with the data and described in the User Guide (Geoscience Australia and CSIRO Land and Water, 2010). A full description of the methods is in progress (Read et al., in prep, Gallant et al., in prep). The 3 second DEM was produced for use by government and the public under Creative Commons attribution.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied. \n\n\n\nThe Dynamic Land Cover Dataset of Australia is the first nationally consistent and thematically comprehensive land cover reference for Australia.  It is the result of a collaboration between Geoscience Australia and the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences, and provides a base-line for identifying and reporting on change and trends in vegetation cover and extent. Land cover is the observed biophysical cover on the Earth&#xBF;s surface, including native vegetation, soils, exposed rocks and water bodies as well as anthropogenic elements such as plantations, crops and built environments.  Remote sensing data recorded over a period of time allows the observation of land cover dynamics.  Different land cover types display distinct responses due to seasonal, climatic and anthropogenic drivers.  Classifying these responses provides a robust and repeatable way of characterising land cover types.  A key aspect of land cover is vegetation greenness. The greenness of vegetation is directly related to the amount of photosynthesis occurring, and can be measured as an index such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The Dynamic Land Cover Dataset presents land cover information for every 250m by 250m area of the country from April 2000 to April 2008. The classification scheme used to describe land cover categories in the Dynamic Land Cover Dataset conforms to the 2007 International Standards Organisation (ISO) land cover standard (19144-2).  The Dynamic Land Cover Dataset shows Australian land covers clustered into 34 ISO classes. These reflect the structural character of vegetation, ranging from cultivated and managed land covers (crops and pastures) to natural land covers such as closed forest and sparse, open grasslands.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe source data for the Dynamic Land Cover Dataset is a time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites operated by NASA. The time series includes 186 snapshots of vegetation greenness for each 250m by 250m area across the continent over an 8 year period from 2000 to 2008. Complete information on the creation of this product can be found in the following documents available from the Geoscience Australia website www.ga.gov.au/landcover.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2010) Dynamic Land Cover Dataset.

    "description": "Length and weight measurements for individual fish collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nAbundance and diversity of riverine fish populations are monitored annually at fixed sites within six Selected Areas using a standardised sampling regime involving boat or backpack electrofishing and fine mesh fyke nets (referred to as Category 1 sampling). These methods target large-bodied and small-bodied fish species respectively. A sample of measured individuals (length and weight) were collected for otolith sectioning and age determination to construct age vs size relationships.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Fish length weight.

    "description": "All the available data sets containing diatom counts were compiled. These data sets were the 166 database used by Pichon et al. (1992), new data gathered separately by Dr Pichon (1994) and the author (L. Armand-1997), and Abbott's (1973) southeast Indian Ocean surface sample data set. \n\nSince each of the data sets were developed over periods of years or were subject to differences in processing and taxonomy, primary analysis was concerned with aligning current taxonomic advances and knowledge against the record of species identified in each data. With exception only to the Abbott southeast Indian Ocean data set (which could no longer be located for verification), the remaining data sets were combined and subjected to taxonomic reform. \n\nFollowing taxonomic reform a core-top diatom database was compiled using sample-selection criteria and through the removal of samples representing unique environmental regimes (i.e. Antarctic Peninsula region). A total of 115 samples from an original 194 remained available for use, and is identified as the Antarctic Diatom Database (ADB).",

However, it is not intended to predict riverine flooding for specific land parcels. The map was created through an analysis of drainage patterns using data such as 10-meter contours from the best available elevation models, historical flood records, vegetation and soils mapping, and satellite imagery, rather than a specific flood modelling approach. This data serves as an interim assessment to help Local Government Authorities identify areas that may need further refinement.",

    "description": "Three Land Management Zones (LMZs) have been defined within Parks and Wildlife managed land at specified distances from the edge of the populated area. (see Reported Populated Areas data). The depth of these zones is defined by fire behaviour characteristics relevant to the zone purpose. The 200,000 ha prescribed burning target is allocated between the three zones in proportion to the amount of Parks and Wildlife managed land (including UCL) within each zone. Land Management Zone-A • LMZ-A is nearest to populated areas, including Parks and Wildlife managed lands within populated areas. • The objective of management in this zone is to reduce the likelihood of ember attack on populated areas in the event of a bushfire, by maintaining fuel in a condition that will not give rise to extreme fire behaviour. • The depth of LMZ-A is the spotting distance of the average fuels in LMZ-B; meaning that spot fires generated by a fire in LMZ-B will not reach the populated fringe. Land Management Zone-B • The next concentric buffer from the populated interface is LMZ-B. • The objective of management in this zone is to maintain an area within which a high intensity fire run could be arrested before it reaches LMZ-B. • The depth of LMZ-B is equal to the distance travelled by an ‘average’ bushfire in four hours, a period of time considered equivalent to the hottest period of an average day during the fire season. Land Management Zone-C • The third concentric buffer from the populated interface is LMZ-C, comprising the remainder of Parks and Wildlife managed land in the SWBRZ. • The objective of management in this area is to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of large, intense fires in the landscape.",

The accumulation of diatom microplankton assemblages in sediments being the proxy for these records of climatic change. \n\nA transfer function is a mathematical method that allows quantitative estimations of environmental parameters from past biogenic sedimentation. In this study, a diatom transfer function was established to relate biological species to selected environmental parameter of the ocean (sea-surface temp). These equations were then employed on observed fossil species from core samples to provide quantitative estimates of sea-surface temperature.\n\nEstimates of sea-surface temperature (SST) are given here based on the assemblages of diatoms found in core MD88-787. The information provided gives the extrapolated age-scale through the core, and an estimate of August SST based on a diatom transfer function - DTF 109/24/6.",

Data have been collected since November 1985 until January 1996. The transect is repeated approximately monthly. Profiles are obtained approximately every 60km (a 1 degree latitude / 1.5 degree longitude grid). \n\nThe data are obtained from XBTs (expendable bathythermographs) deployed via the Ship-of-Opportunity Program (SOOP) of the IOC/WMO Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS), and are now managed by the Joint Australian Facility for Ocean Observing Systems (JAFOOS), a collaborative venture between CSIRO Marine Research and the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC).\n\nExpendable Bathythermographs (XBTs) have been used for many years by oceanographers to measure the temperature of the upper ocean. These instruments are simple devices which are designed to be deployed from moving vessels, enabling broad scale coverage of the world's oceans.",

Because of the Leeuwin Current, water temperatures off Western Australia are some 4°C warmer than those at corresponding latitudes off the west coasts of southern Africa and South America. Water temperature measurements along the Western Australian coast are relatively sparse, although some intensive studies have been undertaken near cities and regional centres, as well as at selected sites important for fisheries. \n\nMonthly temperature statistics have been compiled for a number of sites along the west coast of Australia, using a variety of data sources.

Landfills can cause contamination, but once a landfill is closed, operators are obliged to rehabilitate and manage their sites. Even when closed, careful management of sites is required. Many rehabilitated landfills are now safe parks and public spaces, enjoyed by the community.\nThe register draws information from various sources and all sites listed undergo verification before inclusion on the register.\nWhile this public register will make landfill information more available, it should not be used as the only source of information when making important decisions. EPA will continue to build on the register, adding information and improving the service.\nThis dataset mirrors the VLR data available on EPA's website, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date information on operating landfill please visit the EPA register of permission.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2007.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Public authorities are obligated to monitor and promote equity and diversity outcomes to ensure an inclusive workplace culture and equal employment opportunity (EEO).  Activities associated with the achievement of these outcomes are reported in the annual report of the Director of Equal Opportunity in Public Employment (DEOPE). \r\n\r\nThe DEOPE, appointed by the Governor to fulfil a statutory role that is separate to that of the Public Sector Commissioner, is also an employee of the Public Sector Commissioner. Together, the DEOPE and the Commissioner promote an integrated approach to EEO that recognises the importance of equity and diversity in optimising service design and delivery to the broader community.\r\n\r\nTo assist the DEOPE to monitor the diversity of the workforce, each public authority is required to obtain relevant workforce demographic information from their employees. Local governments, universities, and other entities listed in Schedule 1 of the Public Sector Management Act 1994 (apart from the Western Australian Police Force and Electorate Offices) provide this demographic information through the EEO survey. The Western Australian Police Force and Electorate Offices report workforce data through the human resource minimum obligatory information requirement (HRMOIR) process. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, 138 local governments, four public universities, and 22 other Schedule 1 PSM Act authorities completed the EEO survey. Data for local governments was collected as at March 31 2014, and other authorities as at 30 June 2014.\r\n\r\nThis data set contains a summary of demographics as reported through the EEO survey for each public authority. \r\n\r\nFurther information and aggregate data for each authority type is available in the Director of Equal Opportunity in Public Employment annual report 2014.\r\n",

    "title": "Bauxite of Manus Island, Territory of Papua and New Guinea",
    "description": "Bauxite was found on Manus Island in 1952 by J.E. Thompson, Senior Resident Geologist, Territory of Papua and New Guinea, at three separate localities. At Lepatuan a dacite flow overlies bedded tuffs and both have been bauxitized. The former parent rock yields a porous granular bauxite containing about 1 percent silica, 55 percent alumina, 10-13 percent ferric oxide and 1 percent titania. Bauxite developed on the tuffs is nodular in character, and consists of gibbsite nodules embedded in soft clay-like bauxite. The composition of one sample of this bauxite is 11.7 percent silica, 51.0 percent alumina, 10.8 percent ferric oxide and 1.0 percent titania. The bauxite is forming at the present day by direct alteration of the dacite without an intervening clay zone, but the tuffs are kaolinized in the first stage of alteration. It is of high significance that bauxite can develop on small flat elevated areas (50 acres at Lepatuan) during the present weathering cycle. Essential conditions for bauxitic alteration to take place appear to be - (a) high mean temperature, high rainfall and dense vegetation, (b) relatively flat terrain, and (c) elevation above immediate surroundings to ensure adequate ground-water movement. Total resources of bauxite at Lepatuan are about 600,000 tons, and possible reserves are negligible at the other localities. Difficulties of access and distance from markets militate against commercial exploitation of the deposit, but prospects of finding more bauxite in the islands of the volcanic arcs of Bismark Archipelago cannot be lightly dismissed.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of low birthweight live births, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

The data covers the years of 2014-2015 and is aggregated by Local Government Areas (LGA) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). This dataset is part of the Victorian Department of Education and Training's Victorian Child and Adolescent Monitoring System (VCAMS) data release. This dataset is sourced from the School Entrant Health Questionnaire (SEHQ).\nThe VCAMS Framework comprises 150 indicators as agreed by the Children's Service Coordination Board. It incorporates 35 outcomes that relate to aspects of children's health, development, safety, learning and well-being in four categories - the child, families, community, and supports and services.\nFor more information, please visit VCAMS Indicators.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"NDP\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Exclusions were attached to artificial substrata to investigate the relative effects of predation on the development of epifaunal communities at Portsea. Exclusions were black plastic mesh cages enclosing panels that were attached to rigs under the Portsea Pier. Bare control panels and cage controls where included in the experimental design. Cage controls had the bottom and half of the roof on the cage removed. There were 2 replicate panels of each treatment that were immersed for 2, 4 or 7 months and there were 6 runs of the experiment from October 1975 to November 1977. At the conclusion of each run of the experiment the panels were fixed in 4% formalin-seawater solution. In the laboratory, the number of individuals and percent cover of colonial species on each panel were recorded. \n\nSurveys identified that grazing fish were the most abundant predator of the epifaunal community at Portsea during the experiment. Predation significantly affected the pattern of establishment of the epifaunal community. There were fewer ascidian recruits and more diverse communities on bare control panels because fish predation prevented monopolisation of space by dominant ascidian competitors. On caged panels were there was no fish grazing, the survival of colonial ascidians was greater and the panels were dominated by arborescent bryozoans and ascidians.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by CSIRO for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation with research and data support by ABARES.  \r\n\r\n The report develops a framework that can be used to assist managers to cost effectively develop target reference points that are consistent with the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy Policy for multispecies in mixed fisheries. The report addresses the problem of determining appropriate target reference points for target and by-product stocks in multispecies fisheries. The applicability of this framework is demonstrated using a case study fishery, the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. \r\n\r\n The report uses generic logistic and exponential bio-economic models to produce a target reference point consistent with the current management framework taking into consideration a wide range of biological and economic conditions. The output was included in the development of a generic decision support framework using two cost effective approaches: regression tree analysis and the Bayesian Network approach. Sensitivity tests were also conducted on all 4 models. The project also develops a separate set of bio-economic models specific to the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery examining the static and dynamic aspects of maximum economic yield. \r\n\r\n The results from the generic models suggest that the key determinants of the target reference point of individual species in multispecies mixed fisheries are catchability, growth rates and share of total fishery revenue. Other variables, such as costs of fishing, prices and number of species in the fishery are also influential but to a lesser degree. For the case study fishery, both of the cost effective approaches performed well and achieved better results than the current default proxy target reference point. An incidental result from the study is that attempting to impose a target reference point on all species may not be necessary (or feasible) in multispecies fisheries. Instead, imposing a target on the dominant species (in terms of revenue share) for each sub-fleet results in outcomes close to optimal, and reduces conflicts in catches where target reference points are not perfectly aligned.

The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a GCCSA. The number of people who could not be assigned a GCCSA is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for fish in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches for these HWS scenarios:\n\n<ul><li>Current: habitat suitability for fish under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability for fish under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue. </li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability for fish given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.</li></ul>\n\nResults are presented as:\n\n<ul><li>Stacked probabilities, i.e. habitat suitability all 13 native fished species added together. These stacked probability values were used in the HWS to provide a fish value score each reach and sub-catchments.</li><li>Results are also provided for all 22 fish species. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for fish from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.</li></ul>\n\n\n\nHabitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs), and 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. \n\n\n\nFurther reading: Chee et al.

The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "title": "Evidence for a Permian petroleum system in the Timor Sea region, northwestern Australia",
    "description": "Petroleum exploration in the Timor Sea region, Bonaparte Basin, has focussed on plays that are charged and sealed by Mesozoic sediments. However, there is increasing evidence that Palaeozoic oil and gas have contributed to the hydrocarbons found in this area. Geochemical appraisal of the palaeo-oil column at Torrens-1 on the Londonderry High, the gas/condensate reserves in the Petrel and Tern fields in the Petrel Sub-basin, and the gas accumulation at Kelp Deep-1 on the Sahul Platform in the Zone of Co-operation, have revealed that these hydrocarbons are most likely generated from organic-rich Permian sediments.\n\nOil stains and fluid inclusion oil from the Permian Highland Bay and Fossil Head formations at Torrens-1 have similar biomarker compositions indicating a terrestrial source affinity. Carbon isotope values from bulk and compound-specific analyses show that the Fossil Head-reservoired oil is enriched in 13C (13Csat=-26.1 ‰). Despite having lost its lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, the n-alkane isotope profile exhibits a strong negative slope and is similar to the Petrel and Tern condensates reservoired in the Hyland Bay Formation. Onshore in the Petrel Sub-basin, Weaber-4 oil has an isotopic signature enriched in 13C, as observed at Petrel and Tern. These data are distinct from those of the Carboniferous-sourced Barnett/Turtle oils (offshore Petrel Sub-basin) which have  13Csat values in the order of -28 ‰.\n\nDry gas from Kelp Deep-1 in the Hyland Bay Formation has an isotopic composition in keeping with generation from land-plant-rich source rocks, and its stratigraphic and structural position is suggestive of a Permian origin.\n\nPresented at the 2000 AAPG International Conference and Exhibition, Bali",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Northern Rivers catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

    "title": "Schools Apparent Retention Rates, Victoria",
    "description": "A dataset of schools apparent retention rates or ARR, all school sector in Victoria, from census year 2012 to 2023.\nThis dataset is prepared and based on data collected from schools as part of the February School Census conducted on the last school day of February each year. It presents information for all government and non-government schools and student enrolments in Victoria, in particular secondary school years. The majority of the statistical data in this publication is drawn from school administration systems. The dataset includes analysis by school sector and sex, Koorie status, as well as on government schools by region.\nApparent retention rates (ARR) are calculated based on aggregate enrolment data and provide an indicative measurement of student engagement in secondary education. The Department of Education and Training (DET) computes and publishes ARR data at a state-wide and DET region level only.\nThe term \"apparent\" retention rate reflects that retention rates are influenced by factors not taken into account by this measure such as: Student repeating year levels, Interstate and overseas migration, Transfer of students between education sectors or schools, Student who have left school previously, returning to continue their school education.\nThe ARR for year 7 to 12 (ARR 7-12) refers to the Year 12 enrolment expressed as a proportion of the Year 7 enrolment five years earlier. The ARR for year 10 to 12 (ARR 10-12) refers to the Year 12 enrolment expressed as a proportion of the Year 10 enrolment two years earlier.\nPlease note that the ABS calculates apparent retention using the number of full-time school students only whereas at the DET we use the number of full-time equivalent school enrolments. Data reported in the ABS Schools, Australia collection is based on enrolment data collected in August by all jurisdictions.\nThe Department has found that computing ARR at geographical areas smaller than DET regions (e.g. LGA, Postcode) can produce erratic and misleading results that are difficult to interpret or make use of. In small populations, relatively small changes in student numbers can create large movements in apparent retention rates. These populations might include smaller jurisdictions, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and subcategories of the non-government affiliation. There are a number of reasons why apparent rates may generate results that differ from actual rates. \nApparent retention rates provide an indicative measure of the number of full-time school students who have stayed in school, as at a designated year and grade of education. It is expressed as a percentage of the respective cohort group that those students would be expected to have come from, assuming an expected rate of progression of one grade per year.\nProvided ARR is a result of calculation of the whole census and is NOT to be re-calculated by average or sum.",

They were digitised by the City of Melbourne and geo-referenced.\n\n\nThe same maps are avaiilable through the State Library of Victoria: http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/126848\n\n\nTo help you choose between the two sources, here are some of the differences:\n\n- the SLV digitisations are higher quality, with fewer artefacts such as other maps bleeding through\n\n- the SLV has a web viewer, enabling you to quickly view each map online\n\n- the CoM versions are geo-referenced JPEG2000 files, meaning you can overlay them on a map\n\n- the CoM files are available for bulk download\n\n\nThere is no copyright on these map images.",

    "description": "A national connectivity index was developed as an instrument for monitoring and prioritising the maintenance and restoration of Australia’s heavily modified landscapes.  Three fundamental ecologically important elements were identified for combination into a single index.  \n\nFor the connectivity context at any location, the amount of remaining natural area, its condition, and spatial separation were assessed.  Because connectivity applies across multiple scales, these measures were made within circular regions ranging from 500 metres to 32 kilometres in diameter.  A single index of connectivity was developed by combining the three indices at all of the spatial scales.\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhile reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data is licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia for use under a Creative Commons By Attribution 3.0 Australia licence http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\n\nThe data should be cited in publications, products and maps and any other material using this template:\n\nNational Connectivity Index, © Copyright Commonwealth of Australia Department of the Environment and Energy, 2014.\nThis data is licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia for use under a Creative Commons By Attribution 3.0 Australia licence http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\n\nThe data should be cited in publications, products and maps and any other material using this template:\n\nNational Connectivity Index, © Copyright Commonwealth of Australia Department of the Environment and Energy, 2014.",

    "description": "The ISC2010_CHANNEL_TRANSECTS are line features created perpendicular to the river centreline that span the width of ISC2010_BANKFULL_WIDTH polygons. Channel Transects occur every 25m along all reaches. Every fourth Channel Transect coicides with a 100m River Section break. Channel Transects are used to assess and record cross sectional statistics. Channel Transects are represented as two dimensional lines but contain three dimensional cross sectional attributes such as channel area and volume.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) are threatened by coastal development through habitat loss and runoff of sediment, nutrients and pollutants. Future coastal development is difficult to predict because it depends on volatile socio-economic and political factors. With this in mind, we developed a research project that uses spatially explicit scenario planning to identify plausible futures to 2035 for the GBRWHA coastal zone. The method used to produce maps of these scenarios is land-use change modelling using the GIS Idrisi. A governance analysis for the GBR coast is part of the project and is included in the scenario-planning process. Using a conservation planning approach, this project sets out to identify key priorities for restoring and protecting coastal ecosystems in the GBRWHA coastal zone. The objectives are to:\n- Compile spatial data on the coastal ecosystems and socio-economic characteristics of the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Produce spatially explicit land use scenarios for the GBRWHA coastal zone to 2035\n- Analyse the governance system in the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Identify conservation goals for the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Assess impacts of development for assets related to the conservation goals\n- Bring all the above information together to determine spatial options for allocating protection and restoration actions to achieve goals",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, February 04, 2008\nArrived:  \t  Port Adelaide, South Australia, February 26, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The categorisation indicates whether a community was considered to have poorer than average, average, or better than average outcomes from Regional Australia scores for each dimension. This dataset also includes the remoteness classification of the Local Government areas and the population figures for the years 2006, 2011 and 2016.\r\n\r\n## Dataset 2 (Ratings of access to different services and infrastructure, by Local Government Area): \r\nThis dataset identifies average scores for access to services and infrastructure by local government area. There are some limitations to this data: in particular, in less populated areas, there was insufficient sample in some LGAs to analyse data for that LGA on its own. In these cases, the data reported are for 2-4 LGAs of similar remoteness, located adjacent to each other, with the average score for respondents in those two to four LGAs.\r\n\r\n## Dataset 3 (Population , Economic Diversity, Dependence on agriculture, and drought incidence): \r\nThis dataset covers population figures for 2006 and 2016,  changes in economic diversity , changes in dependence on agriculture, irrigation dependence and Drought severity on the LGAs\r\n\r\n## Source:\r\nSchirmer J and Mylek M (2020) Thriving, surviving, or declining communities: socio-economic change in Murray–Darling Basin communities, report to the the Panel for the Independent Assessment of Social and Economic Conditions in the Murray–Darling Basin. Raw data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for the years 2006, 2011, and 2016, Hutchinson Drought Severity Index from 2001 to 2018, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) for the year 2017 and Regional Wellbeing Survey (RWS) 2018 are used to develop the datasets in this Sheet.\r\n\r\n## Note:\r\nThe Regional Wellbeing Survey is open to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants, and each year around 100 to 150 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people participate in the survey. However, this is a small sample, and the survey does not currently include some topics known to be important to the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people – for example, topics examining connection to country, or experiences of racism. This means the Regional Wellbeing Survey can provide some insight but not a comprehensive understanding of factors important to the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders\" (Schirmer, J, Mylek, M, Peel, D, Yabsley, B (2015) People and Communities, The 2014 Regional Wellbeing Survey, Report 1 People and Communities, University of Canberra). \r\n\r\n# Estimated Residential Population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the MDB\r\n\r\n## License: \r\nThis publication is provided under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

    "description": "The 2024-25 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. The 2024-25 Budget was tabled in the Parliament on Tuesday, 14 May 2024 (Budget night).\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2024-25 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available \r\n   after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) will be available (~8.30pm Budget night)\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2024-25 Budget.\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\nInformation about the PBS Excel files and CSV: The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers (No.1) and (No.4) in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2024-25 Budget Measures\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2024-25 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).

    "description": "An ArcGIS shapefile layer showing the extent of all extant and relic Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies at Whitney Point, Windmill Islands, February 2006. The field 'Status' describes each polygon as extant, relic or maximum. Extant refers to the area used by breeding birds in the summer 2005/06. Maximum refers to the historic maximal extent of the colony. Relic refers to any colony which was not occupied by any breeding pairs during 2005/06.\n\nPositional accuracy is approx. 1-2 m, after accounting for dGPS errors and errors in identification of the boundaries of colonies. Mapping was conducted after the end of the breeding season, so boundaries were identified as the extent of nest pebbles/fresh faeces, and it was considered that they could be reliably identified to within 0.5m.\n\nData were acquired using a Trimble Pro XH differential GPS. This work was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\n\nAlso for this project, three aerial photographs of Whitney point showing the adelie penguin  colonies and taken on 17 December 1990 were georeferenced.\n\nThese aerial photographs are film ANTC1219 run 54 frames 21 to 23.\n\nWork on this project also utilised a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) created for Shirley Island.  See the metadata record, 'A digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto of the Whitney Point area of the Windmill Islands, Antarctica' for more information (linked below).\n\nSince the 2005/06 summer was a low-ice year the opportunity was also taken to survey with differential GPS a section of coastline about 230 metres long east of Whitney Point on Clark Peninsula. This section of coastline was ice free and accessible. The data was collected with differential GPS on 10 February 2006.",

This is due to data availability from July 2014 to allow a full financial year moving rate calculation. The ABS publishes estimates of youth unemployment, youth underemployment and overall underemployment in original terms only. Original data is usually highly volatile and should be used with caution. The unemployment rate and underemployment rate for young people as well as overall underemployment can vary significantly in a short period and is subject to relatively high error as it is derived from a small sample. Hence, the data for unemployment rate and underemployment rate for young people as well as overall underemployment are presented in the 12-month moving average terms in order to show the underlying trends of these indicators.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC13) was collected from a depth of 1482 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~90cm into the core. Two samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; from the sediment surface (GC13-0) representing interglacial sediment, while the second sample, from 90cm (GC13-90) represents glacial sediment. XRD analysis of these samples show a slight increase in carbonate percentage during the interglacial compared to the glacial, with increased clay and quartz during the glacial. During the interglacial there are minor amounts of Mg calcite, which suggests that there is little influence from the reef platform on the sediments during the present sea-level, or that the core is presently below the Mg calcite compensation depth.",

Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

    "description": "Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Catchments comprises two related views of hydrological catchments to be used for analysis and reporting purposes. Firstly, a topological network view of hydrological catchments represented as a simplified node-link network using a subset of the contracted nodes (AHGFNode) and the links (AHGFLink) between them; and secondly, a catchments view of the hydrology using the contracted catchments (AHGFContractedCatchment). The AHGFNode feature class contains contracted nodes that are points of hydrological significance that carry identity. They include the confluence of major named streams, coastal stream termini, waterbody inflow and outflows and inland sinks. It also contains a new class of node called diffuse nodes that represent diffused flow from groups of nodes at coastal, delta or inter-catchment outlets. The AHGFLink feature class provides the topological connectors between a subset of contracted nodes that participate in the simplified node-link network. The AHGFContractedCatchment feature class contains catchment polygons (that are aggregations of AHGFCatchments) for the subset of contracted nodes that participate in the simplified node link network. These catchments are part of a hierarchy that can be aggregated based on upstream relationships. This product contains five feature types including: Node, Link, Contracted Catchment, Node-Link Connectivity (upstream), and Node-Link Connectivity (downstream).",

Please note the following: Student enrolment numbers are based on the census of government school students undertaken on the first Friday of August 2017. \nFor more information visit the NSW Education Data Hub.\nPlease Note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSchool information, such as addresses and contact details, are updated regularly as required, and are the most current source of information.\n\n\nData is suppressed for indigenous and language backgrounds other than English (LBOTE) percentages where student numbers are equal to, or less than five.\n\n\nNational Schools Collection (NSSC) out of scope schools will not have an enrolment figure.\n\n\nNSSC and LBOTE figures are updated annually in March.\n\n\nIndex of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) values are updated every April with the previous year's ICSEA values. The master dataset is currently displaying 2016 figures. Small schools, Schools for Specific Purposes (SSPs) and Senior Secondary schools do not have their ICSEA values published by The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA).\n\n\nFollowing the introduction of part-time study in secondary schools in 1993, student enrolments are generally reported in full-time equivalent units (FTE). The FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.\n\n\nNorfolk Island Central School (NICS) is not a NSW government school. NICS is operated by the Australian government. The NSW Department of Education provides school education services under an agreement with the Australian government.\n\n\nFor more information visit NSW Education Data Hub",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in New South Wales (NSW), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of New South Wales connected by Sydney trains (T1-T9) and Metro services (Metro North West line) have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending September 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Guilderton.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe FRE HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 285 deg true east of north (approximately west by north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "This line (polyline) dataset was extracted from OpenStreetMap across the geographic area of Australia on 21 May 2018. It has been pruned to include only those features that have been deemed to be publicly traversable (e.g., streets and footpaths). Note, however, as this dataset is built by a community of mappers, there is no guarantee of its spatial or attribute accuracy. Use at your own risk. Please contact AURIN if you would like to obtain a list of features that have been pruned from the original dataset that were deemed not traversable. Also note that due to changes in tagging, previous AURIN versions of this dataset are not comparable with this release. For more information about the map features represented in this dataset (including their attributes), refer to the OpenStreetMap Wiki. You are free to use this dataset for any purpose as long as you credit OpenStreetMap and its contributors. OpenStreetMap contributors maintain data about roads, trails, railway stations, and much more. Emphasising local knowledge, OpenStreetMap's community is diverse, passionate, and growing every day. Their contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers running the OSM servers, and more. If you find any errors/omissions in this dataset, please update OpenStreetMap to ensure it can be communicated to the broader community. This dataset was downloaded from Geofabrik on 7 April 2017. ",

    "description": "The ED (emergency department) is a hospital or primary health care service that provides initial treatment to patients with a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be life-threatening and require immediate attention. EDs provide rapid assessment and management of critical illnesses. After initial assessment and treatment, patients are either admitted to the hospital, stabilised and transferred to another hospital for various reasons, or discharged (Australasian College of Emergency Medicine).Upon arrival in the ED, people usually undergo a brief triage, or interview, to help determine the nature and severity of their illness. Individuals with serious illnesses are then seen by a physician more rapidly than those with less severe symptoms or injuries. The data includes patient attendances, admissions and admissions by Triage for 1 June 2013 to 30 June 2014. Definitions include: Attendances - the number of patients recorded as arriving at a public emergency department. Admissions - the number of patients who are subsequently admitted to the hospital for care and/or treatment. Triage categories are allocated to each patient based on an assessment of their presenting conditions, generally by the triage nurse, with triage 1 being the most urgent and triage 5 being the least urgent. (Triage 1: Resuscitation- immediate, within seconds; Triage 2: Emergency- within 10 minutes; Triage 3: Urgent- within 30 minutes; Triage 4: Semi-urgent- within 60 minutes; Triage 5: Non-urgent - within 120 minutes).

    "description": "This dataset presents information about the agricultural exposure of Australia for each financial year in the 2010 - 2015 period following the National Exposure Information System (NEXIS) valuation. This data is aggregated by the 2011 Australian Statistical Geographical Standard (ASGS) Statictical Area Level 1 (SA1) boundaries.\nThe NEXIS Agricultural Exposure web service is a set of ABS Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) and Local Government Areas (LGA) polygon layers providing national agricultural exposure information.\nNEXIS Agriculture Exposure integrates the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Gross Value of Agricultural Commodities Produced (VACP) by Statistical Area 1(SA1) with the Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) cadastral parcels in areas identified as suitable for agricultural production. The purpose of the data is to provide Agricultural Exposure information at a high resolution, the cadastral parcel level, as an aid to decision making. The agriculture value estimates are derived by the multiplication of price and quantity estimates of agricultural commodities. Price information refers to the average unit value of a given commodity realised in the market place. Price information for livestock slaughtering and wool is obtained from ABS collections. Price information for other commodities is obtained from non-ABS sources, including marketing authorities and industry sources. NEXIS Agriculture Exposure is underlined by a bespoke land use classification method which enables the agricultural exposure data to be applied only against land classified as 'Agricultural'.\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal or the Nexis Agriculture Exposure Metadata Document.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-02-15\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women giving birth for the first time who gave birth by caesarean section. This has been calculated with the number of selected females giving birth for the first time who gave birth by caesarean section, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as the event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nCaesarean section is an operative procedure to remove the baby through an incision through a female's abdomen and uterus.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births was included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The information contained in the maps is based on the best available knowledge and understanding at the time of production.

Using the 20cm multibeam and a new digital filterbank array this survey will create a petabyte digital record of the sky that can be data mined in the future and used to search for relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars, RRATs, and extragalactic radio bursts. The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who did not see or delayed seeing a GP due to cost in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "title": "EPA Victoria Groundwater Quality Restriction Use Zones (GQRUZ) - Location Points",
    "description": "Groundwater Quality Restricted Use Zones (GQRUZ) are areas where there has been historic groundwater pollution as a result of previous industrial or other activities. These zones have been subject to clean up in line with the relevant environmental standards. However, restrictions remain on what the water can be used for if it is extracted via a groundwater bore.\n\nA GQRUZ remains when attempts have been made to clean up the groundwater at the affected site, but full clean-up was not possible - as it is often difficult to remove 100 per cent of groundwater pollution. It also may be impractical to clean up groundwater to the level needed to restore it to its original condition. EPA then identifies restrictions that should remain on how the water can be used without further treatment.\n\nGQRUZ do not represent a comprehensive list of all sites where groundwater quality may not be suitable for use. Rather, they represent locations where EPA has formally recognised that groundwater is polluted, following site investigations under EPA's environmental audit program. Other sources of information on groundwater quality include EPA's Priority Sites Register, which lists sites which are currently undergoing clean-up under EPA's compliance and enforcement activities.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the GQRUZ data published. EPA will not be held liable or responsible for any errors, or for any loss incurred from reliance on this data. Further information about a GQRUZ can be found in the audit report for the selected site.\n\nThis dataset mirrors the GQRUZ data available on EPA's website interaction portal, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date data, go to EPA's website interaction portal.",

The data is categorised hourly aside from 1AM – 4AM which is a single category. \nA trip is defined as the travel between two main activities, where a stop may constitute a change in transport mode. As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 ‘stops’ and two ‘trips’. \nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday.",
