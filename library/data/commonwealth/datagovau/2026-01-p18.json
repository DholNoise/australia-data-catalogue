Data is for 2010–11 and 2015–16, and the associated change between the two years.\r\n\r\nNon-agricultural land uses are mapped using seven thematic layers, derived from existing datasets provided by states and territories, and external agencies. The seven layers are:\r\n\r\n* protected areas\r\n* topographic features\r\n* land tenure\r\n* forest cover\r\n* catchment-scale land use\r\n* urban boundaries\r\n* stock routes.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural land uses are based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ 2010–11 and 2015–16 agricultural census data; with spatial distributions modelled using MODIS satellite imagery and training data, assisted by spatial constraint layers for cultivation, horticulture, and irrigation.\r\n\r\nLand use is specified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8. The same method is applied to both time points using representative national datasets for each period, where available. All rasters are in GeoTIFF format with geographic coordinates in Geocentric Datum of Australian 1994 (GDA94) and a 0.002197 degree (~250 metre) cell size.\r\n\r\nThe Land use of Australia 2010–11 to 2015–16 data package is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program.",

    "title": "Cost of production - Australian beef cattle and sheep producers 2012-13 to 2014-15",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents and discusses cost of production estimates for beef cattle and sheep producers for the three years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The on-farm cost of beef production on a per kilogram live weight basis increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15, as producers increased farm expenditure in 2014-15 in response to the much higher prices received for beef cattle. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, producers pared back expenditure on beef inputs to a minimum in response to low beef cattle prices in an attempt to maintain operating margins (receipts per kilogram less costs of production). \r\n• The largest increase in production costs occurred in northern Australia, where many beef producers were also subject to dry seasonal conditions in 2013-14 and 2014-15. This resulted in increased expenditure on fodder and freight. Overall, the total cost of production increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15 by 33 cents per kilogram live weight in northern Australia and by 25 cents in southern Australia. \r\n• Total costs of production averaged over the three years ending 2014-15 were similar in southern and northern Australia, at 174 cents per kilogram live weight in southern Australia and 175 cents in northern Australia. Northern Australia includes Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley, Pilbara and Murchison-Gascoyne regions of Western Australia. All other regions are included in southern Australia. \r\n• Higher beef cattle prices in 2014-15 resulted in operating margins increasing relative to the very low margins recorded in 2013-14. However, expenditure on farm inputs increased, so operating margins were similar to those recorded in 2012-13. \r\n• The average on-farm cost of sheep production on a per kilogram live weight basis remained largely unchanged between 2012-13 and 2014-15. \r\n• The average cost of production for beef cattle and sheep producers for the period 2012-13 to 2014-15 decreased as production size increased, which indicates that significant economies of size exist in beef and sheep meat production. These economies of size would be an incentive to expand beef and sheep meat production to enhance profitability. \r\n• Economies of size for sheep producers appear to result mainly from larger sheep enterprises using farm capital and labour more efficiently. However, for beef producers, cash operating costs for larger herd size producers were lower than those for smaller producers and they used farm capital and labour more efficiently. \r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "This data represents the raw data captured in the 2015 Anthropometric Survey of the Royal Australian Navy (ASRAN), as well as the data embedded in the Multivariate Virtual Fit Test. The ASRAN data provides 87 measurements, collected digitally and manually on 1322 Permanent Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel (232 females and 1090 males), aged 18–54 years. It can be used for the design and evaluation of vessels, systems, equipment and clothing. This data can be used to conduct multivariate anthropometric analyses and to determine precise levels of fit and accommodation based on the anthropometry. Note that it is always recommended to consider the inclusion of secular change, personal equipment and clothing correction factors, and other allowances that should be considered when using the anthropometric data (comfort, movement, posture etc). \r\n\r\nThe Multivariate Virtual Fit Test has ASRAN data embedded in it, and supports the conduct of multivariate analyses. This tool developed by Prof Matthew Parkinson and Dr Matthew Reed can be used to predict accommodation in clothing, systems or platforms where body dimensions are independent of each other (e.g., how many people have a stature of x and a bideltoid breadth of y). It is very valuable to demonstrate the decreasing accommodation that occurs when using the historical 5th and 95th percentile values across multiple anthropometric dimensions.\r\n",

Regulations require decision-makers to notify the Council of any proposals that may affect a place under consideration for registration.\n\nThe State Register of Heritage Places recognises a place's value and importance to Western Australia. It includes buildings, structures, gardens, cemeteries, landscapes and archaeological sites and has more than 1,300 places listed in it. The State Register is managed by the Heritage Council and provides a place with statutory protection to ensure that any proposed demolition, relocation, subdivision, amalgamation, alteration, addition or new development is in harmony with its cultural heritage values. The State Register continues to expand, as significant places yet to be registered are progressively assessed by the Council.\n\nFor more information contact the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage on (08) 6551 8002 or see https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-planning-lands-and-heritage.",

    "description": "This GIS dataset is the product of a survey of penguin colony boundaries at Bechervaise Island by Lisa Meyer of the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) in February 2000. \r\n\r\nFor each boundary point Lisa measured the distance from a surveyed metal pole to the boundary point of a penguin colony and then took a bearing with a compass back to the pole. The boundary point locations were calculated by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre from the distances and bearings using the UTM Zone 41 grid. \r\n\r\nThe metal poles had been surveyed during the 1999/2000 summer season as described by the metadata record 'Bechervaise Island - Survey of penguin colony markers and some infrastructure'.\r\n\r\nLyn Irvine of the AAD identified whether the penguin colony points were nests, colony markers or other boundary points.\r\n\r\nMap 13042 in the SCAR Map Catalogue displays the penguin colony boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe nests in penguin colonies K, L and Q were surveyed in February 2002 as described by the metadata record 'Adelie Penguin nest locations on Bechervaise Island'.",

This would provide residents with a 30-minute public transport service to their nearest strategic centre seven days a week.\nThe image below shows the thirty minute city catchments to the different strategic centre catchments.  \n\nThe Thirty Minute City and Metro Strategic Centre Catchments Document provides you with detailed information regards the background of this initiative and the datasets used.",

    "description": "The Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) sub-facility provides high temporal resolution observations in sub-Antarctic waters.  Observations are broad and include measurements of physical, chemical and biogeochemical parameters from multiple deep-water moorings.  The emphasis is on inter-annual variations of upper ocean properties and their influence on exchange with the deep ocean.  The time-series provided permit investigation into issues of ocean physics and chemistry, climate change, carbon cycling and biogeochemical controls on marine productivity.  These moorings provide cost-effective observations and overcome the infrequent availability of ships in the region.  \n\nThe SOTS site is located in the sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ), southwest of Tasmania, near 47S, 142E. SOTS observations are made from\n1) a deep ocean sediment trap mooring, used to collect sinking particles to quantify carbon transports.  This mooring also provides current meter measurements and a deep ocean CTD to measure heat contents below the depth of ARGO profiling float measurements.\n2) the Pulse biogeochemistry mooring, used to measure upper ocean carbon cycle and phytoplankton productivity processes included sensor measurements of dissolved gases (O2, N2) and bio-optical properties.  This mooring also collects water samples for measures of dissolved carbon and nutrients, and phytoplankton microscopic identification.\n3) additional biogeochemical sensors (CO2, O2, bio-optical, and bio-acoustic devices) mounted on the nearby Southern Ocean Flux Station air-sea flux mooring (and managed by the Air-Sea Flux Stations sub-facility).",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Hobart in TAS with SA2 code 601051027, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset contains historical readings for soil sensors within parks across the City of Melbourne. The sensors take a variety of readings such as salinity, temperature and moisture. The units and readings are included within the data. This dataset can be joined to the soil sensor locations dataset using the site id column. This dataset contains a large number of records, to download only a particular sensor's readings see our attached guide on how to filter data.\nDifferent readings taken (based on unit column):- %VWC: Volumetric water content is a numerical measure of soil moisture. It is simply the ratio of water volume to soil volume.- ºC: Temperature in degrees celsius.- µS/cm: Salinity is the measure of the concentration of dissolved (soluble) salts in water from all sources. (microseimens per centimetre)Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every hour as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.",

    "description": "AUV Sirius (IMOS Platform code: SIRIUS) was part of a three week research cruise in September 2007 aboard the R/V Southern Surveyor documenting drowned shelf edge reefs at multiple sites in four areas along the Great Barrier Reef.  \n\nSirius documented relic reefs up to 20k years old formed during previous ice ages when sea levels were up to 100m lower than today. Broad scale bathymetric mapping was used to confirm if the reefs are consistent geomorphic features and to define patterns of past reef growth. \n\nSites for targeted dredging, sub-bottom profiling and AUV imaging were then selected for detailed study of particular features.  \n\nAll activities were undertaken during a 21-day cruise aboard the R/V Southern Surveyor, Australia's Marine National Facility operated by CSIRO. \n\nThe study of these structures may yield insights regarding potential future sea level changes and their potential impact on sensitive reef areas such as the GBR.",

    "title": "Warra Flux Data Release 2022_v2",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.7) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\n<em>Eucalyptus obliqua</em> forests dominate the vegetation below 650&nbsp;m where they exist as fire-maintained communities. On fertile soils these forests attain mature heights in excess of 55&nbsp;m: the tallest <em>E. obliqua</em> reaches a height of 90&nbsp;m. The flux station is installed in a stand of tall, mixed-aged <em>E. obliqua</em> forest (77 and &gt;250 years-old) with a rainforest understorey and a dense man-fern (<em>Dicksonia antarctica</em>) ground-layer, on a small flat of elevation 100&nbsp;m adjacent to the Huon River. The understorey vegetation progresses from wet sclerophyll (dominated by <em>Pomaderris apatala</em> and <em>Acacia dealbata</em>) to rainforest (dominated by <em>Nothofagus cunninghamii</em>, <em>Atherosperma moschatum</em>, <em>Eucryphia lucida</em> and <em>Phyllocladus aspleniifolius</em>) with increasing time intervals between fire events. The site supports prodigous quantities of coarse woody debris as is characteristic of these fire-maintained eucalypt forests on fertile sites in southern Tasmania. The soil at the flux site is derived from Permian mudstone and has a gradational profile with a dark brown organic clayey silt topsoil overlying a yellow brown clay. The climate is classified as temperate with a mild summer and no dry season. Mean annual precipitation is 1700&nbsp;mm with a relatively uniform seasonal distribution. Summer temperatures peak in January (8.4&nbsp;°C to 19.2&nbsp;°C) with winter temperatures reaching their lowest in July (2.6&nbsp;°C to 8.4&nbsp;°C).\n\nThe instruments are mounted at the top of an 80&nbsp;m tall guyed steel lattice tower. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation. An open-path gas analyser (EC150) was replaced by a closed-path gas analyser (EC155) at the end of January 2015. Soil moisture content is measured using time domain reflectometry. Soil heat fluxes and temperature are also measured. Micro-meteorology (CO2, H2O, energy fluxes) and meteorology (temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rainfall) were measured from 2013 to late 2016, but the dataset is incomplete due to ongoing problems since changing the open-path IRGA to a closed path system (CPEC200) during 2015. Soil data (moisture, heat flux, temperature) are complete for the time period.",

    "description": "The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) was developed to ensure a fair, efficient and transparent allocation of the state public education budget for every school. The model recognises that students and school communities are not all the same and that they have different needs which require different levels of support.\nData Notes:\n\n\nAnticipated Budget for each school subject to actual school enrolments. \n\n\nRAM funding represents the total funding for the four equity loadings and the three base allocation loadings, a total of seven loadings. The equity loadings are socio-economic, Aboriginal background, English language proficiency and low-level adjustment for disability. The base loadings are location, professional learning and per capita. \n\n\nThe RAM funding table provides a sum total of the seven loadings for each NSW public school. \n\n\nEvery school receives a School Budget Allocation Report (SBAR) in October showing the full school funding allocation for the following year. This includes each school's allocations for the seven loadings of the RAM as well as staffing and operational funding. \n\n\nEvery school receives School Budget Allocation Report (SBAR) Adjustments in April/May confirming the full school funding allocation for the current year.\n\n\nChanges in school funding are the result of changes to student needs and/or student enrolments.\n\n\nData is refreshed after each SBAR cycle.\n\n\nFor more information on the RAM, visit  Schools funding.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nStrategic Schools Resourcing.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women giving birth for the first time who gave birth by instrumental vaginal birth, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of selected females giving birth for the first time who gave birth by instrumental vaginal birth, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nAn instrumental birth is a procedure that uses instruments (forceps or vacuum extraction) to assist the baby to come out through the vagina.\n\n\nInstrumental vaginal births include forceps and vacuum extraction.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013.

    "description": "IEC2021_ FRINGING _VEG is the spatial representation of fringing vegetation used in the calculation of Index of Estuarine Condition (IEC) scores. In the context of the IEC, 'fringing vegetation' refers to the vegetation which grows above the permanently inundated portion of the estuary but within the zone of influence of the more-or-less saline estuarine waters. It includes vegetation in intertidal areas and riparian areas in the estuary but not subtidal vegetation (see Sinclair and Kohout 2018 for more precise working definitions of vegetation zones). In the field, the extent of the fringing vegetation and any built structures that impinge on it were mapped (by annotating an aerial photograph). Fringing vegetation was mapped according to Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVC) (https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/biodiversity/bioregions-and-evc-benchmarks) and subjectively classified into areas of different condition with reference to vegetation structure, weediness and land use. Each patch of vegetation that could be accessed was scored for its degree of invasion by perennial weeds and its structural resemblance to a relevant benchmark (https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/biodiversity/bioregions-and-evc-benchmarks). Additional observations were recorded on the score sheet, relating to <code>Health of the dominant plant species¿ and</code>Extent of engineered hydrological modifications¿. Scores were estimated for the areas that could not be observed. These estimated scores were based on the areas that were observed. The areas of all relevant polygons were calculated, and a score produced for each metric (IEC Report 2021).",

The Study area was the floodplain of the River Murray and its anabranches, including the Edward-Wakool system, from below Hume Dam to the upper end of Lake Alexandrina, a total of nearly 9,000 square kilometres (900,000 hectares).  The survey was conducted by Margules and Partners Pty Ltd, P and J Smith Ecological Consultants, and the then Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (DCFL).  The results were then compiled by DCFL, a report published (see References) and a GIS was constructed.\nPlease note that the vegetation mapping uses a mixed floristic/structural classification.\nVIS_ID 3964",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2015 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

The mapping was to be completed using Land and Property Information high resolution digital photography. At the time the project was commissioned, aerial photography available for the study area was limited to the LGA-wide 2009 series (used for the 2011 vegetation mapping project). The project commenced in November 2017 using 2009 aerial photography, along with September 2012 imagery limited to the rural villages of Modanville, Dunoon and Nimbin. From May 2018 onwards, the project used high resolution aerial photography taken in April 2018.\nDisclaimer\nThis vegetation mapping is provided on the understanding that Lismore City Council is not responsible for the results of any action on the basis of any information or for any error in or omission from this information.

It consists of lines spaced at 1km intervals, running north-south (attributed with Easting) and east-west (attributed with Northing). It is applicable for use where a VicGrid graticule based on the AGD66 datum is required. Can be projected to provide a Vicgrid (AGD66) graticule over data based on other co-ordinate systems (eg Geographic or AMG).\nThis dataset forms part of a series of graticule layers, one for each common projection.",

    "description": "The Cape Grim program, established by the Australian Government to monitor and study global atmospheric composition, is a joint responsibility of the Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station began taking samples of the atmosphere over twenty years ago. Since the first sampling began in April 1976, there have been more that 3 billion measurements taken. Among these are measurements of green house gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide as well as chemicals which deplete the ozone layer.  Since the station first began in 1976, a 10% increase in carbon dioxide (one of the main greenhouse gases) has been measured. In addition long term records of aerosol particulates, radon and solar radiation have been obtained. As well as monitoring a wide range of atmospheric trace gases, Cape Grim measures concentrations of natural and anthropogenic particles, and meteorological parameters including wind speed and direction, rainfall, temperature, humidity and air pressure. Sophisticated measurements of solar radiation, including harmful UV-B radiation, are also carried out.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of offences recorded on the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP). Recorded offences include any criminal act or omission by a person or organisation for which a penalty could be imposed by the Victorian legal system. The data spans the years ending September in the period of 2008 to 2017 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe CSA recorded crime collection includes all offences that are reported to, and detected by, Victoria Police and recorded on the LEAP database. The scope and coverage of the data, however, is not representative of all crime that occurs in Victoria. Some crimes may not be recorded on LEAP, not be reported to police, or the responsibility for responding to certain offences may lie with another agency. Recorded offence data are compiled on the basis of the date that the offence was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the offence was detected by, or reported to police. The creation date may not be the date when the offence occurred, or the date when the offence came to the attention of police.\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRecorded crime statistics are based on data extracted by Victoria police on the 18th day after the reference period, and are subject to movement between releases.\n\n\nThe offences in the dataset are grouped according to the CSA offence classification.\n\n\nThe data excludes offences recorded at Justice institutions and immigration facilities, Unincorporated Victoria and where the geographic location is unknown or outside of Victoria.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, sensitive offence counts for subdivisions 'A10 Homicide and related offences' and 'A30 Sexual offences' with a value of 1 to 3 are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2015 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This is a single sensor, multiple swath SSTskin product for three consecutive night-time periods, derived using observations from the AVHRR instrument on the NOAA-XX satellites. It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70°E to 170°W, 20°N to 70°S.  Only night time passes are included in the product. Each grid cell contains the 3 night average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data/product-informa\ntion/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products.  Matchups with buoy SST observations (adjusted to skin depths) indicate typical 2014 biases of &lt; 0.1 degC and standard deviations of 0.5 degC to 0.6 degC for NOAA-18 and NOAA-19.  Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.",

    "description": "Water quality parameters that are measured by field teams at various sampling points within the Murray-Darling Basin on discrete dates as part of the CEWH's Flow-MER program.\r\n\r\nIncludes measures of:\r\n\r\n* discharge\r\n* ecosystem respiration\r\n* gross primary productivity\r\n* water velocity\r\n* chlorophyll a\r\n* total nitrogen\r\n* nitrate and nitrite\r\n* ammonium\r\n* total phosphorus\r\n* filterable reactive phosphorus\r\n* dissolved organic carbon\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWO (2024) Water Quality Measurements.

    "title": "AIHW - Health Risk Factors - Adults who are Overweight Crude (%) (PHN) 2011-2015",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who are overweight. Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2007.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Bangalay Sand Forest is a threatened ecological community (TEC) associated with coastal sand plains found in the Sydney Basin and South East Corner bioregions. The most common tree species are Eucalyptus botryoides (bangalay) and Banksia integrifolia (coast banksia). The understorey is characterised by a mix of sclerophyll and mesophyll species. \nIn this report, we focus on the distribution of this TEC in the NSW South Coast region, an area that extends from Sydney to the Victorian border. This study assesses whether Bangalay Sand Forest is located within the 350,000 hectares of state forest found in our southern study area.\nOur interpretation of Bangalay Sand Forest (BASF) was informed by the six previously described vegetation communities cited in the final determination that were relevant to the South Coast region. Four are eucalypt-dominated forests and one a coastal scrub dominated by Banksia integrifolia and Leptospermum species. An additional community has a mixed canopy composition for which the final determination includes a qualifying statement to exclude stands dominated by Casuarina glauca.\nInitially we examined existing maps of coastal sand landforms and geology along with available vegetation maps to determine the likely extent of habitats suitable to support the presence of the TEC within state forest. We reviewed candidate areas that were within or proximate to state forests using interpretation of high-resolution digital aerial imagery as a basis for planning field surveys. We identified a small number of areas in Termeil and East Boyd State Forests that were plausible locations for BASF and an additional two areas in Nullica and Mogo State Forests identified from existing vegetation mapping. Sites that had not already been subject to field survey were visited and were either systematically sampled or were rejected on site where the species composition and landform were clearly mapping inaccuracies (e.g. estuarine mudflat)\nOur analyses of plot data assigned 66 plots (out of 8452) to Bangalay Sand Forest, based on allocation to a previously defined community cited in the final determination and agreed substrate qualifiers. We used plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables to develop a Random Forest (RF) presence-absence model of the probability of occurrence of Bangalay Sand Forest across the study area. We used the RF model and the locations of plot data to further assess whether Bangalay Sand Forest occurred on state forest.\nWe found no evidence of Bangalay Sand Forest occurring on any state forest within our study area based on the results of our field surveys, analysis of plot data, review of existing map data and predictive models.

    "description": "This data was collected in March2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022010.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, March 15, 2010\nArrived:  \t Hobart, Australia, March 24, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

This data has been derived primarily from GEODATA TOPO 250K Series 1 and contains the following features: State borders, roads, railways, populated places, rivers and lakes, coastline and islands, bathymetric and land contours, and spot locations.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe key source for production of the Builtup Areas, Drainage, Framework, Localities, Rail Transport, Road Transport and Waterbodies layers was the GEODATA TOPO 250K Series 1 product. Some revision of the Builtup Areas, Road Transport, Rail Transport and Waterbodies layers was carried out using the latest available satelite imagery. The primary source for the Spot Heights, Contours and Offshore layers was the GEODATA TOPO 10M Version 1 product. A further element to the production of GEODATA TOPO 10M 2002 has been the datum shift from the Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66) to the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (GDA94).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2013) GEODATA TOPO 10M 2002.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nThis dataset is a complete state-wide digital land use map of Queensland. The dataset is a product of the Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) and was produced by the Queensland Government. It presents the most current mapping of land use features for Queensland, including the land use mapping products from 1999, 2006 and 2009, in a single feature layer. This dataset was last updated July 2012. See additional information also.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nIndicates the current primary use or management objective of the land.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nSource DataQueensland Government - Land use mapping (1999); Landsat TM and ETM imagery; Spot5 imagery; High resolution ortho photography through the Spatial Imagery Subscription Plan (SISP); Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) (2009), Queensland Valuation and Sales Database (QVAS) (2009); Queensland Nature Refuges (2009); Queensland Estates (2009); Queensland Herbarium's Regional Ecosystem, Water Body and Wetlands datasets (2009); Statewide Landcover & Trees Study (SLATS) Queensland Dams and Waterbodies (2009) and land cover change data; scanned aerial photography (1999-2009).Additional verbal & written information on land uses & their locations was obtained from regional Queensland Government officers, Local Government Authorities, land owners & managers, private industry as well as from field observations & checking.Data captureA range of existing digital datasets containing land use information was collated from the Queensland Government spatial data inventory and prepared for use in a GIS using ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine software.Processing steps To compile the 1999 baseline mapping, datasets containing baseline land cover (supplied by SLATS), Protected Areas, State Forest and Timber Reserves, plantations, coastal wetlands, reserves (from DCDB) and logged forests were interpreted in a spatial model to produce a preliminary land use raster image.The model incorporated a decision matrix which assigned each pixel a specific land use class according to a set of pre-determined rules.Individual catchments were clipped from the model output and enhanced with additional land use information interpreted primarily from Landsat TM and ETM imagery as well as scanned and hardcopy aerial photography (where available). The DCDB and other datasets containing land use information were used to help identify property and land use type boundaries. This process produced a draft land use raster.Verification of the draft land use dataset, particularly those with significant areas of intensive land uses, was undertaken by comparing mapped land use classes with observed land use classes in the field where possible. The final raster image was converted to a vector coverage in ARC/Info and GIS editing performed.The existing 1999 baseline (or later where available) land use dataset (vector) formed the basis for the 2006 and 2009 land use mapping. The 2006 & 2009 datasets were then updated primarily by interpretation of SPOT5 imagery, high-res orthophotography, scanned aerial photography and inclusion of expert local knowledge. This was performed in an ESRI ArcSDE geodatabase replication infrastructure, across some nine regional offices. The DCDB, QVAS, Estates, Queensland Herbarium wetlands and SLATS land cover change and waterbody datasets were used to assist in identification and delineation of property and land use type boundaries. Digitised areas of uniform land use type were assigned to land use classes according to ALUMC Version 7 (May 2010).This \"current\" land use mapping product presents a complete state-wide land use map of Queensland, after collating the most current land use datasets within a single mapping layer.An independent validation was undertaken to assess thematic (attribute) accuracy under the ALUM classification. Please refer to the orignal source data for the validation results.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nQueensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts (2013) Bioregional_Assessment_Programme_Land use mapping - Queensland current.

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Loxton site was established in August 2008 and decommissioned in June 2009. The orchard was divided into 10&nbsp;ha blocks (200&nbsp;m by 500&nbsp;m with the long axis aligned north–south) and the flux tower was situated at 34.47035&nbsp;°S and 140.65512&nbsp;°E near the middle of the northern half of a block of trees. The topography of the site was slightly undulating and the area around the tower had a slope of less than 1.5&nbsp;°. The orchard was planted in 2000 with an inter-row spacing of 7&nbsp;m and a within row spacing of 5&nbsp;m. Tree height in August 2008 was 5.5&nbsp;m. The study block consists of producers, Nonpareil, planted every other row, and pollinators planted as alternating rows of Carmel, Carmel and Peerless, and Carmel and Price. All varieties were planted on Nemaguard rootstock. All but 31&nbsp;ha of the surrounding orchard was planted between 1999 and 2002. Nutrients were applied via fertigation. Dosing occurred between September and November and in April with KNO3, Urea, KCl, and NH4NO3 applied at annual rates of 551, 484, 647, and 113&nbsp;kg/ha, respectively. The growth of ground cover along the tree line was suppressed with herbicides throughout the year. Growth in the mid-row began in late winter and persisted until herbicide application in late November.\nThe research was supported with funds from the National Action Plan for Salinity via the Centre for Natural Resource Management, and the River Murray Levy.",

    "description": "Sites where Black-Cockatoos (generally Carnaby’s) are confirmed to be breeding. Breeding is inferred based on surveys which have recorded either birds entering/leaving the nest or the inside of the nest has been viewed with eggs or chicks. These records are of breeding attempts, but not necessarily of successful fledging. The first surveys were in 2003, with some nests surveyed a single time and others revisited once a year. Most records are in the peak breeding season of Carnaby’s (September to January). Breeding sites are buffered to 2 Kilometres.",

A single Australian World Heritage Areas database has been created by combining data which was historically stored as a separate set of data for each property. World Heritage Area buffer zones are also included in this dataset for relevant properties.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, the Tasmanian Wilderness, the Wet Tropics of Queensland and Shark Bay meet all four World Heritage criteria for natural heritage, with Kakadu National Park, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Willandra Lakes Region and the Tasmanian Wilderness being listed for both natural and cultural criteria. The 2010, 2012 and 2013 extensions to the Tasmanian Wilderness have been incorporated. The Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Naracoorte/Riversleigh), Lord Howe Island Group, Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, Fraser Island, Macquarie Island, Heard and McDonald Islands, the Greater Blue Mountains Area and Purnululu National Park are listed under the World Heritage criteria for natural heritage. The Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens, Melbourne were inscribed in the World Heritage List against Cultural criterion (ii): exhibit an important interchange of human values over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town planning or landscape design. The Sydney Opera House was inscribed in the World Heritage List in 2007 against Cultural criterion (i) (see http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria ) The Australian Convict Sites was inscribed on the World Heritage List on 31 July 2010. There are 11 sites that make up the World Heritage Australian Convict Sites against Cultural criterion (iv) and (vi). The Ningaloo Coast was inscribed on the World Heritage List in June 2011 against Natural criteria (vii) and (x). \nThe coastline of Queensland was produced under specific contract for Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) by AUSLIG in 1984. Originally engineered by AUSLIG from datasets produced by the Division of National Mapping and RAN Hydrographic Service; Queensland coastal information produced by AUSLIG at 250k scale with 100k elements from developing technology at the time of genesis; Island information is specific to the Great Barrier Reef Region as produced from RAN Hydrographic Service data at 100k scale. Updated against satellite imagery during the RAP process (2003-2004) to 25k scale, especially in Cairns, Whitsundays and Hinchinbrook Regions. This coastline is used to represent the coastal boundary of the Great Barrier Reef WHA, and is supplied by GBRMPA Spatial Data Centre.",

    "description": "    \n\nAusgrid is providing the following data on electricity consumption within our\nnetwork area for the 2009/2010 financial year to be used in developing\napplications. The data is from customer billing data and grouped by local\ngovernment areas (LGA) in Ausgridas network.\n\nAverage electricity consumption by geographic area can vary significantly due\nto a number of factors. These include differences in climate, the use of\nnatural gas, the type of housing (house or apartment), type of business\n(commercial or industrial), and varying household socio-demographics or\nbusiness types.\n\nThese figures also do not necessarily include the electricity used in common\nareas of apartments like halls, garages or pools. About 20% of energy in an\napartment building is typically used in these sorts of areas.\n\nThis data does not include high voltage customers and supply to services such\nas public lighting and bus shelters.\n\nFor help in interpreting the data, please contact\n[sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au](mailto:sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au).\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

Resident and tourist views about the relative ¿value¿ of key ecosystem services that are provided by the reef. Researchers will design, distribute and analyse the results of a survey instrument to assess the relative value of different goods and services produced by the GBR to stakeholder groups using both traditional money-based valuation techniques and Larson¿s non-monetary based technique. \n\n2. Tourist views about the relative value of key attributes of reef health, and the likely consequence if reef health deteriorates such as fewer visits and less expenditure. \n\n3. Researchers will develop  proxies for rainfall, water quality, land use and economy at the catchment scale. Analyses of these data will be used to determine the extent to which variations in beef prices, the exchange rate and other socio-economic variables (in conjunction with biophysical variables) influence water quality in the GBR lagoon.",

These government preschool classes provide full-time or part-time schooling at pre-primary level.\n\n\nIn NSW, most children receiving a preschool education or early intervention are enrolled at a government funded community preschool or in centre-based service which offers a preschool program.\n\n\nChildren aged 3 to 6 years may be enrolled in a preschool program, although programs are typically delivered to 4 and 5 year olds, on the basis that they will be starting school the following year.\n\n\nFrom 2022 data that shows less than 10 students is included in the next age category for privacy reasons\n\n\nData source\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

    "description": "Upper Lachlan Shire Council (Council) commissioned the Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan for the villages of Crookwell, Gunning, Collector and Taralga. The overall objectives of the Floodplain Risk Management Study (FRMS) were to assess the impacts of flooding, review existing Council policies as they relate to development of land in flood liable areas, consider options for the management of flood affected land and to develop a draft Floodplain Risk Management Plan (FRMP) which:\ni) Proposes modifications to existing Council policies to ensure that the development of flood affected land is undertaken so as to be compatible with the flood hazard and risk.\nii) Proposes Flood Planning Levels for the various land uses in the floodplain.\niii) Sets out the recommended program of works and measures aimed at reducing over time, the social, environmental and economic impacts of flooding.\niv) Provides a program for implementation of the proposed works and measures. \nThe FRMS focusses on Main Stream Flooding (MSF) from the Crookwell River and Kiamma Creek at Crookwell, Meadow Creek at Gunning, Collector Creek at Collector and Corroboree Creek at Taralga; Minor Tributary Flooding (MTF) caused by high flows in the minor un-named tributaries which drain to the aforementioned watercourses, and Major Overland Flow (MOF) areas which occur in the developed parts of the four villages.1 Flooding problems on the MOF paths arise from surcharges of the trunk drainage systems, which comprise a mix of natural depressions, pipes, culverts and open drains.\nThe solutions of problems resulting from surcharges of minor drainage lines in streets or in individual allotments remote from the MOF paths are matters for stormwater management by Council and are outside the scope of the present investigation.",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘Perched_aquifer_fresh.shp’ contains polygon data indicating the approximate boundary of the freshwater perched aquifer on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behavior on the island.  The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the freshwater perched aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA4. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA4 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates.

The previous “school classification” is no longer applicable.\n\n\nPrimary schools enrol students in Kindergarten to Year 6. \n\n\nSecondary schools generally enrol students in Years 7 to 12, although some secondary schools only enrol students in the senior years, i.e. Years 11 to 12 or the junior years, i.e. Years 7 to 10 (NSW School of Languages, Aurora College and Centre of Excellence in Agricultural Education are included in the ‘Other’ category under Secondary Schools. These schools do not have census enrolments.) . \n\n\nCentral/community schools have primary and secondary departments and may be established where there is an enrolment in secondary classes of 20 or more. Enrolments in primary departments and secondary departments are included with the appropriate student data.\n\n\nSchools for specific purposes (SSPs) are for students with specific needs. Most SSPs have permanent enrolments and include schools for students with intellectual (mild, moderate and severe) and physical disabilities, visual or hearing impairment, behaviour disorders or emotional disturbance, and students in juvenile justice centres. Some SSPs have no permanent enrolments because the children temporarily attending them are enrolled and counted in their own schools. These are mainly hospital schools.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin. Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the high rainfall zone grazing system model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "title": "Interpreted bedrock geology 1:100 000 (DMIRS-038)",
    "description": "The digital ‘1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia’ comprises three layers: the primary 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology lines , and the 1:100 000 State linear structure layer. The product covers approximately 30% of Western Australia, with a focus on areas of exposed Archean and Proterozoic bedrock. The linear structure layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic bedrock structures. This compilation is based on Geological Survey of Western Australia’s (GSWA) published Geological Information Series (GIS) and Geological Exploration Packages (GEP) for which digital 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 interpreted bedrock geology is available. The data packages included are: Kimberley 2017, Tanami–Arunta 2016, West Musgrave 2017, East Albany–Fraser Orogen 2014 (1:250 000 pre-Mesozoic), West Capricorn 2016, East Yilgarn 2017, South Yilgarn 2016, Murchison 2017, and Pilbara 2014. Geological interpretation in these packages is based on extensive fieldwork and interpretation of geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and previously published and unpublished geological mapping. With the exception of minor topological corrections, the spatial integrity of the source packages is maintained. For adjacent but separately compiled packages, seamless interpretation along the edges of project areas has not been executed in order to preserve the spatial integrity of the source information. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the lithostratigraphic units in the polygon and line layers are based on weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships, and include more recent geochronology. The source package of each feature is captured as an additional attribute field. Individual packages are available via the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety’s (DMIRS) eBookshop. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of closed treatment episodes by treatment delivery setting. A treatment episode is the period of contact between a client and a treatment provider where there are defined start (commencement) and end (cessation) dates. It is considered closed where any of the following occurs: treatment is completed or has ceased; there has been no contact between the client and treatment provider for 3 months; or there is a change in the main treatment type, principal drug of concern or delivery setting.\nThe alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the closed treatment episode was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment episodes are excluded from the AODTS NMDS if they: are not closed in the relevant financial year; are for clients who are receiving pharmacotherapy and not receiving any other form of treatment that falls within the scope of the collection; include only activities relating to needle and syringe exchange; or are for a client aged under 10 years.\n\n\nTreatment delivery settings is the main physical setting in which the type of treatment that is the principal focus of a client's alcohol and other drug treatment episode is actually delivered to a client (irrespective of whether or not this is the same as the usual location of the service provider).\n\n",

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nThis dataset comprises polygons that identify existing residential developments in a defined floodway where building controls are recommended on house extensions, redevelopment and fencing.\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFitzroy River – Fitzroy Crossing Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMurray River/Peel Inlet - Ballee, Yunderup and Cooleenup Islands, Culleenup Road and Pericho Close.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as FPM Special Development Condition Area (DOW-039)",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "Vectorized version of the Land Monitor Salinity Extent – South West of Western Australia 1990 dataset.\n\nSalinity mapped in raster format with 25-m pixels. The Land Monitor salinity mapping process uses satellite imagery, high-resolution topographic data, ground information and ancillary GIS data sets to map areas of severely salt-affected land identified in consecutive satellite (Landsat TM) scenes (Furby et al 2010). To update the 1990 and 1998 estimates, the spatial-temporal methodology was re-applied using the same approach but took advantage of the latest data and improved computational resources (Caccetta et al 2022). Any changes in the extent of salt affected land detected by Land Monitor in the updated salinity mapping are most likely within the severe salinity class and may represent either expansions of this class of salinity or improvements in the condition of severely salt affected land or in the reduction of commission errors (compared to the original mapping).\n\nThis data has converted the salt effected areas to a vector geodatabase. Additional post processing to remove urban areas has been applied.",

For the offshore component, the map uses data and divisions from the Geoscience Australia ‘Australian Geological Provinces’ GIS dataset, with polygons adjusted to match seamlessly into the onshore tectonic elements. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the tectonic units are based on weekly updates from the GSWA Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-todate geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded units, display correct tectonic relationships and include more recent geochronology. This digital layer is designed to outline\ntectonic units at the highest levels within the tectonic hierarchy; that is, to delineate the areal extent of cratons, orogens, and basins.",

    "description": "The Local Government Performance Reporting Framework (LGPRF) is a mandatory system of performance reporting for all Victorian councils. It ensures that councils are measuring and reporting on their performance in a consistent way to promote transparency and accountability in the local government sector.\n\nThe framework is made up of 59 measures from a range of service areas, including roads, planning, animal management and waste. It is complemented by a Governance and Management checklist of 27 items, which shows the policies, plans and procedures in place at each council. Together, they build a comprehensive picture of council performance.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/know-your-council\">Know Your Council website</a> allows you to find your council and view profile details about each local government in Victoria.\n\nKnow Your Council and the LGPRF have been developed by Local Government Victoria (LGV) within the Department of Government Services (DGS). Mandatory performance reporting became a requirement for local government from the 2014-15 local government annual budgeting and reporting cycle onwards. \n\nWhen reviewing and analysing the full data set, it is important to acknowledge that:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nthe data in this data set may change as councils occasionally need to update their performance data ahead of their next Annual Report\n</li>\n<li>\n\nthe Variation commentary provided alongside the data should always be considered with any analysis or reporting of a council's data\n</li>\n<li>\n\nvariables in the data may not allow for accurate comparisons\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nAs such, in downloading this data, you have agreed not to use the council performance data set to aid in the publication of overly simplistic league tables of councils. \n\nDue to file size limitations LGV can only provide the 5 years of historical data. For further information please contact the team at: <a href=\"mailto:performance@ecodev.vic.gov.au\">performance@ecodev.vic.gov.au</a>",
