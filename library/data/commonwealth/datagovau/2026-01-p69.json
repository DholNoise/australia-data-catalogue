    "description": "This web service contains sediment and geochemistry information for the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in the Timor Sea collected by Geoscience Australia during September and October 2012 on RV Solander (survey GA0339/SOL5650).  Further information on the survey is available in the post-survey report published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L., Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A.\nSurvey SOL5650/GA0339 was undertaken between 12 September and 6 October 2012, using the AIMS 35 m research vessel Solander with a science and technical support crew from AIMS, Geoscience Australia, University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. The survey comprised a series of geophysical mapping and biophysical sampling activities in four areas within the Oceanic Shoals CMR. In each survey area, multibeam sonar data (bathymetry and backscatter) was collected to provide 100% spatial coverage, with sampling stations selected before the survey. Site selection used a spatially-balanced random stratified method (termed a Generalised Random-Tessellation Stratified [GRTS] design), that was weighted to shallow areas (<50 m water depth). Sampling included non-destructive techniques (towed underwater video, stills photography, baited underwater video) to record benthic and pelagic biota, plus physical sampling of sediments and epibenthic biota (grabs, benthic sled tows). Water column measurements (conductivity, temperature, turbidity) and sea surface samples were also taken at representative stations and during transits. To broadly characterise the sub-surface geology, shallow (<70 m) sub-surface data was collected across three of the survey areas with a sub-bottom profiler.\nSampling was undertaken at 70 stations across the four survey areas to characterise the geophysical and biological properties of the seabed and water column within each area; with sea surface samples collected at a further nine stations during transits. At each station, the type of sampling undertaken and the gear used was determined by the seabed composition, water depth and visibility. In particular, deployment of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) was limited to water depths less than ~60 m due to high turbidity and low light conditions. \nSampling activities within the four survey areas included:\nTowed underwater video transects at 52 stations to characterise seabed types and benthic communities;\nCollection of replicate sediment samples at 61 stations for sedimentology, geochemistry and infauna analyses using either a Smith-McIntyre grab (29 stations) or a box corer (32 stations);\nBenthic sled tows at 22 stations to sample epibenthos;\nDeployment of BRUVS at 56 stations to characterise demersal fish communities;\nDeployment of Stereo Imagery System for Shark and Tuna Assessments (SISSTAs) units at 120 stations to characterise pelagic fish communities;\nDeployment of a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) instrument at 63 stations to characterise water column properties, and; \nDeployment of 10 ocean drifters to map surface ocean currents in the region.\nA link to the post-survey report is available here: http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/76658/Rec2013_038.pdf\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

A building footprint is a 2D polygon (or multi-polygon) representation of the base of a building or structure. The footprint is defined as the boundary of the structure where the walls intersect with the ground plane or podium, rather than an outline of the roof area (roofprint).\n\nWhere a building has a significant change in built form, multiple footprint polygons are ‘stacked’ vertically to define shape of the built form. This includes, and is not limited to:\n\n- Tower\n- Podium\n- Setbacks/offsets\n\nThe Australian Height Datum (AHD) is the national vertical datum for Australia. The National Mapping Council adopted the AHD in May 1971 as the datum to which all vertical control mapping would be referred\n\nThe data was captured in May 2023.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory.

This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions.

    "description": "The Cashless Debit Card (CDC) program has ended in all locations across Australia, and all CDC participants have now exited the program or transferred to enhanced Income Management. Data summaries for the CDC program by month include the below tables:\r\n\r\nTable 1. Number of CDC participants by original CDC location, Income Support Payment and if a participant had identified as an Indigenous Australian.\r\n\r\nTable 2. Community panel (or body) decisions to change the restricted portion of welfare payment.\r\n\r\nTable 3. When someone was not subject to cashless welfare arrangements: Well-being exemptions.\r\n\r\nTable 4. When someone was not subject to cashless welfare arrangements: Exits.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about the CDC:\r\n\r\nOn 6 March 2023, CDC participants located in the Northern Territory, Cape York and Doomadgee region, as well as volunteers from the Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions, moved to enhanced Income Management. More information about enhanced Income Management is located on the Department of Social Services (the department) web site: https://www.dss.gov.au/families-and-children/programmes-services/welfare-conditionality/enhanced-income-management-overview \r\n\r\nThe CDC program was repealed on 30 March 2023, by the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Act 2022, which is located here: https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2022A00039.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocations and commencement dates:\r\n\r\nLocation: Ceduna region, South Australia \r\n\r\nCommencement date: 15 March 2016\r\n\r\nIncluded: Ceduna, Koonibba, Scotdesco, Yalata and Oak Valley \r\n\r\nCohort: All people on a working age income support payment\r\n\r\nLocation: East Kimberley region, Western Australia\r\n\r\nCommencement date: 26 April 2016\r\n\r\nIncluded: Kununurra and Wyndham \r\n\r\nCohort: All people on a working age income support payment\r\n\r\nLocation: Goldfields region, Western Australia \r\n\r\nCommencement date: 26 March 2018\r\n\r\nIncluded: Kalgoorlie, Boulder, Coolgardie, Laverton, Leinster, Leonora, Menzies and Kookynie.\r\n\r\nCohort: All people on a working age income support payment\r\n\r\nLocation: Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region, Queensland\r\n\r\nCommencement date: 21 September 2018\r\n\r\nIncluded: Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Aldershot, Bargara, Elliott Heads, Woodgate, Booyal, Burrum Heads, Torbanlea, Toogoom, Howard, Childers, Burnett Heads and River Heads.\r\n\r\nCohort: All people aged 35 years and under who received Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance (Job seeker), Parenting Payment (Single) or Parenting Payment (Partnered).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Confidentialisation Policy: Table cells are suppressed where the count refers to less than five, but more than zero, people.\r\n\r\nThe method is:\r\n\r\n•\tCells with counts between one (1) and four (4) are presented as <5.\r\n\r\n•\tCells with a count of zero (0) are not suppressed.\r\n\r\n•\tWhere suppression has been applied and it is still possible to derive the cell value from other information in the table, the total/s or the next lowest aggregate cells are suppressed and presented with ‘n.p.’ (not provided).\r\n\r\n\r\nData caveats: If a person was on the CDC program and moved out of a CDC area, they remained on the program and were reported against their original CDC community.\r\n",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The physical climate defines a significant portion of the habitats in which biological communities and species reside. It is important to quantify these environmental conditions, and how they have changed, as this will inform future efforts to study many natural systems. We present the results of a statistical  summary of the variability in sea surface temperature (SST) time-series data for the waters surrounding Australia, from 1993 to 2013. We partition variation in the SST series into annual trends, inter-annual trends, and a number of components of random variation. We utilise satellite data and validate the statistical summary from these data to summaries of data from long-term monitoringstations and from the global drifter program. The spatially dense results show clear trends that associate with oceanographic features. Noteworthy oceanographic features include: average warming was greatest off southern West Australia and off eastern Tasmania where the warming was around 0.6 C per decade for a twenty year study period, and; insubstantial warming in areas dominated by the East Australian Current but this area did exhibit high levels of inter-annual variability (long-term trend increases and decreases but does not increase on average). The results of the analyses can be directly incorporated into (biogeographic) models that explain variation in biological data where both biological and environmental data are on a fine scale.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Queensland fruit fly model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\n The Calperum Chowilla site was established in July 2010 and is managed by the University of Adelaide, coordinated by Prof Wayne Meyer and Prof David Chittleborough of the Landscape Futures Program as part of the Environment Institute. This is a former sheep grazing property that has been destocked and is being managed as a conservation area in this type of ecosystem. The landscape is flat with a series of low east–west sand dunes. The dunes are remnants of a previous dry era and are mostly now stabilized by mallee (multi-stemmed Eucalypt trees) and various shrubs. It is a semi-arid environment fringing the River Murray floodplains of the Riverland. ",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

Exclusion areas contain known BRM resources but are considered unfavourable for excavation. These areas are likely to have protected environmental values or are excluded for planning or infrastructure reasons. Currently, this dataset only shows those Exclusion Areas that lie within the Perth and Peel Regions and that were identified by an extensive interagency BRM planning process, which included public consultation in 2015 and 2016.

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>cherry</strong> model in the Horticulture and Viticulture node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "Aggregated metadata on environmental monitoring and observing activities from three Australian national research infrastructures (NRIs): biodiversity survey events from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/), marine observations collected by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and site-based monitoring and survey efforts by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/). This dataset provides a summary breakdown of these efforts by survey topic, region and time period from 2010 to the present.\nSurvey topics are mapped to an EcoAssets Earth Science Features vocabulary based on the Earth Science keywords from the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD, https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/KeywordViewer/) vocabulary, modified to use taxonomic concept URIs from the Australian National Species List (ANSL, https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/) in place of the GCMD Earth Science &gt; Biological Classification vocabulary. ANSL categories map more readily to biodiversity survey categories, since GCMD depends on a top-level division between vertebrates and invertebrates rather than offering an animal category. The EcoAssets Earth Science Features vocabulary, including alternative keywords used in ALA, IMOS or TERN datasets, can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.26197/w2a2-6s86.\nTo find out more about this dataset visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/aggregated-data-environmental-monitoring-and-observations-effort/",

    "description": "This dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied and contains boundary and attribute information for parcels of public, private and Aboriginal lands in Australia. Data are sourced primarily from government gazette notices, cadastral maps and plans. A nominal scale of around 1:5 million and a minimum 50 square kilometre threshold limit for land parcels was used in the generalisation of this product from the National Public and Aboriginal Lands data. Data is suitable for GIS applications. This map shows public and private land tenure, including Indigenous land for the whole of Australia at a scale of 1:4.7 million.\nThe land tenure boundaries depicted on this map generally define broadly classified areas greater than 50 square kilometres. Indigenous land areas between 0.1 and 100 square kilometres are shown more comprehensively by symbols. The information on this map is complemented by statistical tables giving the total area of the land tenure categories for each State and Territory.\nThis map is also available as free vector GIS data, ArcInfo Export, ArcView Shapefile and MapInfo mid/mif. Please direct any corrections or feedback on this map to mapfeedback@ga.gov.au.\nProduct Specifications: Coverage: Australia Currency: Mid 1993 Coordinates: Geographical Datum: AGD66 Projection: Simple Conic on two standard parallels 18S and 36S Medium: Printed map (flat and folded).

    "description": "These data are derived from returns submitted by corporations registered as Category ‘Other’ under the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_. Category ‘Other’ includes corporations formerly registered as Category F (Finance Companies), G (General Financiers) and E (Pastoral Finance Companies) under the _Financial Corporations Act 1974_. Along with Category D (Money Market Corporations), these corporations are known collectively as Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs).\r\n\r\nIn April 2003, responsibility for the collection of financial statistics from Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) was transferred to APRA. Previously, these data were collected by the RBA under the now repealed Financial Corporations Act 1974. The introduction of new reporting forms in April 2003 has led to some significant breaks in series and affected definitions and categories shown for these institutions. There are other breaks from time to time in the historical data due to changes in the number of reporting corporations. Details of data reported by individual corporations are confidential.\r\n\r\nSince December 1999, the collections cover RFCs whose assets in Australia (including related corporations) exceed $50 million. Prior to December 1999, this threshold was set at $5 million. This change resulted in breaks in all series covering RFCs.\r\n\r\nThe collection of statistics from the authorised money market dealers (formerly Category C corporations under the Financial Corporations Act 1974) ceased from August 1996.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, the data are derived from RRF 320.0: Statement of Financial Position collected by APRA. Prior to April 2003, the data were derived from the FCA forms: D1, E1, F1 and G1 which were collected by the RBA.\r\n\r\n‘AFIs’ refers to banks, credit unions, building societies, SCCIs, RFCs and the RBA.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Cash and liquid assets – Cash and balances with AFIs’ includes cash and deposits and placements with AFIs. Prior to April 2003, this series includes cash and deposits and placements with banks and RFCs.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Cash and liquid assets – Other’ includes gold bullion and deposits and placements with clearing houses and other (non-AFI) financial institutions. Prior to April 2003, this series includes deposits and placements with all institutions other than banks and RFCs. This series also includes placements with authorised money market dealers prior to August 1996.\r\n\r\n‘Trading and investment securities – Debt’ includes commercial paper and promissory notes, bills of exchange and all other debt securities held by all counterparties.\r\n\r\n‘Loans and advances – Household’ includes housing and other personal loans to households, and excludes finance lease receivables.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Loans and advances – Business’ includes loans to the following counterparties: private trading corporations, private unincorporated businesses, public non-financial corporations, community service organisations and other (non-AFI) financial institutions. Prior to April 2003, this series includes loans to all counterparties other than households and RFCs, and also includes bills of exchange accepted by the reporting corporation. This series excludes finance lease receivables.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Loans and advances – AFIs’ includes loans to AFIs. Prior to April 2003, this series only includes loans to RFCs (loans to other AFIs are included in ‘Loans and advances – Business’). This series excludes finance lease receivables.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Borrowings from residents – Borrowings from AFIs’ includes deposits and placements due to AFIs and short-term loans from ADIs. Prior to April 2003, this series includes borrowings from banks and related RFCs.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Borrowings from residents – Deposits and placements’ includes deposits and placements due to the following counterparties: private trading corporations, private unincorporated businesses, public non-financial corporations, community service organisations and other (non-AFI) financial institutions.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2003, ‘Borrowings from residents – Other’ includes borrowings by the issue of promissory notes, bills of exchange and other debt securities, short-term loans from non-ADIs and all long-term loans. Prior to April 2003, this series includes borrowings from all counterparties other than banks and related RFCs, and borrowings by the issue of promissory notes, debentures, unsecured notes and bills of exchange accepted by banks.\r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

This study was initiated to address concerns regarding the effect of harvesting on crayfish stocks.\n\nThe survey results are taken from an unpublished interim report presenting the results of the work at that stage (1965).\nApparently an aerial survey was used to determine stock distributions although this is not specified in the report.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This data was collected in February 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R4.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart, Australia, February 19, 2013\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, February 25, 2013\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This study surveyed the size distribution of Lepsiella vinosa at 3 sites on the rocky shore at West Head, Victoria. Monthly or bi-monthly searchers were conducted from June 1975 to August 1978 during spring low tide. Every individual L.vinosa found at the 3 sites was measured to the nearest 0.01cm with vernier calipers. To determine recruitment of L.vinosa to the shore, individuals were arbitrarily designated as juveniles (< 0.8 cm) or adult (> 0.8 cm). The type of microhabitat where each individual was found was recorded at Sites 1 and 2 for the searchers conducted in spring (November 1977), summer (January 1978), autumn (April 1978), and winter (August 1978). \n\nThere were larger individuals of L.vinosa at higher intertidal levels (Site 1) compared to the mid- and lower sites (Sites 2 and 3). The recruitment of juveniles could not be determined from the size frequency distribution at any of the sites. There was more L.vinosa than expected in the rock pool habitats compared to the bare rock in all seasons except for winter at Site 2. There was high variability in abundance in the Lichinia habitat between all seasons and sites.",

The map is provided to inform the public of swooping bird \"hot spots\" so that they can prevent impacts from swooping birds, by avoiding areas temporarily. It is also useful for DEECA to gather intelligence on potential problem birds that may require management.

    "description": "MeerKAT has already discovered a number of Galactic transients, which are most likely to be Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs). Previous observations of a few of these sources with the Parkes UWL receiver have proven its utility in follow-up timing observations of MeerKAT discoveries.\n  MeerKAT has discovered a few more RRATs in its latest observing cycle and more good quality UWL observations of these sources are required to determine the rotational period and period derivative and also to facilitate the study of their emission properties. Therefore, we request follow-up observations of 5 new sources to achieve this and to further enable spectral and polarization studies of these sources. Given the potential link between RRATs, magnetars, and some fast radio bursts (FRBs) suggested by both observations and theories, this study could reveal more similarities between these different classes of transient sources and significantly advance our understanding of their origins.",

Because of Australia's relatively small population base and inadequate funding for at-sea science, maximum use of existing data had to be made to achieve a workable mapping. This motivated research into the use of datasets that were diverse in their methods, navigation, technologies, aims, standards,  formats - and whether numeric or linguistic. The research resulted in a data mining system designed especially for the seabed.\nThese web pages describe the digital GIS coverages that are now available for the seabed materials of the Australian maritime areas.",

The results also help us monitor our Council Plan and guide policy, planning and management to ensure that Melbourne continues to be a liveable, bold, inspirational and sustainable city.\nA visual representation of the indicators presented here can be found in our online visualisation. The indicators are from a select list we collect for the following two main activities: \n1. The City of Melbourne Social Indicator Survey (CoMSIS) provides insight into the health, wellbeing, participation and connection of residents in our city. This data is collected to directly address some of the Council Plan’s municipal outcome indicators and support our health and wellbeing priorities. Findings of the survey give insight into the perceived quality of life for our residents.\n2. The World Council on City Data (WCCD) is a network of cities committed to improving services and quality of life with open city data and standardised urban indicators. The WCCD developed and oversees an international standard for city data: ISO 37120 Sustainable Development of Communities: Indicators for City Services and Quality of Life. The City of Melbourne is a member of this network and annually submits indicators for verification in accordance with this standard.\nRelated datasets: Social Indicators for City of Melbourne Residents 2018",

    "description": "The growth history component (WAMSI Node 3.4.1) was to specifically characterise the morphology and growth history of the Ningaloo Reef system, to provide an insight into and predictive capacity for potential and future climatic changes.  \n\nReefs lining the western Exmouth Gulf, located at the northern limit of the 300 km long Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia, represent modern incipient coral reefs and veneers of non reef-building coral/algal communities on exposed Pleistocene or ‘give-up’ Holocene reef surfaces. \n\nAcquisition of sixteen cores alongside U-series TIMS dates were used to confirm the nature of the Pleistocene foundation and characterise Holocene reef development. Three calcretised Pleistocene units were identified as:\n1) the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e) reef directly underlying Holocene units, \n2) a mid-Pleistocene (MIS 7?) bioclastic conglomerate unit, and \n3) a Pleistocene alluvial fanglomerate. \n\nEight Holocene reef facies (total thickness of 1.8-5.3 m) included coral framework facies (domal, arborescent, mixed, tabulate and encrusting) and detrital facies (carbonate sand, skeletal rubble and alluvial fan deposits). Holocene ages range from 7.93-5.8 ka BP with vertical accretion ranging from 1.46-9.88 mm/yr (avg. 4.11 mm/yr). Highest rates of accretion and thickest accumulation occurred in the most seaward and deepest cores composed of massive coral framestone and coralline algal crusts. \n\nA six stage Holocene chronology is proposed, including: \n1) coastal inundation from 8-8.5 ka BP, \n2) initiation ‘start-up’ from 8-7.5 ka BP, \n3) rapid growth ‘catch-up’ and back-step from 7.5-7 ka BP, \n4) rapid aggradational growth ‘catch-up’ from 7-6.5 ka BP, \n5) reef decline ‘give-up’ and detrital buildup from 6.5-5.8 ka BP, and \n6) detrital buildup and progradation from 5.8 ka BP to present. \n\nChanges in reef facies and the ultimate demise of the Holocene reef probably involved a combination of increased sea-level, coastal flooding and erosion during the mid-Holocene highstand, with associated increase in sedimentation, turbidity and decline in water quality; burial by sediment buildup during the mid-Holocene highstand and detrital progradation during the mid- to late-Holocene regression; and, the introduction of alluvial sediment during cyclones and other severe storms to an already stressed community. Modern communities have thus shifted from coral-dominated to bored macroalgal pavements. \n\nThis study shows that integration of reef development processes with response to environmental change can be used to assess future pressures on coral reef ecosystems globally.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2016, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (DCM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "<b>Version Oct 2021</b>\nThe Strategic Framework Place Types is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.Planning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate).  For more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of helpful information sheets or contact Council.  The attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Further details on the Qld Planning Provisions can be found <a href=\"https://dilgpprd.blob.core.windows.net/general/qpp-4-0.pdf\">here</a>.",

The introduction of new reporting forms in\nApril 2003 has led to some significant breaks in series and affected\ndefinitions and categories shown for these institutions.

RFMPs for 2019–24 will be prepared during the life of the SBMP.\nThe ACT Emergency Services Commissioner (the Commissioner) is responsible for approval of RFMPs. They will be reviewed as required to reflect significant changes. These may include unplanned bushfires, which may provide strategic advantages or changes to the location or extent of assets – for example, the development of new estates.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nThe ACT Government is providing this bushfire management map for information purposes only.

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in November 2015, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (DCM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the synthetically modeled indicators relating to the financials of the population of small regions of Australia based on the 2016 Census and aggregated following the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The synthetic indicators are produced by the spatial micro-simulation model (SpatialMSM). The data has been provided by The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).\nNATSEM’s spatial microsimulation model uses a technique that takes a survey and reweights it to small area Census data. SpatialMSM18 is the application of the NATSEM Spatial Microsimulation model using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) dataset, the ABS Housing Expenditure Survey (for financial stress) and the 2016 Census of Population and Housing at the SA2 level (Tanton et al. 2011). All the indicators from the SpatialMSM model are synthetic, so there is some model error as well as other error from the survey. Therefore, they are not as accurate as the Census data used.\nData in this dataset comes from NATSEM's spatial microsimulation model. Estimates are for financial stress, trust and life satisfaction. A description of the model, and validation, can be found in the accompanying NATSEM Technical Report.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data provided directly from NATSEM.\n\n\nWhere data values are NULL, the data is either unpublished or not applicable mathematically.\n\n\nThe treatment of Not Stated and Overseas Visitor data is to exclude them from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n\nMethodology between the 2016 NATSEM and 2011 OECD data release may have changed, please refer to the technical report for parity status and specific changes.\n\n",

    "description": "Evaluation of native fish diversity, condition, reproduction and recruitment contribute to understanding the benefit of environmental water and to the biodiversity outcomes sought by the Basin Plan. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project examined the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and assisted the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nFish data was collected over the duration of the LTIM Project from 2014-15 to 2018-19 in all Selected Areas*, including: fish catch, individual length and weight, egg and larval catch, and estimated age of a small subset of individuals. \r\n\r\n*Due to the use of different methods to collect data in the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers Selected Area, this data has been excluded from the Basin scale analysis (however fish general outcomes are reported). \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Fish Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin.

    "description": "The Rottnest Shelf (ROT) HF ocean radar system covers an area which includes Rottnest Island and the Perth Canyon to the north-west.  The Perth Canyon has the highest marine biodiversity in the region with whale and fish aggregations, and high primary and secondary productions which are controlled by the physical oceanographic processes.  \n\nCombined with the dynamics of the Perth Canyon is the dominant Leeuwin Current which produces a wake on the leeward side of Rottnest Island.   This is a topographically induced up-welling and associated primary and secondary productivity.  The region is influenced by Swan River outflow, submarine groundwater discharges , and waste-water outfalls.  \n\nThe ROT HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Fremantle (32.031 S, 115.746 E) and Guilderton (31.342 S, 115.489 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe ROT area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Turqoise Coast (TURQ) SeaSonde HF ocean radar system on its north side.  Together, the ROT and TURQ systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle to Jurien Bay.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the total number of distinct specialist homeless services clients. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

    "description": "The Property Location Service Plus- Public version (PLSplus-Public) is available to anyone and used to validate Queensland addresses and property descriptions. The service can also supply location data from a geocode. The service does not offer interstate (non Queensland) address validation information. The service is free of charge and requires authentication. The service versions available are Soap and REST. To use the PLSplus-Public soap service an application utilising a file called a \"WSDL\" (Web Service Description Language) is required. The WSDL is an XML-based language that is used for describing the functionality offered by a web service.The WSDL description provides a machine-readable description of how the service can be called, what parameters it expects, and what data structures it returns. The wsdl is available (with service guidelines) at the online resources link of this record. The wsdl contains the required endpoint for the service. PLSplus-Public now requires authentication to use it but the wsdl can be viewed at https://information.qld.gov.au/service/Addressing/ValidationService/PLSplusPublic/soap?wsdl\nREST uri's and json examples for each function are available in the online resources zip file.\nSupport is only available to authenticated users. Instructions to apply for username and password are contained in the Information document found at the online resources link.PLSplus-Public provides the following operations:- ValidateAddress- ValidateLotPlan- ValidateCoordinates- ParseAddress and AutoCompleteAddressA successful validation of any of the first four operations (for Queensland locations) will also return other information, such as address, lot on plan, coordinates, address type and a matching confidence level for each request.The ValidateAddress operation validates the existence of a requested address. The address elements are in a rigid structure based around Australian Addressing Standards. If an identical address is found it returns all information about the address with a matching confidence. If no exact match is found it returns possible candidate addresses (up to 500) that best match the search criteria. A global confidence is given for all candidates. The requested elements of the address is parsed by the application.The ValidateAddress operation also geocodes the address and returns the geocoded coordinates.- The only field that is mandatory in the request is the street name or property name- Street Name can consist of a \"street name\" or \"street name\" and \"street type\",or \"street name\" and \"street type\" and \"street suffix\".- McCaul- McCaul Street- McCaul Street NorthThe ValidateLotPlan operation validates the existence of a Queensland \"Lot on Plan\" description and also returns the addresses and geocodes (if the parcel has them) for valid parcels. The requested Lot on Plan elements must be in a rigid structure to be parsed by the application. It should be noted that not all valid property descriptions have addresses and some parcels may have multiple addresses.The ValidateCoordinates operation provides a service to validate entered Latitude/Longitude coordinates within Queensland and return the closest addresses for the requested location. Search logic begins with a radius of of up to 250 metres. If no result is found the service locates the parcel or the coordinates and returns all addresses on that parcel. The coordinates elements is a rigid structure to be parsed by the application. Coordinates (in Degree.Decmial format ) with search box limited to - North Latitude: -9.0 West Longitude: 138.0- South Latitude: -29.5 East Longitude:155.0 - Coordinates will always be a negative Latitude and a positive Longitude.The AutoCompleteAddress operation returns up to 50 valid addresses based on the input of a text string. The longer the string typed the shorter the list of candidate addresses. Any address from returned candidates can be used as input to ParseAddress operation to return further information about the address. The ParseAddress operation provides a service to parse (into address components) and validate any single line Queensland address and return any associated addresses, lot on plans, geocode and confidence for a requested address. eg.

    "description": "This data was collected in May/June 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V02.\n\nDeparted: \tBrisbane, QLD, May 13, 2011\nArrived:   \tAuckland, NZ,    Jun 04, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The digital '1:2 500 000 geological map of Western Australia' comprises four layers: the primary 1:2 500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:2 500 000 State Cenozoic geology, the 1:2 500 000 State interpreted dyke suites, and the 1:2 500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology structural lines. The 1:2 500 000 interpreted geology contains geoscience data covering themes such as geology and tectonic boundaries that have been digitally rolled up from 1:500 000 data sources for optimal display at 1:2 500 000 scale. The Cenozoic geology layer can be superimposed over the bedrock layer to allow the extension of older bedrock geology under Cenozoic cover where geological and geophysical information permits, and to depict Cenozoic paleovalleys and additional significant Cenozoic cover. The dyke suites layer is primarily interpreted from aeromagnetic data, using mapped dyke extents as a guide. Individual dykes are assigned to named dyke suites wherever possible. The attribution of linear structures and dykes as concealed or exposed takes into account both the interpreted bedrock and the Cenozoic geology layers and does not reflect regolith cover. Detailed fault attribution has been simplified from the 1:500 000 scale, except in the case of major fault systems or tectonic boundaries. The nomenclature and hierarchy of lithostratigraphic units is based on the GSWA weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships and include more recent geochronology. Stratigraphic units are mostly displayed at greater than or equal to Group or Suite level; Subgroups and Formations are only displayed where areal extent warrants it and the unit does not have a higher order parent.",

    "description": "Wetland drainage and flood mitigation works have had a profound influence on hydrology, especially hydroperiod and tidal exchange across coastal NSW. \nBarriers or instream artificial tidal impediments that may limit blue carbon opportunities were selected from the NSW Government Fish Passage Dataset. This dataset indicates the location of in stream structures or barriers that may influence tidal exchange across NSW. This dataset was provided by the Department of Primary Industries: Fisheries. Some manipulation of data was necessary due to geospatial errors in the position of some tidal barriers. A 1 km buffer was identified at each tidal limit, and barriers within this buffer were considered to serve as a tidal impediment. Expert opinion from NSW Government Department of Primary Industries Fisheries officers verified the position of tidal barriers and their effectiveness as a tidal impediment.",

    "description": "The World Council on City Data (WCCD) awarded the City of Melbourne a platinum designation for its compliance with ISO 37120 (http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62436), the world’s first international standard for city indicators. Reporting to the standard allows cities to compare their service delivery and quality of life to other cities globally. The City of Melbourne was one on 20 cities to, globally to help pilot this program and is one of sixteen cities to receive the highest level of accreditation (platinum). \n\nHaving an international standard methodology to measure city performance allows the City of Melbourne to share data about practices in service delivery, learn from other global cities, rank its results relative to those cities, and address common challenges through more informed decision making. \n\nIndicators include: Fire and emergency response; Governance; Health; Recreation; Safety; Shelter; Solid Waste; Telecommunications and Innovation; Transportation; Urban Planning; Wastewater; Water and Sanitation; Economy; Education; Energy; Environment; and Finance.\n\nCity of Melbourne also submitted an application for accreditation, on behalf of ‘Greater Melbourne’, to the World Council on City Data and this resulted in an ‘Aspirational’ accreditation awarded to wider Melbourne. \n\nA summary of Melbourne's results is available here (http://open.dataforcities.org/). Visit the World Council on City Data’s Open Data Portal to compare our results to other cities from around the world.",

The hydrologic\nmodel combines rainfall information with local catchment characteristics to\nestimate runoff hydrographs.\n• A hydraulic model to convert runoff hydrographs into water levels and velocities\nthroughout the study area. The model simulates the hydraulic behaviour of the\nwater within the study area by accounting for flow in the major channels as well\nas all the potential overland flowpaths, which develop when the capacity of the\nchannels is exceeded. It relies on boundary conditions, which include the runoff\nhydrographs produced by the hydrologic model and the appropriate downstream\nboundary level from Lake Macquarie.",

The indicators include: Remoteness from Settlement, Remoteness from Access, Apparent Naturalness and Biophysical Naturalness, and were derived from the definition of Wilderness Quality as the extent to which a location is remote from and undisturbed by the influence of modern development.\n\nThe NWI database consists of all measurements used to derive wilderness indicator values, the wilderness indicator values themselves, and a final Wilderness Quality index.\n\nThis is an archived dataset owned by the Commonwealth Government under the NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Data Agreement of 31 March 2000.This data is available to the public from the Department and may be used by third parties for unrestricted use provided that the copyright interests of the owners are protected.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "This layer is the result of a wilderness mapping project that was undertaken by the Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS) in 2015. The scope of the project was the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA) and some adjoining areas considered to be of high conservation area.\n\nThe project driver was to encapsulate the level of wilderness quality of additional areas added to the TWWHA in 2013. A rerun of the previous 2005 assessment, for the TWWHA (at the 1999 boundary) allowed the project to see what changes in wilderness quality had occurred between 2005 and 2015 for existing areas of the TWWHA.\n\nThe methodology utilized was the same as the wilderness quality study of 2005, see metadata on WHA Wilderness Quality 2005 (PWS), which was also based on the Commonwealth NWI (below).\n\nThe methodology followed the guidelines of the National Wilderness Inventory (NWI) which was developed by the Australian Heritage Commission in the late 1980s and early 1990s to identify wilderness quality across Australia. The methodology is described in detail in the NWI Handbook of Procedures, Content and Usage (Lesslie and Taylor 1995). See hyperlink below for notes on the NWI from the Australian Heritage Commission website.\n\nThe objective of the first phase of the project (Module 1) was to use the existing NWI methodology to assess wilderness values in the WHA and in specified adjacent areas, based on the latest available information on roads, walkers, huts and similar infrastructure.\n\nIn the second phase (Module 2), wilderness was to be assessed using revised criteria taking into account walkers' huts, tracks and time-remoteness. The assessment of viewfields has been postponed to a future study.\n\nThe business processes, input data, spatial analysis and results are described in the project methodology document, available in the hyperlink below.\n\nThe wilderness quality layer is a coverage that represents the level of naturalness and remoteness based on the proximity of physical intrusions and infrastructure. The study did not consider social aspects.\n\nView dataset:\nhttps://maps.thelist.tas.gov.au/listmap/app/list/map?bmlayer=3&amp;layers=2407\n\nProject methodology:\nhttps://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/public/TWWHA%20Wilderness%20Value%20Assessment%202015.pdf\n\nCommonwealth NWI methodology:\nhttp://www.environment.gov.au/node/20141",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Weekly Rail Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2019",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",
