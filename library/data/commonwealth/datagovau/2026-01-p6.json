    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. A landscape classification approach was used to determine how hydrological changes due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development may affect ecosystems at a landscape scale in the Cooper GBA region. Seven landscape classes have been identified for the Cooper GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nInputs into the landscape classification were based on existing classification schemes wherever possible and can be purely physical, biological or predictive.\r\nThe landscape classification developed for the Cooper GBA region is a harmonisation of the Queensland Land Zones (Wilson and Taylor, 2012) and South Australian Land Systems (Santos, 1997), reflecting the substantial areas of the Cooper Basin in both states. Consistent with the principles outlined above, it sought to use existing data sources and classifications, and to leverage the extensive effort already expended to develop highly relevant conceptual models at both landscape scale and wetland scale by the Queensland Government as part of its Wetlands Program (Department of Environment and Science (Qld), 2017).\r\nDetailed land zones (Qld) within the Cooper GBA region were supplied by the Queensland Government (Department of Environment and Science (Qld), 2018a) and assigned to corresponding landscape classes. Land systems in South Australia (Santos, 1997) were coarsely mapped in the 1990s; hence, landscape classes for the Cooper Basin within SA were refined from land systems based on land system mapping, detailed (1:100 000) surface geology (Department for Energy and Mining (SA), 2018), elevation (Geoscience Australia, 2008) and landscape position inferred from 30 m Landsat images.",

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the long running ABARES  Australian fisheries surveys report. The report presents results from ABARES' fishery surveys on financial returns to fishers and net economic returns from fisheries to the Australian community. The report includes a range of other economic indicators, including productivity analysis. \r\n\r\nThis report covers the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS), and the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector (GHTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with new results for financial years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - has decreased since 2008-09, from $267 000 to $205 000 in 2012-13. In the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector, it has fallen from $200 000 in 2008-09 to $15 000 in 2012-13. This indicator assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, and includes income from all sources. \r\n• Net economic return in the Commonwealth Trawl Sector has declined from $7.3 million in 2010-11 to an estimated $1.4 million in 2013-14. Net economic returns in the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector has declined from $7.2 million to an estimated -$4.4 million in 2013-14. \r\n• The decline in net economic returns in both sectors may suggest that the total allowable catch settings may be misaligned with the Harvest Strategy Policy target of achieving maximum economic yield from the fishery. \r\n",

    "description": "The 2015 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 11 May to 12 June 2015. Overall, 91,937 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 66%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n \r\nThree files are available for download. \r\n\r\n* 2015 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2015 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2015 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2015 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2015 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2015 APS employee census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2015 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2015 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTfnd L3S product for a single 72 hour period, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the NOAA AVHRR SSTskin observations, and 0 degC to the Metop and VIIRS SSTsubskin observations, after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (&lt;6 m/s by day and &lt;2 m/s at night). The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 72 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

    "title": "Habitat condition time-series for the Cooper region",
    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset represents a historic annual time-series of estimated habitat condition across the study region, from 2001 to 2018 inclusive. These spatial grids were developed by combining two spatial data products: (1) a new analytical approach called Compere, which contrasts the vegetation cover of each location with a set of environmentally similar locations across the region, for each year; (2) a temporally static spatial layer on the total length of all linear anthropogenic disturbances, in each 500 m grid cell across the study region. The resultant habitat condition spatial time-series is therefore intended to combine information on both localised (e.g. roads, seismic surveys) and dispersed (e.g grazing, fire)  influences on the habitat condition for biodiversity of each location, ranging continuously from '0' (completely degraded) to '1' (pristine).\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nTo derive a past-to-present time-series of habitat condition across the buffered study regions, we combined two spatial data products. The first set of spatial data come from a new analytical approach called Compere, which contrasts the vegetation cover of each location with a set of environmentally similar locations across the region. For the present purpose, we applied the Absolute Range Ratio (ARR) metric from Compere, which for each location at a time-point is the observed vegetation cover divided by the maximum vegetation cover across all the environmentally similar locations at that time-point. The ARR spatial layers were available for each year from 2001 to 2018 inclusive. To translate the ARR spatial layers to better represent a habitat condition metric (h_ARR), we rescaled the ARR values as: \r\nh_ARR=ARR+(k×((100-ARR)/100))\r\nwith the scalar k specifying the minimum habitat condition value set to 40 % for the present analysis.\r\n\r\nThe second spatial dataset used in deriving habitat condition for biodiversity was a spatial layer on the total length of all linear disturbances in each 500 m grid cell across the study regions. We converted this layer into a habitat condition metric (hL) by assuming complete habitat loss for a width of 10 m for all linear disturbances, then taking the inverse of the proportion of each grid cell area that was disturbed.\r\n\r\nThese two data sources on habitat condition provide complementary information. The h_ARR condition metric derived from the Compere analysis is useful in detecting the broadscale impacts of actions such as grazing and fire management across the region on habitat condition. In contrast, the hL condition metric derived from the spatial data on linear disturbances is useful in identifying known disturbances, such as roads, fence-lines and seismic survey lines. We therefore combined these two condition metrics, using a conservative approach of taking the minimum condition value from each of these metrics, for each grid cell:\r\nh=min(h_ARR,h_L )\r\nassuming a constant level of linear disturbance over the time period of the Compere analysis (2001-2018). This provided an historic annual time series of habitat condition across each study region.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.

Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment.aDesignated irrigation\nareasa indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\nThe precise meaning of the term adesignated irrigation areaa varies from\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\nsource material is highly variable and completedness of coverage is poor in\nsome regions.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\n__00211a01.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

The layers were created in the following way:\n\nThe Rolling Downs Group layer was extracted from the GABATLAS Rolling Downs Aquitard - thickness and extent.  \n\nThe Pilliga Sandstone layer in the GAB was extracted from the GABATLAS Cadna-owie-Hooray Aquifer and Equivalents - Thickness and Extent. The Pilliga Sandstone in the Oxley (Gunnedah) Basin was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model.\n\nThe Purlawaugh Formation and Garrawilla Volcanics layer in the GAB was calculated using Layer 10 Great Artesian Basin base of Jurassic-Cretaceous sequence surface (GABWRA) and Layer 05 Great Artesian Basin base of Hooray Sandstone and equivalents surface (GABWRA). The Purlawaugh Formation and Garrawilla Volcanics in the Oxley (Gunnedah) Basin was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model.\n\nThe Interburden 1 layer was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model and combined the source layers of the Deriah and Napperby Formation, the Digby Formation and the Black Jack group above the Hoskissons Coal layer (layers 7, 8 and 9 in Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Hoskissons Coal layer was extracted directly from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model (layer 10 in the Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Interburden 2 layer was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model and combined the source layers of the Black Jack Group below the Hoskissons coal and the Millie Group (Watermark and Porcupine formations) (layers 11 and 12 in Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Maules Creek Formation layer was extracted directly from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model (layer 13 in the Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) Namoi BA geological model.

The Census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development, and job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOverall, 127,436 APS employees responded to the Employee Census in 2023, a response rate of 80%.\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200MB in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n###Technical notes\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2023 APS Employee Census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2023 APS Employee Census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2023 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2023 APS Employee Census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2023 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2023 APS Employee Census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2023 APS Employee Census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\nA recommended short citation is: 2023 APS Employee Census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.\r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a25.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

This is a land use nomenclature and classification scheme for Australia, ordering land use in a systematic, logical and consistent way. The ALUM Classification has been developed in collaboration with national, state and territory agencies as part of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). \r\n\r\n This document updates Part 2 of the  Guidelines for land use mapping in Australia: principles, procedures and definitions, 4th Edition published by ABARES in 2011. It reflects current needs and experience in classifying land use of national, state and territory agency partners involved in ACLUMP. \r\n\r\n The ALUM Classification has a three-tiered hierarchical structure. Primary, secondary and tertiary classes are broadly structured by the potential degree of modification and the impact on a putative 'natural state' (essentially, a native land cover). The ALUM Classification version 8 includes fields to collect commodity and land management practice information. ",

    "description": "This project will act as an integrating focus within the rainforest theme to strategically target research gaps and thereby increase our understanding of the drivers of rainforest biodiversity. We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. \n\nThe project consists of four subprojects:\n\nA. Monitoring: Tasks include a microsensor network, standardised vertebrate surveys, habitat structure monitoring and data harvesting from other projects. \n\nA comprehensive review of regional literature followed by extensive stakeholder consultation identified long-term monitoring data as the most important knowledge gap in the region (Welbergen et al. 2011). This sub-project is aimed at maintaining and significantly improving a regional-scale, long-term environmental monitoring program that provides biodiversity and environmental data that has a demonstrated value to a wide range of users including the research community, regional/state/national management agencies and conservation policy development, and national / international bioinformatic infrastructure initiatives (e.g. ALA, TERN). Data collected and maintained here will provide the primary input for the other sub-projects described below with flow-on inputs to many of the other proposed projects across the rainforest node. These data will include but not be limited to:\n1. Regional microclimate sensor network at more than 30 sites established under MTSRF that are strategically placed across elevational and latitudinal gradients in the region.\no Replace and upgrade existing microclimate stations (now defunct/worn out)\no Establish standardised microclimate logging stations in new sites in gaps in environmental coverage, identified climatic refugia, peripheral habitat isolates and increased coverage of the rainforest edge habitats (e.g. wet sclerophyll). Data: temperature (air, soil, microhabitats), humidity, soil moisture, cloud interception.\n2. Standardised vertebrate surveys across all long-term sites (>30) including:\no  2-4 complete surveys per year for three years with 6 replicated sampling points within each site and including standardised surveys of: birds, reptiles, spotlighting (mammals and other nocturnal fauna) and microhylid frogs, with potential to add specific other groups dependent on student projects. \no These surveys follow well-established and extensively published methodologies within the CTBCC (e.g. Williams et al. Ecology 2010).  \n3. Habitat structure monitoring will be continued and improved at all monitoring sites both directly by this project and via site-based collaboration with other projects including rainforest dynamics project (Project 10 - Laurance) and plant genetics (Project 9 -Crayn). \n4. Link to Project 14: potential monitoring of vegetation structure and thermal properties using UAV technology to capture aerial photos, multispectral remote sensing, Lidar vegetation structure, thermal imagery of habitat and fauna, cyclone damage and canopy condition.\n5. Additional monitoring data will be harvested across the node for increased regional and taxonomic coverage and baseline data improvements via links and data exchange with Projects 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 25. \n\n\nB. Climate change vulnerability and adaptation: Includes the production of downscaled regional climate projections, projected changes in species distribution models, composite biodiversity maps, identification and mapping of climate refugia, predictive models of impacts on biodiversity including extreme events. \n\nClimate change is arguably the single largest threat to biodiversity in Australia and the unique biodiversity of the Wet Tropics rainforests is recognised as one of the most threatened ecosystems globally (IPCC 4th AR). This subproject will build on previous and existing research to provide cutting-edge predictions on climate change impacts, vulnerability assessment and adaptation options for rainforest biodiversity. We will link closely with the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Network to ensure that outputs, tools and approaches are distributed across this network for maximum national and regional benefit and outcomes.  Specific objectives and collaborative links include:\n1. Produce and make available downscaled regional climate projections using eight Global Climate Models across multiple (at least 3) emission scenarios at 10 year time steps from 1970-2080 for more than 50 bioclimatic variables;\n2. Projected changes, including uncertainty estimates, in species distribution models and composite biodiversity maps for the majority of rainforest vertebrates, 500+ species of invertebrates, major vegetation types and some key ecosystem processes (baseline data for these analyses were collected under MTSRF and ongoing projects within the CTBCC);\n3. Identify and map climatic refugia (extension of previous MTSRF work that mapped landscape-scale temperature refugia by Shoo et al. 2010a, 2010b). This analysis will expand previous work to include finer scale microhabitat refugia and also increase the generality of the analyses by examining moisture refugia and dry season drought events that have been shown to have significant impacts on biodiversity (Williams & Middleton 2008, Middleton & Williams in review). \n4. Produce predictive impact models on biodiversity that explicitely include a consideration of extreme events rather than just environmental means/averages. Project will link closely with the extreme climate events project (Project 16 ¿ Welbergen) to incorporate the impacts of changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and extent of extreme events, such as heat waves and droughts, as a major component of assessing relative vulnerability and adaptation actions; \n5. Project will closely collaborate with Project 15 (Phillips, Llewelyn) examining the potential for useful local adaptation to climate changeextremes in isolated populations. This link explores the potential to utilise existing adaptive potential as a means to increase species resilience to climate change.\n6. Other external links:\n¿ NCCARF Refugia project (National) -  proposed\n¿ NCCARF Terrestrial Biodiversity Research Network\n¿ Northern Biodiversity NERP Hub\n¿ AEDA Hub ¿ Restoration project and Future Fellowship (Wintle) examining demographic modelling and climate change.\n7. Incorporate IPCC 5th Assessment Report climate models and scenarios into all above analyses, once they become available.\n\nC. Synthesis, analysis and integration: Determinants of biodiversity: Includes mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and 200+ species of invertebrates, identify key monitoring locations, examining the relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure. \n\nAn understanding of the drivers of biodiversity in the region is crucial to predicting impacts from a variety of threats and ensuring effective conservation planning and management that aims to maintain a resilient landscape. We will use data collected in subproject A in combination with our existing extensive vertebrate and invertebrate database to examine the drivers of biodiversity in the region and to provide the resources and knowledge to make this useful to stakeholders. Specific objectives will include, but not be limited to: \n1. Mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and >500 species of invertebrates (distribution and abundance) with emphasis on threatened species;\n2. Identify key locations and taxa where we have long-term count data and/or high frequency of repeat count surveys over time periods that have encompassed important environmental change. We will undertake statistical power analyses to evaluate condition and trends of species (e.g., range shifts, change in population size);\n3. Analyses will also inform the design of our ongoing monitoring program (subproject A) to maximise the detection of change in a cost-effective manner. \n4. Comprehensive habitat/vegetation type vulnerability assessment;\n5. Examine a range of environmental and evolutionary drivers of biodiversity to provide the basic scientific underpinnings for evidence-based policy and management in the region including paleostability of habitat; seasonal habitat and climatic stability, relationships to ecosystem processes such as net primary productivity, habitat structure and heterogeneity, species and habitat compositional turnover and evolutionary biology.\n6. Examine relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure (vegetation type and structure, habitat extent, connectivity etc.)\n\nD. Status, trends and future projections: Includes Producing a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets.\n\nNo practical measure currently exists to evaluate trends in biodiversity values at the ¿whole-of-region¿ scale in near real-time on a regular, repeatable and affordable basis (WTMA Research Strategy 2010-2014). We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. This will be the major vehicle for synthesizing, integrating and communicating data from all projects. This project will make use of extensive computing power represented by the collaboration between the CTBCC and the James Cook University eResearch group and High Performance Computing Facility. Specific objectives:\n1. Produce and make publicly available a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets based on a user-defined spatial area that will return all predicted and observed data within the query area for climate (past, current and future projections), habitat, species (predicted and observed), biodiversity values, terrain, ecosystem processes and, where available data is site-based, the tool could query the temporal patterns in the data (e.g. changes in abundance of a species) with ¿approaching real-time¿ updates (expected bi-annual upload of all new biodiversity and environmental data with temporal resolution dependent on the specific data stream, example quarterly for the standardised vertebrate surveys).\n2. Automatic upload, synthesis and visualisation in JCU eResearch group (Tropical Data Hub) including time series examination of trends;\n3. Automated upload via Tropical Data Hub onto National (ALA, TERN, NPEI) and international (GBIF) data infrastructure. This means that as data is entered into our system from the monitoring program and other projects, it will be uploaded and available via national and international data portals;\n4. Future forecasting of trends and forecasts via combination of modelling and workshopping to conduct future horizon scanning.\n\nOnce established, these bioinformatic tools could form the basis for UNESCO, and Queensland and Australian government reporting on the state of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and could easily be utilized more generally across other ecosystems in Australia.",

It was developed from\r\nmultiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets\r\nrelated to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous\r\nland dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the\r\nForests of Australia (2018) dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies Indigenous land into four categories:\r\n*Indigenous owned and managed: freehold land that is both owned\r\nand managed by Indigenous communities\r\n*Indigenous managed: land that is managed, but not owned, by\r\nIndigenous communities; and lands that are owned by Indigenous\r\npeople but have formal shared management agreements with\r\nAustralia and state and territory government agencies\r\n*Indigenous co-managed: land that is owned and managed by other\r\nparties, but has a formal, legally binding agreement in place that\r\nincludes input from Indigenous people in the process of\r\ndeveloping and implementing a management plan\r\n*Other Special rights: land subject to native title determination,\r\nregistered Indigenous land use agreement, and legislated special\r\ncultural use provision.\r\n\r\nThe *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was derived by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the History field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis boundary was developed in consultation with the Northern Territory Government and is informed by the principles described in the draft Northern Territory Strategic Regional Environmental Bioregional Assessment Framework.   For terrestrial ecosystems these are:\r\n\r\nFor the ecology domains of the SREBA, the boundary should be determined following consideration of the following spatial areas: \r\n•\tbiogeographical boundaries \r\n•\tgeological (sub)basin boundaries with the gas resource\r\n•\tencompass the spatial distribution of ecological values on which gas development in that region could feasibly have an impact, including predictable indirect impacts; and\r\n•\tinclude sufficient bioregional extent to provide adequate context to assess the significance of any potential impact.   \r\nIn general, these boundaries should correspond to IBRA sub-bioregions.  However, additional consideration should be given to:\r\n•\twhere gas development can feasibly only occur in one part of a large region, sub-regional boundaries may be appropriate\r\n•\twhere only a small portion of a bioregion overlaps the edge of a gas (sub)basin, that entire bioregion cannot be cost-effectively be incorporated in the SREBA, so only a portion of that subregion should be included \r\n•\twhere there is potential for significant downstream impacts from development (notably on the quality or quantity of ground- or surface water), the boundary may extend out of the bioregion where development will occur, likely following (sub)catchment boundaries.          \r\n\r\nThe principles for aquatic ecosystems are similar, with a stronger emphasis on catchment or sub-catchment boundaries, and the extent of underlying aquifers that support ground-water dependent ecosystems; and also noting the need to sensibly limit the spatial extent of the study  in relation to downstream catchment areas, especially where there is no feasible impact pathway.\r\n\r\nThese principles were applied to derive the proposed Beetaloo GBA extended region boundary, primarily based on the boundaries of the Birdum (STU3) and Newcastle (STU2) subregions of the Sturt Plateau Bioregion.  In order to explain where and why it deviates from these subregions boundaries, starting at the northern edge and moving counter clockwise:\r\n-\tthe northern edge follows the bioregion boundary.  Importantly, this corresponds to the Roper River in the Mataranka springs area.  For this section, the boundary has been extended to capture the Mataranka Thermal Pools. The north western edge also captures the springs feeding toward the Flora River, but may need to check this and adjust slightly so that these GDEs are included\r\n-\ton the western edge, the boundary diverts from the bioregion and follows the boundary of the Daly and then Roper Drainage Basins, and then cuts southward to rejoin the southern boundary of the Newcastle subregion.  This pragmatically exclude some of the most western extent of STU3 and STU2, which are geographically distant from the gas basin, and which are unlikely to add useful regional context to any of the ecology values. The GDE’s on the King River in the northwest have been included within the boundary.\r\n-\tIt is considered essential to include Lake Woods in the study area, so a portion of the boundary of Mitchell Grass Downs (MGD2) is used to do this. The boundary then cuts across the top of the Mitchell Grass Downs to rejoin the STU2 boundary\r\n-\tThe boundary cuts north to meet and use the western boundary of the McArthur River Basin – this excludes the most eastern extent of STU2, for similar reasons as above for excluding the most western extent\r\n-\tIn the eastern section, the most easterly extent of the Beetaloo sub-basin just enters the Gulf Fall Bioregion.  This is ecologically very different to the Sturt Plateau, and so the requirement to sample in this area needs to be sensibly constrained.  A 20km buffer from the edge of the gas basin.  The boundary therefore encompasses the headwaters of some drainages that flow into the Limmen and Roper Rivers.   \r\n-\tThe boundary then follows the STU bioregion boundary back to the northern edge.   This includes the upper reaches of the Strangways River and Maryfield Creek.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was derived using: NTGS Beetaloo Sub-basin boundary (A7710381-78BF-4E1F-B015-A9E874599F47), the DoEE Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (Subregions - States and Territories) v. 7 (IBRA) (F83F319E-C369-4548-BBEC-3AAD7AB40AE8), and GBA Beetaloo basin GDE (E4C2B147-8338-4821-BC5E-DE300E9B6362) as its data sources.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 6. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\n*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of\r\nnational land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests\r\nReport 2018*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory\r\ngovernment agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then\r\ncombined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of\r\nAustralia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for\r\napplication to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature\r\nconservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved\r\ntenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "    \n\nDefinition: Mean annual dissolved concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil\nwater (mg of nitrogen per kg of water), averaged for both soil layers.\nInterpretation: The dissolved N concentration is calculated as the ratio of\nthe mineral N store to soil water store, which assumes that all the mineral N\nis in solution. Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these\nstores, but not on their ratio. The pattern of mineral N concentrations is\nexplained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N\nstore (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air\ndryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy\nlimitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that\ndecreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-\narid tropical environments. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes (1) current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation; (2) current agricultural inputs of nutrients\n(nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertiliser, legume crops, and legume pastures;\n(3) current nutrient offtakes by product removal (harvest, stock).\nNMnlConc0.Agric a Mean annual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water\n(mgN kgH2O-1) in the aAgrica (present day) scenario NMnlConc0.Base a Mean\nannual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water (mgN kgH2O-1) in the\naBasea (pre-1788) scenario Data is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_cmnswr9cl\n__02811a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The project includes:\n<ul><li>a new web portal to make it easier for the community to report wombats to capture where in the landscape healthy and unhealthy populations of wombats are occurring and so wildlife volunteers can quickly assess treatment options available.(please contact access Canberra for wildlife injured on our roads requiring immediate attention)</li><li>a new spatial support tool that maps wombat populations to help us understand the extent of mange and its effects on populations and to facilitate coordinated monitoring and treatment</li><li>an innovative research effort that will trial the remote delivery of a more effective and longer lasting mange treatment ACT Wildlife and Wombat Rescue are partnering with government on the project in an excellent example of how government and community volunteers can work together for good outcomes for a species in trouble. The University of Tasmania is providing advice from its own research and trials.</li></ul>\n\nThe wombat mange project progresses a commitment under the Parliamentary Agreement of the 10th Legislative Assembly to fund ACT Wildlife to undertake mange treatment in the ACT. Collaboratively, the ACT Government and community volunteers will deliver a coordinated and comprehensive mange treatment program across the ACT.\n\nThe project is part of a wider wombat management project being developed within ACT Government.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2020 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Picnic Point Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes the central part of the suburb of Picnic\nPoint. The northern part of the catchment is predominantly urban; the southern part includes parts of\nthe Georges River National Park, in particular the Yeramba Lagoon. The catchment drains gradually\nsouth, through a stormwater pipe network towards the Georges River. The Sydney South Electricity\nSubstation is also located within the Picnic Point catchment. The Picnic Point catchment is wholly\nwithin the southern section of Bankstown City Council Local Government Area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 170 stormwater pits and 200 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Picnic Point Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

Council monitors the water quality at 11 sites in the Brisbane River and sections of Moreton Bay, which have high rates of recreational use. The datasets derived from the monitoring are published and warning signs are put in place where required.\n\nInformation on water quality monitoring can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/environment-and-water/water-and-air-quality/water-quality-monitoring\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.\n\nThis dataset consists of the level of microbial contamination within Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. Brisbane City Council monitors of enterococci bi-monthly in summer and monthly during the cooler winter months. The presence of high levels of enterococci can vary daily, and may be elevated after heavy rainfall. Enterococci exposure can contribute to increased health risk and primary contact should be avoided.\n\nThe Data and resources section of this dataset contains further information for this dataset.",

    "title": "Australian lamb: Financial performance of lamb producers, 2013-14 to 2015-16 - Research report 16.9",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for lamb producers for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Lamb producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that sold, on average, 200 or more lambs for slaughter a year over the three years ending 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income of lamb producing farms rose on average over the period 2013-14 to 2014-15. The majority of the rise in farm incomes came from higher beef and lamb receipts due to increased prices and sales for both commodities. Average farm cash income of lamb producing farms is estimated to have increased further in 2015-16 mainly as a result of increased crop, wool and beef cattle sales. \r\n• Average incomes of lamb producing farms are estimated to have risen from 2014-15 to 2015-16 in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The majority of the increase in farm incomes in these states was from higher cropping receipts. \r\n• In real terms, the estimated average farm incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 were among the highest recorded since 2001-02. \r\n• Rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for lamb producers fell marginally from 2.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 2.5 per cent in 2014-15. The average rate of return is estimated to have increased in 2015-16 to around 3.0 per cent, reflecting higher incomes. \r\n• Average debt for lamb producers increased in real terms by around 88 per cent from $323 000 in 2000-01 (in 2015-16 dollars) to an estimated $605 000 in 2015-16. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of increases in average farm size and borrowing for land purchase, as well as for ongoing working capital. \r\n• Overall, changes in average debt over time have been modest relative to lamb producers' capacity to service debt by generating income. On average, around 8 per cent of lamb producers' farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments over the 10 years to 2015-16. In 2015-16 an estimated 6 per cent of farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments. \r\n",

These treatments were chosen to bracket the range of atmospheric CO2 levels predicted for different end-of-century emission scenarios in the near-future (2100). Each treatment was replicated across four aquaria, each with 2 duplicate pots per species.\n\nC. serrulata and H. uninervis were collected from the intertidal meadow at Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef (19°10.88¿S, 146°50.63¿E) in late March 2013. T. hemprichii was collected from Green Island in the Northern Great Barrier Reef (16°45.37¿S, 145°58.19¿E) in early April 2013. H. uninervis and sediment was collected as intact plugs. C. serrulata and T. hemprichii were collected by excavating intact shoots with connected horizontal rhizomes from the sediment. The experiment started two to four weeks after the collection.\n\nPhotosynthetic rates and respiration of the second youngest leaf of a haphazardly chosen shoot from each pot were measured using optical oxygen sensors. Photosynthetic rates were measured over a series of light steps (10, 30, 70, 110, 220, 400, 510 µmol m-2 s-1), with each light step lasting 20 minutes. Rates were normalised to the dry weight of the leaf, after drying leaves at 60°C for 48 hours. To determine photosynthetic parameters (Pmax, alpha, Ek, Ec), photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-E) data plots were fitted to the adapted hyperbolic tangent model equation of Jassby and Platt (1976). Net productivity (NP) was taken to be the photosynthetic rate measured at the experimental light level (400 µmol m-2 s-1). Energetic surplus (PG:R) was calculated as the ratio of gross productivity to dark respiration rate. \n\nTo measure growth rates, all shoots were marked at the top of the sheath with a needle at the start of the experiment. After 14 days, the shoots were harvested, the length of new tissue growth were excised, dried at 60°C for 48 hours and weighed for determination of weight of new leaf growth. Leaf tissue growth was normalised to the aboveground biomass to derive relative leaf growth rates (RGR). Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated by dividing total leaf area with the total biomass of the leaves.\n\nChlorophyll content was determined by acetone extraction of chlorophyll from a young mature leaf from each pot at the end of the experiment. \nTo determine non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content, roots and rhizomes were dried at 60°C for 48 hours, before being homogenised. Soluble carbohydrates were extracted with 80% ethanol at 80°C. The amount of soluble carbohydrates was assayed after removal of phenolic compounds and acid hydrolysis. Starch content was analysed from the residue of the soluble carbohydrate extraction through enzyme (amylase and amyloglucosidase) digestion. The concentration of glucose is measured using a commercially available glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) testing reagent (Megazyme). Absorbance was then measured at 510 nm. Total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content was the sum of the amount of soluble carbohydrates and starch content.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nComma Separated File (CSV)\n\n\nData Dictionary:\n\nseagrass_pCO2only.csv:\n\n- pH: Average of the calculated pH of the aquarium over the experimental period.\n- pCO2 (uatm): average pCO2 levels over two weeks.\n- Temp_real (oC): Average of measured temperatures of the aquarium over the experimental period (N=3).

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2017. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "Current meter and tide gauge data obtained from an off-shore mooring near Jervis Bay: 05/04/89 - 07/12/89",
    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed in 100m of water, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular, Jervis Bay. This mooring housed 3 current meters (at 30m, 55m and 90m water depth) and also a tide gauge. Over a period of approx. 8 months the mooring was deployed 3 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1 - 35.16 S, 150.817 E. \nDeployments 2 & 3 - 35.1267 S, 150.825 E. Datasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the three current meters over the study period.\n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 3 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2 & 3) for the upper two meters at 30m and 55m water depth. The current meter at 90m utilised sampling intervals of 10mins (deployments 1 & 2) and 30mins (deployment 3). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 11/4/89 - 5/6/89... 2) 28/7/89 - 29/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 29/11/89\n\nTIDE GAUGE: The tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~100m for all three deployments  In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n The dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\nThe Clarence-Moreton Asset database V6.1 supersedes the previous version (Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 11 December 2014, minor version v20150603 GUID = 248361ac-2495-4228-a4e4-e3c6cabf7433) of the Asset database. \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v6.1  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150819.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150819_GISOnly.gdb), the Water Dependant Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150819.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.

    "title": "Victorian Alpine Resorts - Daily Snow Depth Records Lake Mountain",
    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\nAsset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 26 February 2016 (V2) supersedes the previous version of the SSB Asset database V1.1 (Asset database for the Sydney Basin bioregion on 18 December 2015, GUID: d7dd32e7-a0cc-4537-a280-c71f4be87e01). It contains the Asset database (SSB_asset_database_20160226.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (SSB_asset_database_20160226_GISOnly.gdb), the draft Water Dependent Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-SYD-SSB-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-v20160226.xlsx), a data dictionary (SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the Water Asset Information Tool (WAIT) process as outlined below. This version should be used for Materiality Test (M2) test.\n\nThe user needs to join the Table Assetlist  or Elementlist  to the spatial data.\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Sydney regions are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Sydney bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"SSB_asset_database_doc_20160226.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. \n\nThe most obvious change in relative abundance in core BAR9403 (off the coast of Sumatra) is shown by sub-polar to transitional 'upwelling' species Ga. bulloides with abundances of 26% at approximately 14,000yrs BP and 22.7% during the Holocene. This is compared to the periods from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) where the relative abundance of Ga. bulloides is generally <10%. Gr. menardii, a tropical 'upwelling' species, also increases its relative abundance during MIS 2 from <8% during MIS 3 to a peak abundance of 16% at ~17,000yrs BP.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Peth (West) - Northbridge in WA with SA2 code 503021297, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a register (known as the Charity Register), which contains information about charities. This dataset is a subset of the information available on the Charity Register.\r\n\r\nAdditional information for each charity (including governing documents and names of any Responsible Persons) can be found by searching the Charity Register at [acnc.gov.au/charity](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nIn some situations, charities can apply to have some or all of their information withheld from the Charity Register.  If the ACNC has approved for the information to be withheld, it won’t appear on the Charity Register, or in this dataset. \r\n\r\nEach year, charities also lodge Annual Information Statements with the ACNC. These record further information about charities’ purposes, activities and operations for the year - the ACNC publishes datasets for each Annual Information Statement. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data.

    "description": "Three pressure-sensor water-level recorders were deployed, at HMAS Creswell (Orange mooring), off Bowen Island (Black mooring) and off Point Perpendicular (Yellow mooring). These sensors recorded water level and water temperature at 10 minute intervals commencing on 05/12/88 and  finishing on 11/01/89. \n\nThe Yellow mooring line at Point Perpendicular broke during recovery, and was not recovered by divers until the 08/02/89. This tide gauge was (unintentionally) deployed on rocky steep sloping banks. The water level record revealed that the instrument had slipped down the steep banks on several occasions producing instantaneous changes in water level of up to 1m. These were removed from the data record. \n\nThe Black mooring was located at 35.1117 S 150.767 E with a sensor depth of 11m. \nThe Orange mooring was located at 35.1206 S 150.704 E with a sensor depth of 13m. \nThe Yellow mooring was located at 35.0967 S 150.802 E with a sensor depth of 20m.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

    "title": "Biological records for National Park islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef (NERP TE 9.3, JCU)",
    "description": "The database contains native and alien species records for National Park islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Attributes for each record include information on abundance, life history traits, habitat requirements, limitations of source, and relevant species information from government bodies including EPBC and NCA listings. Basic interaction information among species (alien vs. native) is also recorded. This dataset also has basic information about the islands such as area, location, and regional ecosystem types present on the island. \n\nOne shapefile, Island Threats, contains information on the presence and absence of a number of animals and plant threats on islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef as elicited from experts. Each spatially explicit point represents data for a given species on a specific island.\n\nAnother shapefile, Regional Ecosystems, contains information on the various Queensland Herbarium regional ecosystem (RE) types extracted for National Park Islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Individual polygons represent an area of a specific RE type.\n\nThe last shapefile, Features on Islands, contains information on the abundance of a number of native animals on islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef as elicited from experts. Each spatially explicit point represents data for a given species on a specific island.\n\nThis database was created as a basis for the decision support tool being developed for NERP 9.3. The database is the most complete dataset for the islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef at the time of release. \n\n\nMethod:\n\nDatabase:\nA comprehensive literature review was conducted for all published and ¿grey¿ source material containing biological records for National Park islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Unpublished species records were also compiled from sources such as WildNet, the Queensland Herbarium, and personal communications. For a given source, each species on each island received a unique record. Records were structured within the database so that each record remained associated with its source, allowing revisitation in order to review records within their original context. Attributes relevant to each record were extracted from source, including information on habitat requirements, life history traits, abundance, and source limitations e.g. incomplete sampling of island area. Additional attributes for each record were extracted from the Australian and Queensland government websites, including information on EBPC and CNA listings, and endemicity. \n\nIsland Threats:\nExperts who frequent the islands were consulted as to whether they believed a given threat was present or absent on the islands. These data were input into the associated access database Island_database.accbd, and then transformed into the point based shapefile.\n\nThe following is the list of threats considered in this dataset.\n* African Big Headed Ant\n* Black Rat\n* Brushtail Possum\n* Cane toad\n* Climbing Asparagus\n* Cobblers Peg\n* Red Junglefowl\n* Dwarf Poinsettia\n* Eastern Grey Kangaroo\n* Feral Cat\n* Feral Cattle\n* Feral Goat\n* Feral Horse\n* Feral Pig\n* Fox\n* Green Panic\n* Groundsel\n* Guinea Grass\n* Hog Deer\n* House Mouse\n* House Sparrow\n* Lantana\n* Morning Glory\n* Mother of Millions\n* Nightshade\n* Noogoora Burr\n* Periwinkle\n* Rubbervine\n* Singapore Daisy\n* Sisal Hemp\n* Soft Scale\n* Yellow Guava\n* Molasses Grass\n* Mossman River Grass\n* Mother-in-Law Tongue\n* Pink Periwinkle\n* Prickly Pear\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\nShape files of regional ecosystem (RE) types and National Park Islands in the Southern GBR were obtained from Queensland Herbarium (in 2014). These data were rearranged and merged to create a single shape file.\n\neAtlas editor note: It was noticed when mapping this shapefile that many of the polygon regions had multiple overlapping features, sometimes consisting of duplicates, and sometimes containing multiple RE codes. The cause of this in the dataset is unknown. A map of these overlaps was made by rendering them as black transparent polygons. This map is available in the download section of this metadata record. \n\nFeatures on Islands:\nExperts who frequent the islands were consulted as to the maximum and minimum number of individuals/pairs of native species on the islands. On each island there are multiple estimates for each species, one from each expert.\n\nThe following is the set of species that are included in this dataset.\n* Anous minutus (Black noddy)\n* Anous stolidus (Brown noddy)\n* Burhinus grallarius (Bush stone-curlew)\n* Calyptorhynchus lathami (Glossy black cockatoo)\n* Caretta caretta (Loggerhead sea turtle)\n* Charadrius ruficapillus (Red-capped plover)\n* Chelonia mydas (Green sea turtle)\n* Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae (Silver gull)\n* Egretta sacra (Pacific reef heron)\n* Epthianura crocea (Yellow chat)\n* Esacus magnirostris (Beach stone-curlew)\n* Falco peregrinus (Peregrine falcon)\n* Fregata ariel (Lesser frigatebird)\n* Fregata minor (Great frigatebird)\n* Gallirallus philippensis (Buff-banded rail)\n* Haematopus fuliginosus (Sooty oystercatcher)\n* Haematopus longirostris (Pied oystercatcher)\n* Haliaeetus leucogaster (White-bellied sea eagle)\n* Haliastur indus (Brahminy kite)\n* Hydroprogne caspia (Caspian tern)\n* Megapodius reinwardt (Orange-footed scrubfowl)\n* Natator depressus (Flatback sea turtle)\n* Onychoprion anaethetus (Bridled tern)\n* Onychoprion fuscata (Sooty tern)\n* Pandion cristatus (Osprey)\n* Phaethon rubricauda (Red-tailed tropicbird)\n* Phalacrocorax varius (Australian pied cormorant)\n* Phascolarctos cinereus (Koala)\n* Pluvialis squatarola (Grey plover)\n* Ptilinopus regina (Rose-crowned fruit dove)\n* Sterna dougallii (Roseate tern)\n* Sterna sumatrana (Black-naped tern)\n* Sternula albifrons (Little tern)\n* Sula dactylatra (Masked booby)\n* Sula leucogaster (Brown booby)\n* Thalasseus bengalensis (Lesser crested tern)\n* Thalasseus bergii (Greater crested tern)\n* Tringa brevipes (Grey-tailed tattler)\n* Xeromys myoides (False Water Rat)\n* Zosterops lateralis (Silvereye)\n\nFurther information on the methodology can be found in the final report for this project: Pressey, R., Wenger, A. (2015) Prioritising Management Actions for Great Barrier Reef Islands.\nhttp://www.nerptropical.edu.au/sites/default/files/publications/files/NERP9.3_final_report-FINAL-Complete.pdf\n\n\nLimitations of the data:\n\nDatabase:\nAbundance data varies over different units of time. For example in the ¿Total¿ column, 100 might indicate 100 individuals observed in a single survey, or over repeated visits to an island. The units of observation are maintained in the ¿Abundance¿ column, e.g. 100/birds January 2000. Values in the ¿Total¿ column should be interpreted in conjunction with the ¿Abundance¿ column.\nWe have removed any data for which we have data sharing agreements. Therefore, the database used for this project is much more comprehensive than we are able to submit.  \n\nIsland Threats:\nThe shapefile is limited to presence or absences only for a focal number of threats on targeted islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. There is no data on the number of individuals or the extent of the species on the islands. The presence or absence of a species is based on general consensus by experts. If there is no point for a given island/threat pair then the presence of absence of the species on that island is unknown.\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\nThe shapefile is limited to National Park Islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Information on RE types on other islands exists but was not the focus of this work. In some cases multiple polygons of the same shape and size exist for the same region of an island. Here a number of RE types were recorded within the polygon/area but the exact spatial extent of the RE is unknown, only the percentage of the polygon/area that the RE covers.\n\nFeatures on Islands:\nThe shapefile is limited to best guess estimates of the maximum and minimum number of individuals/pairs of a select number of native species on an island. The extent of the species on the island and how the population has changed over time are not known.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nIsland_database.accbd\nFormat: Access database.\nThis database contains a number of tables which are categorised according to their name:\n1 \"Records:¿\" are record tables where each row is a specific record relating to the focus of the table.\n2 \"Attributes:¿\" are attribute tables which have information specific to each category (e.g. islands, native animals, regional ecosystems. Attribute tables typically list the primary keys for each category which link to the records tables. \n3 \"Stats:¿\" are tables that contain basic statistics on records tables. These have been created using queries and will have queries with associated query names. \n4 \"Queries:¿\" are tables that have been created from queries (other than specific statistics queries) run on records/attributes tables and will have queries with associated query names. \n\nThis database also contains a number of queries which are based on the records/attributes tables, a most of which are linked to stats or queries tables of an associated name. See the ¿Design View¿ of any of the tables for more information, in particular for column/field descriptions. \n\nIsland Threats:\nThreats_on_Islands.*, GIS shape file \nProjected Coordinate System: GDA_1994_MGA_Zone_55\nProjection: Transverse_Mercator\n\n\nData dictionary:\n\n- Isl_name: name of the island where the record occurs\n- LONG: x co-ordinate location of the island (descimal degrees)\n- LAT: y co-ordinate location of the island (descimal degrees)\n- Threat: Common name of the threat\n- Interactio: Whether the threat species is present (1) or absent (0) on the island\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\n\nRE_on_NP_Islands.*, GIS shape file\nProjected Coordinate System: GDA_1994_MGA_Zone_55\nProjection: Transverse_Mercator\n\n\nData dictionary:\n\n- RE_type: Code for the regional ecosystem type, see associated access database Island_database.accbd for RE type descriptions\n- PC_of_Poly: percentage of the polygon that the RE covers.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was produced by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program to assess the vegetation water use characteristics in the Cooper GBA region. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. This dataset was produced from MODIS ETa images and Landsat images. The updated TERN AET dataset (see https://www.tern.org.au/news-australia-wide-aet-data/) has several key improvements implemented which means it supersedes the Landsat-MODIS blended AET developed for the GBA Program. The GBA AET data are still valid for use in analysis. This dataset contains a detailed metadata statement, including technical details regarding the original dataset.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset contains the Landsat-MODIS blended 8-day AET images for the Cooper GBA region from Feb 2000 to Sep 2018. The main source datasets include 1) AET images derived from 8-day MODIS c6 product by CSIRO Land and Water, 2) Landsat reflectance images provided by GA Datacube on NCI. This dataset has been superseded by the updated TERN AET dataset (see https://www.tern.org.au/news-australia-wide-aet-data/) but is still valid for use in analysis.",

    "description": "Land and emergency management agencies in Australia and\noverseas recognise the importance of an access network to support bushfire\nmanagement activities. Ground and aerial access provides a platform for fire\nreduction and readiness activities and provides opportunities to contain fires\nbefore they escalate into major fires that could otherwise incur significant\ncosts and potentially significant losses to community, cultural and\nenvironmental values.\n\n\nFire access within the ACT consists of a network of roads,\ntracks and trails that support fire prevention, readiness and response\nactivities. The identification and maintenance of fire access is an integral\nelement of fire management across the ACT.\n\n\nAccess management is divided into four areas :\n\n\n1.     maintenance\n\n\n2.     upgrade\n\n\n3.     construction\n\n\n4.     vegetation removal.\n\n\nACT PCS Fire Management Unit currently manage and maintain\napproximately 3,218 kilometres of roads and fire trails within the ACT. The\nclassification of fire roads, tracks and trails is performance based to provide\nclear guidance to response agencies during incidents.\n\n\nGround access is defined in four classes :\n\n\n1.     Float road – an access road\nor trail accessible to a low loader float carrying a large bulldozer or other\nheavy equipment.\n\n\n2.     Tanker road – a fire trail\nof strategic importance accessible to a heavy tanker and a tipper carrying a\nsmall bulldozer.\n\n\n3.     Light unit trail – a fire\ntrail accessible at minimum standard for a light unit.\n\n\n4.     Dormant fire trail – a trail\nthat has been deliberately closed or not maintained and can be quickly\nre-opened with minimal works.\n\n\nThe objective of ground access works are to upgrade and\nmaintain road pavements within the parks and reserves of the ACT to the above\nfour classes standard under the current Bushfire Operational Plan. Many areas\nrequire ongoing general maintenance or upgrading to an appropriate standard.\nThis is done principally to provide reliable access for operational\nrequirements and for fire suppression activities in the event of a wildfire\nthat may threaten the ACT.\n\n\nVegetation removal work is conducted by mechanical mulchers\nthat reduce vegetation on roads and trails that impede access for operational\nand fire suppression requirements identified under the current Bushfire\nOperational Plan. The Parks and Conservation Service Fire Management Unit also\ncommit a number of other contracted resources (graders, trucks, rollers,\nexcavators and backhoes etc) to conduct daily scheduled maintenance as well as\nupgrade and construction services on a yearly basis within the ACT.\n\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.actmapi.act.gov.au/\">Bushfire Map</a> shows the Environment, Planning &amp;\nSustainable Development  Directorate (EPSDD) Bushfire Operations Plan\n(BOP) for the current financial year.\n\n\nThe EPSDD BOP is derived from the 5-year Regional Fire\nManagement Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The EPSDD BOP details\nthe specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and\ninfrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current\nfinancial; year, in accordance with the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan\n(SBMP).\n\n\n",

The data has been aggregated following the 2011 Local Government Areas (LGA) with available data.\nThe data in your reports are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Government Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere the recorded number of settlers is less than 5, the data has been set to null for confidentiality.\n\n\nSettlers which do not have a recorded LGA have been removed from the data.\n\n",

The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55.

    "title": "Potential displacement of commercial fisheries by a Commonwealth marine reserve zoning scheme",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The Government commissioned an independent review of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves that were originally proclaimed in November 2012. The Department of the Environment commissioned ABARES to assess potential displacement of commercial fishing by alternative marine reserve designs and zoning options considered by the Bioregional Advisory Panel. The report details potential displacement by the network proclaimed in 2012 and the network recommended by the Panel in 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  • The potential impact of the Panel recommended (2015) zoning on commercial fisheries in the regions is relatively small, compared with the total gross value of production (GVP) from all wild capture fisheries. However, while much of the total impact is diffuse, some of the potential impact is concentrated in particular fisheries, entitlement holders and towns. \r\n• The Panel recommended (2015) zoning would potentially displace an estimated annual average 587.6 t of catch, with an annual average GVP of $4.51 million. This is less than the proclaimed network (2012), which would displace 1032 t of catch, with a GVP of $8.21 million. \r\n• For individual entitlements, there are a large number for which the potential impacts of the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning are relatively low (more than 700 entitlements with less than $2500 displaced per year) and a small number of entitlements for which the potential impacts are higher (17 entitlements over $50 000). The largest displacement from one entitlement was $164 000. These figures do not include South Australian entitlements because ABARES did not receive fisheries data at this scale for South Australian fisheries. A single business unit may hold multiple entitlements and so the impact on a business unit would be the sum of the individual entitlement impacts. \r\n• At the fishery level, the largest GVP displacements from the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning would be from the Western Australian West Coast Rock Lobster Fishery ($823 000), Commonwealth Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery ($585 800) and Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery ($488 200). \r\n• In terms of the proportion of GVP from the entire fishery, the largest displacements would be from the Commonwealth Coral Sea Fishery (71.2 per cent of fishery GVP), Western Australian North Coast Shark Fishery (33.9 per cent) and the Western Australian South West Trawl Fishery (13.2 per cent). \r\n• Towns with the highest potential GVP displacement were Mooloolaba in Queensland ($515 100), Geraldton in Western Australia ($449 200) and Fremantle in Western Australia ($406 300). \r\n• The estimated net economic impact of the Panel-recommended network would be reduced regional economic activity of $7.9 million in the short term. Potential short term employment impacts were separately estimated at 18 total jobs (estimate derived from previous economic modelling) and 49 jobs (estimate derived from previous surveys of fishers). Changes in economic activity at the state / territory level are expected to be negligible in terms of the size of the economies. These estimates have been made by rescaling previous economic modelling and survey results (from 2012); ABARES was not commissioned to undertake new economic modelling or surveys. \r\n\r\n Note: This document is hosted on the Department of Environment website.

    "description": "The Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project, a collaboration between NCRIS facilities, AURIN, PHRN, and researchers, aims to improve understanding of urban and regional health. This dataset, developed with Cancer Council Queensland and the Australian Cancer Atlas, provides spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes in Queensland, exploring associations between various determinants and cancer patterns. The dataset’s goal is to identify spatial variations in breast cancer outcomes within Queensland, and motivate further research into their drivers.\nThis dataset includes seven spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes for Queensland women, modeled using Bayesian statistics, covering the period of 2000-2019. These indicators, presented as Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) with 95% credible intervals and posterior probability differences (ppd), are at the Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2). The dataset provides modelled statistical indicators and geographic data, covering breast cancer outcomes, spatial epidemiology, health disparities, and cancer surveillance at the SA2 level (2016 ASGS) in Queensland, Australia. The intended application is for identifying geographical disparities in breast cancer, informing public health planning, and enabling further research.\nThe methodology uses linked health datasets from the Queensland Cancer Register, BreastScreen Queensland, and the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patients Data Collection. Bayesian spatial models with Besag-Yorke-Mollié (BYM) priors were applied, using a Poisson distribution with the log of expected counts as an offset, and incorporating spatial terms for neighboring regions. Models were validated using trace plots, density plots, Moran’s I statistics, and Geweke statistics.\nThe data is structured as a table, with each row representing an SA2 region, and columns representing indicator values and associated metrics. The complete attribute dictionary for the dataset is shown below:\n\nsa2: Five digital sa2 code using 2016 ASGS\nsa2name: Name of each sa2 area\n\nurban: Categorical variable with three levels: 1. brisbane/gold coast; 2. Cairns; 3. Rest of Queensland, with the first two representing the urban areas in Queensland. Categorised based on sa3 name.\n\n\nsir_incidence: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in incidence of breast cancer. SIR is using the total Queensland cohort as the reference population.\n\nlow_cri_incidence: The lower bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_incidence.\nhigh_cri_incidence: The higher bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_incidence.\n\nppd_incidence: The posterior probability difference of sir_incidence outcome, with ppd&gt;0.6 showing a significant difference from the Queensland average.\n\n\nsir_localised: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in proportion of invasive breast cancers that were diagnosed when localised. SIR is using the total Queensland cohort as the reference population.\n\nlow_cri_localised: The lower bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_localised.\nhigh_cri_localised: The higher bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_localised.\n\nppd_localised: The posterior probability difference of sir_localised outcome, with ppd&gt;0.6 showing a significant difference from the Queensland average.\n\n\nsir_survive5yrs: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in surviving at least five years among women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual fishing effort by fishery and gear, that fishers have recorded in their logbooks for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea. Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nFishing effort is measured differently depending on the fishing method used. In this dataset we provide the most common measures that are used by scientists. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe effort data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Effort data are used in combination with catch data, spatial data, and other relevant information (such as independent surveys) to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time-period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may standardise effort for assessments to account for issues such as changes in gear efficiency, catchability of fish and skipper expertise. They may also filter out effort from their assessments because of data quality issues.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect effort each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as closures of fishing areas or reducing boat numbers. Similarly, changes in market demand can change fishing decisions and affect effort. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1989 to February 1990. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset represents measurements collected from a network of 75 urban glow sensors within the Bundaberg Region. The principal data sets are point data representing the readings from the Sky Quality Meter (SQM) sensors. Data from all sensors are processed every 15 minutes using natural neighbour interpolation to generate a raster of urban glow across two sub-networks (City and Coastal).\r\n\r\n__Vector Point Data__\r\n\r\nThe point data are contained as individual feature classes for each processing time within an ArcGIS file geodatabase\r\n\r\n* ID: The SQM site identifier\r\n* Description: The locality and the number of the SQM in that locality.\r\n* deviceGroup: The categorisation of the SQM devices for processing of the data within sub-networks (i.e. coastal network or city network)\r\n* obsLocalTime: The date and time in Australian Eastern Standard time (UTC+10) of the observation\r\n* magnitude: SQM reading is a numeric value indicating the relative brightness of the night sky. Lower numbers indicate a brighter sky, while higher numbers indicate a darker sky. A dark sky with minimal light pollution typically registers as 22 or above. Units are measured in magnitudes per square arc second.\r\n* skyTemp: The temperature of the nearest object (i.e. clouds) in a 10 degree field of view above the sensor. This value will be low if there is nothing, but higher if there is cloud.\r\n* ambTemp: Measurement of ambient air temperature taken at the specified point in time.\r\n* cloudCover: skyTemp & ambTemp reading values are translated as follows:\r\n    * no cloud cover\r\n    * minimal effects from cloud cover\r\n    * moderate/medium effects from cloud cover\r\n    * high impact from cloud cover\r\n\r\n__Raster Data__\r\n \r\nA Natural Neighbour interpolation has been performed using the sites with valid SQM values to produce a Geotiff raster to depict the hot spots or bright areas of urban glow\r\n\r\n__Mapbooks__\r\n\r\nThe input points and the generated hotspot raster are compiled into a nightly PDF map book for easy interpretation of the results.\r\n\r\nThe Reducing Urban Glow project page can be found here https://www.bundaberg.qld.gov.au/environment/reducing-urban-glow",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program seeks to understand the potential impacts associated with developing unconventional energy resources in key Australian basins. As a potential source of land use change, future seismic data acquisition may cause cumulative land change that may need to be quantified for such a holistic impact assessment. Given the extent of seismic exploration for conventional resources within the Cooper Basin, existing data could provide insight into survey parameters that may be representative of future surveys in the region. We perform an analysis of the historical seismic survey occurrence and acquisition parameters for the existing data in the Cooper GBA region. The spatio-temporal data analysis is used to derive a simple model that could be used as a forecasting tool for seismic survey parameters of interest (e.g. line kilometers) in a forward looking risk assessment.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis presents a data analysis of the datasets: \r\n•\tSeismic survey 3D - QLD\r\n•\tSeismic survey 2D - QLD\r\n•\tSouth Australian 2D Seismic Lines \r\n•\tSouth Australia 3D Seismic Survey Areas\r\n•\tPetroleum well locations – Queensland\r\n•\tPetroleum well locations - South Australia",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of areas subject to overland flow flooding inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. \n\nThe overall overland flow layer consists of the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (100 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) flood extent sourced from the Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path mapping study (GHD, 2017).\n\nHigh impact area:\n\nIn high impact areas, overland flow is almost certain to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 5% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings.\n\nMedium impact area:\n\nFor the majority of medium impact areas, overland flow is very likely to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 2% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings, however these hazards are experienced less frequently than in high impact areas.\n\nLow impact area:\n\nFor the majority of low impact areas, overland flow is likely to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally safe for people, vehicles and buildings; however, certain areas can experience greater hazards.\n\nlink in the Data and resources section on this page.\n\nDue to a system issue, this data is not displayed here.

    "description": "A 6m steel pole has been installed within Central Bommie within the main lagoon of One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the main lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the main lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity. The pole is available for mounting of additional third part instruments and so forms an infrastructure to support future observational work at the Island.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Every day, individuals and organisations enter into contracts for building and construction – and sometimes disputes arise over payment.\n\nThe Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2002 (known as the SOP Act) helps ensure that any person who carries out construction work or supplies related goods and services under a construction contract gets paid.\n\nIt is designed to provide a fast and inexpensive process to recover payments due under a construction contract, without the need for lawyers to become involved.\n\nThe Building and Plumbing Commission (BPC), formerly Victorian Building Authority (VBA), monitors the operation of the SOP Act.  It does not nominate adjudicators or take part in payment disputes. This is the role of Authorised Nominating Authorities (ANAs) who are authorised by the BPC to perform this service\n\nThe data covers adjudications that have occurred in the context the SOP Act.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Leadbeater's possum  Gymnobelideus leadbeateri  is a listed threatened species found mainly in montane ash and snowgum forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, with a small occurrence in swamp forests in Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Threats to the species include wildfire, loss of hollow-bearing trees, and the harvesting of native forests. As a consequence, the species is a focus of sustainable forest management. \r\n\r\n The species was nominated for re-listing as Critically Endangered under the  Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  (EPBC Act) in 2013, from its previous category of endangered, with comments on the nomination requested by January 2014. Its listing category was raised from Endangered to Critically Endangered in May 2015, based on the recommendation of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. An updated Draft Recovery Plan for the species was then prepared with input from stakeholders. \r\n\r\n Over the period from 2013 to 2017, ABARES prepared briefing notes regarding the listing, conservation, recovery and management of Leadbeater's possum and the related issue of fire and forest harvesting. This publication brings together a series of these briefing notes. \r\n\r\n The briefing notes are presented as written at the dates indicated, except that occasional minor or typographical errors have been corrected, URLs updated, intra- and inter-departmental references removed, and footnotes now include clarifying amendments. The briefing notes are individually paginated. ",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "title": "Mammals Remnant Patches",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is a shapefile for 16 catchments in the Gloucester area selected to calibrate the surface water model. Out of the 16, four contribute to the Gloucester or Karuah river basins, including the Barrington River at Forbesdale (calibration gauge 208006), Gloucester River at Gloucester (208020), Mammy Johnsons River at Pikes Crossing (209002) and Karuah River at Dam site (209018). Of the remaining catchments, five are in the Manning river basin, six are in the Hunter river basin and one is in the Wallis Lake river basin..\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe catchment boundaries were delineated using 1 sect SRTM DEM dataset with 16 selected gauge locations as pour points (see lineage dataset). The new boundaries are better (for modelling purposes) than those delineated using the BOM's Geofabric for all catchments, except for the catchment 209003 where a flaw in the SRTM derived flowpath excluded a valley when compared with the Geofabric. This catchment was manually edited to conform with the Geofabric representation of 209003. Individual contributing area catchments for the 16 selected gauges were then merged into this single shapefile.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) GLO SW Model Calibration Catchments v01.

    "title": "Results of benthic organisms, reef fishes and manta tow surveys of Capricorn Bunker reefs in October 2015 (NESP TWQ 3.7, AIMS)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of summaries of benthic, fish and manta tow surveys conducted in the Capricorn-Bunker Region of the Great Barrier Reef in October 2015. It consists of three tables:\n\n1. A table summarising percent cover of benthic organisms grouped into broad categories from photo transects collected during the monitoring surveys.\n2. A table of average abundance for each reef fish species on the 5 transects in each of the three sites on each reef is presented for the eight reefs surveyed.\n3. A table of the average reef wide coral cover, the mean reef-wide density of crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS), Acanthaster planci and the mean reef-wide density of coral trout for each reef based on manta tow surveys.\n\nThis dataset is an extract from part of the AIMS Long Term Monitoring database.\n\nThe rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in 2004 increased the number and extent of ¿no-take¿ areas within the Park. This project surveys pairs of reefs, one in a ¿no-take¿ or green zone and the other a similar reef where fishing is allowed (blue zone), in five regions of the GBRMP. Green and blue zones will be surveyed for the abundance and size of fishery species, particularly coral trout, as well as wider effects on coral reef communities. Surveys of coral communities are undertaken in the same location as surveys of fishes. Biennial surveys commenced in 2006.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nBenthic surveys:\nCoral communities were surveyed on eight reefs (Boult Reef, Broomfield Reef, Erskine Reef, Fairfax Islands Reef, Hoskyn Islands Reef, Lady Musgrave Reef, Mast Head Reef, North Reef (North)) in the Capricorn-Bunkers region using digital still images taken along five permanent 50 m transects in each of three sites per reef (n = 15 transects). Forty images were selected randomly from the fifty taken per transect for analyses. The benthic organisms under five points per image arranged in a quincunx pattern were identified (n = 200 points per transect). Benthic organisms were identified to the highest taxonomic resolution possible and each organism is assigned a lifeform based on its shape. Data were converted to percent cover and the site averages is presented for each reef surveyed. AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10.  The data summaries the latest survey from a time-series of biennial surveys that commenced in 2006. Temporal trends at each reefs are available on http://data.aims.gov.au/reefpage2/allreefs.jsp\n\nReef fish surveys:\nThe abundance of ten families of conspicuous, diurnally active reef fishes was enumerated using standard underwater visual census techniques. Sites are located in a standard reef slope habitat on the north-eastern flank of each reef between 6 to 12m, and consist of five permanently marked 50 m transect (n=15 per reef). Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were surveyed on one metre wide belt transects while the remaining nine families of large mobile fishes (Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Serranidae and Zanclidae) were counted on five metre wide belts. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 3.\n\nManta tow surveys:\nBroadscale surveys of reef-wide coral cover, densities of crown-of-thorns starfish and of coral trout using manta tows involve a snorkel diver being towed around the perimeter of the reef.  The boat stops every 2 min to allow data to be recorded. See AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 9.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.csv, CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.shp:\nAverage percent cover of groups of benthic organisms on each of 3 sites on survey reefs in the Capricorn-Bunkers, GBR\nDescription of lifeforms are published in the Standard Operation Procedures, Appendix III\nSee: AIMS LTMP Standard Operating Procedure 10\n\nThe following are the classifications in the dataset:\n- Turf algae\n- Tabulate Acropora\n- Coralline algae\n- Branching Acropora\n- Encrusting non-Acropora\n- Sand\n- Massive non-Acropora\n- Macroalgae\n- Submassive non-Acropora\n- Soft coral\n- Digitate Acropora\n- Arb & Enc Soft Coral\n- Arborescent Soft Coral\n- Capitate Soft Coral\n- Foliose non-Acropora\n- Encrusting Acropora\n- Millepora\n- Branching non-Acropora\n- Submassive Acropora\n- Sponge\n- Other organisms\n- Encrusting Soft Coral\n- Zoanthid\n- Bottlebrush Acropora\n- Dead coral (recent)\n- Rubble\n- Lobate Soft Coral\n- Massive Soft Coral\n- Mushroom coral\n- Abiotic\n- Solitary coral\n- Unknown\nThe shapefile was created from the CSV. This process involved truncating the attribute names to comply with 10 character limit of the shapefile format. The CapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Benthic_2015-10.aliases.csv file contains a lookup table that maps the shortened attribute names in the shapefile to the original longer names in CSV file.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Fish_2015-10.csv:\nConsists of a summary of the raw counts of reef fishes. The average abundance for each reef fish species per 1,000 m2  is presented for each of the 3 sites on the eight reefs surveyed in October 2015. Note: this table also includes rows for species that were searched for, but none were observed. These correspond to rows where the abundance is 0.\n\nCapBunk_NESP-TWQ-3-7_AIMS_Manta-tow_2015-10.csv:\nSummary of the manta tow results for the surveyed reefs, including the mean hard coral cover (average over all tows on reef), CoTS (count per tow) and trout (count per tow). \n\n\nData Location:\n\nThis dataset is saved in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\NESP1\\3.7_GBR_Zoning\\",

    "description": "Since the 1980s the managers of alpine resorts have collected information on visitation numbers.  Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

There are four main types of SQID: Filter, Gross Pollution Trap (GPT), Trash Rack and Wetland. A filter is used to block finer particles and sediments. A GPT is used to block debris typically larger than 3mm. A Trash Rack is a series of metal vertical and/or horizontal metal bars positioned across a drainage channel and designed to intercept litter and debris. A wetland is a naturally occurring area inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater and capable of sustaining vegetation typically adapted for life in such conditions.",

It comprises a digital map showing the locations of some abandoned penguin colonies (represented by points) and a linked digital database containing additional information. The importance of these sites derives from the fact that a chronology of penguin occupation can be established by radiocarbon dating and this in turn provides a minimum age for deglaciation of the Windmill Islands.\n\nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

    "description": "\n\n\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (stretches of waterway) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. The most abundant species within core MD002361 is the subtropical species Gs. ruber. High abundances =30% are seen during the interglacial periods Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 11, 9, 7, 5 with peak abundance (37.7%) during the Holocene. Other tropical and subtropical species follow this pattern. The transitional, deep dwelling species Gr. inflata has the most distinct abundance change within core MD002361. This species is absent during the interglacial periods but achieves high relative abundances (~20-30%) during glacial periods.",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from Brisbane River inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the overall Flood Awareness Mapping for Brisbane City Council.\n\nRiver flooding happens when widespread, prolonged rainfall occurs over the catchment of a river. As the river reaches capacity, excess water flows over its banks, causing flooding. River flooding can occur hours after the rain has finished, depending on the location within the catchment. The extent of river flooding depends on the severity of the weather and the capacity of the river among other things. The impact on a home depends on how close it is to the river and the proximity to low lying areas.\n\nThere are four different river flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe river flood High likelihood layer consists of the 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) flood extent. The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government.\n\nThe river flood Medium likelihood layer consists of the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) flood extent (outside high likelihood area). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government. \n\nThe river flood Low likelihood layer consists of the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) flood extent (outside high and medium likelihood areas). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government. \n\nThe river flood Very Low likelihood layer consists of the Extent of the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) flood extent (outside high, medium and low likelihood areas). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government.",

    "description": "    \n\nCalculated annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) potential evaporation (mm) for the\nperiod 1980-1999. Calculated by the Priestley-Taylor method. Interpretation:\nPotential evaporation is an expression of the amount of water that it should\nbe possible to evaporate from an open water surface given the prevailing solar\nradiation, air temperature, and air dryness conditions. Potential evaporation\nis generally high over the Australian continent, significantly exceeding\nrainfall in all but the wettest areas. It is extreme (approaching 10mm/day) in\nthe northern inland in summer. It decreases with decreasing solar radiation,\nthat is with increasing southern latitude and in winter. Potential evaporation\nalso decreases with proximity to coasts, because of increasing cloudiness.\nActual evaporation is controlled by the various resistances to moisture loss\noffered by plants and soil. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation.EvapPT.00, EvapPT.01 a| EvapPT.12 a Mean\nannual and monthly potential evaporation (mm)Data is in albers equal area, and\nunprojected using GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ampe_r9cl\n__01512a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

Composting helps to reduce the amount of food waste we send to landfill, while also reducing the harmful greenhouse gases that are released. It’s also an easy way to experience where our food comes from and shows how valuable our food scraps can be in the cultivation and harvesting cycle.Brisbane’s Community composting hub program encourages residents living near a hub to regularly contribute their food scraps. With support from Council and community volunteer caretakers, residents can learn about the benefits of composting and other ways to reduce the amount of food waste they create.More information on compost and food waste recycling can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/clean-and-green/green-home-and-community/sustainable-gardening/compost-and-food-waste-recycling\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.",

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. \r\n\r\n A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\n The dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 presents the new NFI classification with three national forest categories, as reported by the NFI in  Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013  (SOFR 2013), and replaces the spatial dataset titled Forests of Australia (2013). The three national forest categories are: Native forest, Industrial plantations and Other forests. The 'Native forest' category has previously been reported by the NFI, however, 'Industrial plantations' and 'Other forests' are new categories for planted forests: 'Industrial plantations', for plantations managed commercially and reported through the National Plantation Inventory (NPI), and 'Other forest' for planted forest not managed commercially or otherwise not reported through the NPI. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's  National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS)  and the  Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) Act 2002.  The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1990. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

Core BAR 9403 was obtained in 1994 off the coast of Sumatra (5o49.20', 103o61.90'E By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information regarding past oceanographic and climatic systems. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile of the core (revealing sedimentation rates), the relative abundance of planktonic foraminifera over time, and estimates of historical sea-surface temperatures.",

    "description": "Rodrigues is located at latitude 19°43' S and longitude 63°25' E in the Southwest Indian Ocean and features the best developed reefs in the Mascarenes. \n\nIn 2001 a field expedition to Rodrigues recovered six drill cores using a portable hydraulic drilling rig. In all, two cores were recovered from the windward margin (cores 10 and 17), with a maximum depth of penetration of 4 m. Four cores were recovered from the leeward margin (8, 14, 15, 18) where the maximum depth penetration attained was 4.2 m. Recovery ranged from 23 to 63 %.\n\nThin sections were made and examined petrographically. Radiocarbon dating was performed on selected corals from the base of each core interpreted to have grown in situ and to be free from intraskeletal contamination.\n\nRadiometric dating suggests that Rodrigues reefs approached sea level between 3.1 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP and 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. In fact, the windward margin apparently grew to within 2.5 m of present day sea level by approximately 2.7 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. The leeward margin approached modern day sea level more recently between 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP and 2.4 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion for the top 4 m of the cores range from 0.46 - 1.96 m / kyr.",
