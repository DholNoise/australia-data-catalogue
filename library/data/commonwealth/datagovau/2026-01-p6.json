    "description": "SandMap Pty Ltd has been contracted by Moreton Bay Regional Council to undertake investigation surveys into multiple sites located close offshore from the Redcliffe Peninsula, QLD. These surveys will inform coastal modelling currently being undertaken as part of coastal design projects and may also be used to set-out coastal protection structures such as groyne extensions and seawalls encroaching below the low tide mark. \n\nThe survey requirements were to provide enough coverage within marked survey extents and high priority areas for each site to capture key bed features and the toe of any coastal structures up to -0.5m AHD. Additionally, the fringes of reefs within the marked areas were to be captured. To supplement this data, a number of survey profiles were specified for capture. The survey to be carried out to Class D requirements.\n\nThis site, Woody Point, refers to a 2.2km x 0.6km long section of coastline on the southern tip of the Redcliffe Peninsula and incorporates the Woody Point jetty. The survey area as identified through the specifications, including profiles, is contained within an area of 1.9km by 1.6km.",

The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\nGloucester Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input  and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.  The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of  equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. The surface water component of the zone was derived by selecting assessment units within 150m or sharing an alluvial floodplain with an impacted river reach.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing tweaks were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nA selection buffer of 300m was created from the potentially impacted reaches of the surface water modelling interpolated reaches polylines. This was unioned with polygons in the alluvium layer that intersected with the potentially impacted reaches to create the composite selection layer (included in component layer folder). The composite selection layer was manually edited to constrain the extent to that reasonably potentially influenced by changes in river. \n\n\n\nThe composite selection layer was used to select, by intersection, AUs that represented the surface water\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) GLO ZoPHC and component layers 20170217.

    "description": "We request 15 hours of observing time with the Parkes UWL receiver (700-4000 MHz) to investigate frequency-dependent eclipsing in three spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs): one redback and two black widows. Spider MSPs commonly exhibit frequency-dependent eclipsing, which provides insights into their dense, magnetized plasma environments. We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "Live release 1.0\r\n\r\nThis APS Career Pathfinder dataset contains the capability frameworks, role definitions and learning catalogues used by the [APS Career Pathfinder](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/aps-career-pathfinder-tool) tool to facilitate career exploration and development in the Australian Public Service (APS).\r\n\r\nThe role definitions include typical APS roles, which describe the skills and general capability requirements typically found in APS jobs based on those roles. You can use these definitions to determine potential career pathways and identify skills gaps and learning solutions that may help fill those gaps.\r\n\r\nThe focus at present is on digital roles, and therefore the capability frameworks, role definitions and the learning catalogue we are using primarily address digital, data and ICT. However, the APS Career Pathfinder tool has the capability to work with other types of capability framework, with roles and leaning mapped accordingly, so that it can support career exploration and development in potentially any area of capability.\r\n\r\nWe’ve defined roles according to skills drawn from capability frameworks, primarily [SFIA](https://sfia-online.org/en/), the Skills Framework for the Information Age. We use additional capability frameworks where relevant, including other skills frameworks (like [CIISec](https://www.ciisec.org/), the Chartered Institute of Information Security skills framework, and the [DCF](https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-data-capability-framework) Data Capability Framework), knowledge frameworks (like our simple knowledge magnitude scale), and behaviours (using the APS Work Level Standards). Additional details about roles include:\r\n\r\n* a brief description of each role or discipline\r\n* a mapping to the APS Job Family Model\r\n* a mapping to areas of interest\r\n* alternative names the roles may have\r\n* link to a ‘day in the life of’ profile for certain roles\r\n* relative role demand\r\n* link to learning solutions related to each role\r\n\r\nWe may define roles as typical APS roles, which are not specific to any agency, or as agency-specific roles. Agencies can include their role definitions in this dataset by sending their definitions to the contact email below.\r\n\r\nPlease send requests to change or augment any of this data to the contact email below. We may consult with our community before including them.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes the full SFIA framework, reproduced and made available through the [SFIA-AU](https://digitalprofession.gov.au/skills-framework-information-age) license. Use throughout Australia is permitted through this license, but may be restricted for foreign and multi-national organisations.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions. Various sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.",

The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. This dataset was produced from MODIS ETa images and Landsat images. The updated TERN AET dataset (see https://www.tern.org.au/news-australia-wide-aet-data/) has several key improvements implemented which means it supersedes the Landsat-MODIS blended AET developed for the GBA Program. The GBA AET data are still valid for use in analysis. This dataset contains a detailed metadata statement, including technical details regarding the original dataset.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset contains the Landsat-MODIS blended 8-day AET images for the Isa GBA region from Feb 2000 to Sep 2018. The main source datasets include 1) AET images derived from 8-day MODIS c6 product by CSIRO Land and Water, 2) Landsat reflectance images provided by GA Datacube on NCI.

    "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Synthesizing three decades of seagrass spatial data from Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait have globally significant seagrass habitat that provide food for threatened dugong and turtle, and habitat for commercially important fish and prawns. Key to understanding, managing, mitigating risk, and monitoring seagrass in this remote region is reliable data on seagrass distribution and species composition and how these changes through time. Data on seagrass has been collected in these areas since the 1980s, but data location and storage from these efforts remains disparate, in many cases not publicly available, and in some cases has already been lost. Our study will compile, validate and synthesize historical seagrass spatial data to create a publicly available database accessible on eAtlas. This product will provide end-users with a valuable spatial resource to assist management and monitoring of seagrass in the region. \n\n(i) Identify key seagrass habitat and migration corridors for dugong and turtles in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\n(ii) Identify regions where seagrass information is deficient (knowledge gaps)\n(iii) create a foundations for models assessing exposure to risk (water quality and other environmental impacts, climate change, etc)\n(iv) provide essential information for management, planning, and developing long-term monitoring plans\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • seagrass data [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC11) was collected from a depth of 502 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~30cm depth. From matching the 18O G. ruber curve with Martinson et al. (1987), 4 glacial cycles can be determined, incorporating Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 1 through to MIS 11. Isotopically heavier 18O values at ~460cm, ~345cm, 150cm, and 30cm correspond respectively to MIS 10, MIS 8, MIS 6 and the LGM. The d13C shows a trough lagging behind the 18O high during the glacial, although there are considerable fluctuations between MIS 8 and 6.",

    "description": "We request 15 hours of observing time with the Parkes UWL receiver (700-4000 MHz) to investigate frequency-dependent eclipsing in three spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs): one redback and two black widows. Spider MSPs commonly exhibit frequency-dependent eclipsing, which provides insights into their dense, magnetized plasma environments. We propose to use the Parkes telescope with the UWL receiver in full polar mode to investigate key properties of three spider MSPs, focusing on their eclipse mechanisms and polarization characteristics. Our goals include modeling the eclipse phase spectra using wideband observations to examine the transition from optically thick to thin regimes and exploring the underlying eclipse mechanisms. Additionally, we aim to study the polarization properties of these MSPs, which remain unexplored around 2 GHz, and also to investigate high-frequency eclipses similar to those observed in systems like J1908+2105. Such eclipses suggest the presence of dense and magnetized plasma environments, enabling more precise constraints on parameters like electron column density and magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, we plan to probe magnetic fields by observing potential changes in rotation measure (RM) at eclipse ingress and egress.",

    "description": "The Study Area\n\nThe study area comprises four sub-catchments within the Canterbury-Bankstown Council Local Government Area (LGA) that drain to Prospect Creek:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Georges Hall Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering approximately 145 hectares, this area predominantly features residential land with notable reserves, such as Crest Reserve and Garrison Point Reserve.</li>\n<li><strong>Lansdowne Sub-Catchment</strong>: Spanning 243 hectares, it includes residential areas alongside significant bushland and parklands, such as Lansdowne Park and Mirambeena Regional Park.</li>\n<li><strong>Miller Road Sub-Catchment</strong>: Covering 50 hectares, this area includes residential zones with no defined water channels, relying on overland flow paths and a piped drainage network.</li>\n<li><strong>Villawood Sub-Catchment</strong>: The largest at approximately 740 hectares, this area comprises residential and industrial zones with a network of concrete-lined open channels.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA map of the study area is shown in Figure 1-2.\n\nConsultation\n\nCommunity and stakeholder consultation has been integral to this project. Key consultation activities included:\n<ul>\n<li>Engagement with the Floodplain Management Committee throughout the project phases;</li>\n<li>Community feedback collected through online surveys, email submissions, and in-person sessions, with a total of 67 recorded responses during initial consultation;</li>\n<li>Public exhibition of the draft study and plan, incorporating input from 57 engagements; and</li>\n<li>Targeted discussions on identified issues, such as voluntary house raising and stormwater management concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n\nModelling of Flood Behaviour\n\nCanterbury-Bankstown Council has implemented a consistent and advanced approach for modelling stormwater catchment flooding. The methodology integrates a dynamically linked 2D/1D hydrodynamic model (TUFLOW), which simulates flood behaviours with precision.\n\nThe TUFLOW model uses a two-dimensional grid to represent surface terrain while incorporating one-dimensional elements for stormwater pipes and channels. Overflow from drainage elements is accounted for, allowing flows to spill onto the grid and replicate overland and sheet flows across floodplains.\n\nFlood Risk Mapping &amp; Development Controls\n\nFlood risk mapping for the Prospect Creek sub-catchments categorises the area into three flood risk precincts, guiding development controls:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Areas prone to significant flood damages and evacuation challenges, where development is generally restricted.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Zones with moderate risk, where damages can be mitigated with suitable controls.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Flood Risk Areas</strong>: Regions with minimal risk where most developments are permitted, subject to planning regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAdditionally, overland flow precincts have been identified to account for shallow inundation areas, enabling tailored development controls.\n\nThe Flood Problem\n\nA comprehensive flood damages database was developed to evaluate flood impacts and inform flood mitigation strategies. Key findings include:\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 2,667 properties are impacted in the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event, with over 60% located in the Villawood sub-catchment.</li>\n<li>Average Annual Damages (AAD) across the sub-catchments exceed $93.7 million, with the Villawood sub-catchment contributing a significant portion due to its low-lying industrial areas.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFlood mitigation measures were assessed, and recommendations for effective floodplain management have been outlined to address these challenges.",

The other HF ocean radar station is at Cape Wiles.  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. \n\nThe CSP HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with a 16-element receive array.  This radar operates at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 4.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 237 deg true east of north (approximately north by north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "A deposit of weathered graphic granite at White Rocks, 2 miles south of Queanbeyan, was investigated and the limits of material in it suitable for easily quarryable road metal were determined. The area was divided into two sections: a northern one held for the most part by the Queanbeyan Council, and a southern section at present held privately as a grazing lease. \"Indicated\" reserves, based on the present quarrying level, of 170,000 cub. yds were established in the northern section. Most of this material will be of the same quality as that being quarried at present; some of the material towards the southern boundary of the lease will however be harder and require more blasting. In the grazing leases \"inferred reserves\" of 140,000 cub. yds. were delineated. It is expected that this material will be quite suitable for road making but may be slightly inferior in sizing to the material at present being quarried; also it may require more blasting in some portions than the material being quarried at present; it will carry a higher average overburden than the Queanbeyan lease.",

    "description": "Geoscape G-NAF is the geocoded address database for Australian businesses and governments. It’s the trusted source of geocoded address data for Australia with over 50 million contributed addresses distilled into 15.4 million G-NAF addresses. It is built and maintained by [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using independently examined and validated government data. \r\n\r\nFrom 22 August 2022, Geoscape Australia is making G-NAF available in an additional simplified table format. [G-NAF Core](https://geoscape.com.au/data/g-naf-core/?utm_source=DISER&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=data.gov.au&utm_content=download+data&utm_campaign=G-NAF+core) makes accessing geocoded addresses easier by utilising less technical effort.\r\n\r\nG-NAF Core will be updated on a quarterly basis along with G-NAF.\r\n\r\nFurther information about contributors to G-NAF is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nWith more than 15 million Australian physical address record, G-NAF is one of the most ubiquitous and powerful spatial datasets. The records include geocodes, which are latitude and longitude map coordinates. G-NAF does not contain personal information or details relating to individuals.\r\n\r\nUpdated versions of G-NAF are published on a quarterly basis. Previous versions are available [here](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geoscape-geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf-previous-versions)\r\n\r\nUsers have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing either GDA94 or GDA2020 datums.\r\n\r\n**Changes in the November 2025 release**\r\n\r\n* Nationally, the November 2025 update of G-NAF shows an increase of 32,773 addresses overall (0.21%). The total number of addresses in G-NAF now stands at 15,827,416 of which 14,983,358 or 94.67% are principal. \r\n\r\n* There is one new locality for the November 2025 Release of G-NAF, the locality of Southwark in South Australia. \r\n\r\n* Geoscape has moved product descriptions, guides and reports online to https://docs.geoscape.com.au.\r\n\r\nFurther information on G-NAF, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/g-naf) or through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on G-NAF, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: On 1 October 2020, PSMA Australia Limited began trading as Geoscape Australia.\r\n\r\n##License Information\r\n\r\n[Use of the G-NAF downloaded from data.gov.au is subject to the End User Licence Agreement (EULA)](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf/resource/09f74802-08b1-4214-a6ea-3591b2753d30)\r\n\r\nThe EULA terms are based on the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the Corangamite CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the measurement of Secchi Depth and Total suspended solids (inorganic and organic components) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling.\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "The Fishermans Bend groundwater studies were conducted between 2015 and 2017, across the five precincts of Fishermans Bend, as part of the proposed redevelopment. The studies focused on confirming the depth of groundwater and the regional groundwater quality. The studies aimed to understand the regional groundwater quality, and therefore did not focus on specific sources of contamination. Some contamination was identified that will need further assessment through the audit system or as part of EPA’s regulatory role as development proceeds.\nThe data provided here is contained within the technical reports at www.epa.vic.gov.au/fishermansbend. The data set includes:\n- field physical measurements (standing water level (m from Top of Casing, mAHD), time, date)\n- field chemical measurements (pH, electrolytic conductivity (µS/cm), reduction-oxidation potential (mV), temperature (°C), dissolved oxygen (mg/L))\n- groundwater laboratory analytical results (raw results only. QA/QC data, such as blanks, trips, spikes, surrogates and duplicates can be viewed in the technical reports)\n- soil laboratory analytical results from the installation of monitoring wells in 2015 and 2016 (raw results only)\n- spatial coordinates (eastings, northings, GDA94)\n- registered bore licence numbers (i.e. bore_id) where available.\nThis data is also available through DELWP's Water Management Information System (WMIS).\nEPA Victoria will continue to be the custodians of the data; including provisioning access to these wells for sampling by interested parties, and the collation of field and laboratory results from sampling by interested parties.",

    "description": "Based on Landgate’s high resolution aerial imagery, CSIRO generate the Urban Monitor mosaic from which vegetation height strata of endemic and exotic species has been calculated and reported as an area for each height strata of 0 – 3 m, 3 – 8 m, 8 – 15 m and 15+ m. The area of grass covered areas falling into the 0 – 50 cm range has also been calculated and recorded in square metres. Vegetation coverage greater than 3 metres in height has been deemed tree canopy. The canopies have been aggregated and reported as total canopy coverage in square metres. Urban Forest Mesh Blocks have been published for the following years: 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018.\n\nParcels to be analysed were sourced from the 2016 Integrated Land Information Database (ILID) and supplied to CSIRO by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. The results were assembled into Urban Forest features where the Urban Monitor coverage was complete.\n\nLand parcels were assigned locational data (2016 ABS meshblocks, suburbs, local government authority (LGA) and planning sub-region) based on the parcel centroid. They were then attributed with the following land use categories: • Street Block: residential, commercial, industrial, hospital/medical, educational, and some agricultural and transport land uses • Parks: public parks, open space, private recreation grounds and State Forest • Roads: roads including road reserves • Other Infrastructure: rail, airports and utilities infrastructure • Other: land uses in transition that have not progressed sufficiently to be Street Blocks or do not conform to urban form • Rural: primary production land that does not fall in categories above • Water: ocean and other waterways, including reservoirs\n\nThe vegetation height strata areas and total canopy coverage values were calculated for each land parcel. The statistics were then aggregated by the field MB_MonitorCategory, a concatenation of the fields MB_CODE16 and MonitorCategory. Canopy coverage percentages and ranges were calculated based on the sum of the area of parcels within each MB_MonitoryCategory. As parcels with sufficient Urban Monitor coverage for Urban Forest analysis may vary between years making comparison difficult, a field called MBPercentage was added which shows the percentage of the total MB_MonitorCategory area (MBArea) covered by parcels with Urban Forest values for that year. Corresponding MBPercentage values for all published years were also added to inform users.\n\nNOTE: As mesh block attributes were assigned based on parcel centroid, aggregated mesh block boundaries based on the parcels may not match ABS mesh block boundaries, and MBAreas will not match ABS mesh block areas.

It includes observations of lichens growing on nunataks for which the time of deglaciation is known and observations of lichens growing on supraglacial moraine ridges for which the time of formation is not known. This dataset thus provides the basis for a relative chronology of moraine development based on the assumption that the growth of the lichen thallus has been constant since the time of deglaciation.\n\n      \n\nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2010_V09.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, NSW, Oct 14, 2010\nArrived:  \tSydney, NSW, Oct 31, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This record describes the Wildlife on Voyage (WoV) data collected on Investigator voyage IN2023_V02, titled: \"Gigantic submarine landslide offshore western Tasmania: risk mitigation for shelf-derived tsunami in Australia.\" The voyage took place between March 24, 2023 and April 30, 2023 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart.\nThese surveys were conducted alongside Marine Mammal Observer (MMO) duties associated with seismic operations. There were two survey protocols: Continuous (which were performed when seismic operations required MMOs on watch for the entire survey period); and structured snapshots.\nThe collected data were processed (quality-controlled), and subsequently archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).\nPlease note: besides marine mammals and seabirds, the dataset also includes a few tuna and shark observations.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset may be found in the data package README file and the associated publication:\nViola, B., Puskic, P., Corney, S. et al.

    "description": "This data was collected in May 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T01.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, \t   TAS, May 04, 2011\nArrived:   \tBrisbane, QLD, May 12, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This study investigated the influence of predation on the distribution of shrimp in Western Port Bay from July 1977 to January 1980. Predation by birds was determined by analysing the diets and feeding rates of the most abundant wading birds in the area, the Royal Spoonbill (Platalea regia), the White-faced Heron (Ardea novaehollandiae), and the Sacred Ibis (Threskiornis aethiopica). Predation by fish was determined by examining the gut contents of fish caught in the beam trawls. The shrimps found in the gut contents were identified and, where possible, sexed and carapace length measured. \n\nThis study found that the major consumers of shrimps were the scorpaenid, Gymnapistes marmoratus (Australian Cobbler) and the short-headed worm-eel, Muraenichthys breviceps. The Royal Spoonbill feed almost solely on M.intermdieum, whereas the other 2 species of waders feed mostly on infauna. The larger-sized individuals, which tend to be females, are subject so higher predation pressure than other groups within species.",

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

Over 6000 m of sediment is interpreted in the deepest pockets.\n\nThe tools developed to realise the 3D gravity modelling are described in some detail. The gravity modelling process is also presented with a view to easing the integration of 3D mapping methods with a traditional reflection seismic interpretation workflow in the marine sedimentary basin environment.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe Steedman EMS-16 Meteorological Station housing an R.M. Young anemometer and YSI barometer was set up near Governor Head, Jervis Bay (35.133S, 150.762E). The site was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nBetween 3nd Nov 1989 and 24th September 1991 the station recorded wind velocity, direction (E/W and N/S components) and atmospheric pressure. \n\nThe Meteorological Station recorded 15 minute vector averages of the wind velocity and 15 minute values of air pressure. Data is presented in the oceanographic format i.e. 'direction going to'. The datasets titled 'Additional meteorological data' provide information on the average wind speed and direction, as well as the maximum gusts.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This data was collected in December 2012 - January 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213V2.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, December 20, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  January 08, 2013\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "The operational map for Coastal Saltmarsh was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. The project’s Threatened Ecological Community Reference Panel (the Panel) reviewed the determination for Coastal Saltmarsh and agreed upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification. \nWe identified that any treeless saline and sub saline native vegetation found in the intertidal zone had the potential to be Coastal Saltmarsh. We estimated the extent of the intertidal zone by using a fine scale digital elevation model to determine the highest astronomical tideline (HAT). We then mapped potential Coastal Saltmarsh by analysing recent fine scale three dimensional aerial imagery to identify any native vegetation that comprised of low-growing treeless communities and was located within the HAT and on the landward side of mangroves. Mapping criteria used a tree cover tolerance of up to 30% to include areas that had a mixed cover of mangrove, paperbark or casuarina species with a saltmarsh understorey. Exposed mudflats and banks were also mapped when they were visible.\nOur mapping covered 1.4 million hectares of State Forest within the south, central and north coast regions of NSW. We identified a total of 111.9 hectares of Coastal Saltmarsh within 14 State Forests along the east coast. The most extensive areas are located in Bermagui and Mogo State Forests on the south coast and in Wallaroo State Forests on the north coast. \nWe validated our map of coastal saltmarsh using an existing independent map of estuarine habitats (Creese et al 2009). Our mapping consistently identified almost twice as much coastal saltmarsh as Creese et al (2009), but this was attributable to differences in the mapping criteria rather than any error.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "Data and charts for figures of CSIRO's 'Modelling Sectoral Technology and Emissions Pathways to 2035 and Net Zero Emissions - Final Report'\n\nTo assist the Australian Government in developing a national net zero emissions by 2050 plan, the parliament requested that the Climate Change Authority undertake a review of the potential technology transition and emissions pathways in six sectors – electricity and energy, industry and resources, transport, land and agriculture, waste, and the built environment.\n\nThe six modelling scenarios analysed in this report were designed by the authority in consultation with CSIRO. The modelling undertaken by CSIRO examined six scenarios reflecting four levels of domestic decarbonisation ambition (A50, A45, A40, A35) with net-zero years ranging from 2050 to 2035, each with a corresponding level of emissions in 2035 as indicated in Table 1. The domestic scenarios were modelled under different global climate ambition settings of 2°C and 1.5°C (G2 and G1.5) to explore the macroeconomic, sectoral and environmental impact for Australia with different combinations of domestic and global ambition. Two additional sensitivity scenarios were modelled to investigate the impact of lower renewable uptake and are implemented as an upper limit (the “+RL” or “+Renewable Limit” scenarios).",

Projections have been released four times, beginning with\nVictoria in Future 1997. The data provide an insight into the likely future\nsize, location and structure of our population, as well as components of\npopulation change (births, deaths, migration) and the way we form households,\ngiven assumptions about the continuation of current societal, economic and\ndemographic trends. Victoria in Future data is used widely within state\ngovernment, as well as the private and community sectors. The data are used to\nunderstand the population as it stands and as it is likely to be, and is used\nmost often in the strategic planning for businesses and organisations\nincluding, but not limited to: land use and development, health and community\nservices, transport, justice, retail and commercial, water, energy and\ninfrastructure.\n\n",

    "description": "Based on Landgate’s high resolution aerial imagery, CSIRO generate the Urban Monitor mosaic from which vegetation height strata of endemic and exotic species has been calculated and reported as an area for each height strata of 0 – 3 m, 3 – 8 m, 8 – 15 m and 15+ m. The area of grass covered areas falling into the 0 – 50 cm range has also been calculated and recorded in square metres. Vegetation coverage greater than 3 metres in height has been deemed tree canopy. The canopies have been aggregated and reported as total canopy coverage in square metres. Urban Forest Mesh Blocks have been published for the following years: 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2024.\n\nParcels to be analysed were sourced from the 2024 Integrated Land Information Database (ILID) and supplied to CSIRO by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. The results were assembled into Urban Forest features where the Urban Monitor coverage was complete.\n\nLand parcels were assigned locational data (2021 ABS meshblocks, suburbs, local government authority (LGA) and planning sub-region) based on the parcel centroid. They were then attributed with the following land use categories: • Street Block: residential, commercial, industrial, hospital/medical, educational, and some agricultural and transport land uses • Parks: public parks, open space, private recreation grounds and State Forest • Roads: roads including road reserves • Other Infrastructure: rail, airports and utilities infrastructure • Other: land uses in transition that have not progressed sufficiently to be Street Blocks or do not conform to urban form • Rural: primary production land that does not fall in categories above • Water: ocean and other waterways, including reservoirs\n\nThe vegetation height strata areas and total canopy coverage values were calculated for each land parcel. The statistics were then aggregated by the field MB_MonitorCategory, a concatenation of the fields MB_CODE2021 and MonitorCategory. Canopy coverage percentages and ranges were calculated based on the sum of the area of parcels within each MB_MonitoryCategory. As parcels with sufficient Urban Monitor coverage for Urban Forest analysis may vary between years making comparison difficult, a field called MBPercentage was added which shows the percentage of the total MB_MonitorCategory area (MBArea) covered by parcels with Urban Forest values for that year. Corresponding MBPercentage values for all published years were also added to inform users.\n\nNOTE: As mesh block attributes were assigned based on parcel centroid, aggregated mesh block boundaries based on the parcels may not match ABS mesh block boundaries, and MBAreas will not match ABS mesh block areas.",

This specific dataset presents statistics on affordable rental properties by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nAffordable rental properties are those within 30 per cent of gross income for low-income households. The rental thresholds are taken from the household incomes for whom that number of bedrooms is a minimum: \n\n\nFor one-bedroom properties, we have taken the income of singles on Newstart allowance;\n\n\nFor two-bedroom properties, we have taken a single parent pensioner with one child aged under 5;\n\n\nFor three-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with two children;\n\n\nFor four-bedroom properties, we have taken a couple on Newstart with four children.\n\n\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

Woehler\n\nMovie and aerial photography were undertaken during the 87/88 visit.\n\nAERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nThe aerial photography was limited to two days, concurrent with the resupply visit by MV Nella Dan during Voyage 2, 18 and 19 October 1987.\n\nA Linhoff camera was mounted in one (HRK) of the two Hughes 500D helicopters on board and two 100 metre rolls of 70mm film were exposed. The first roll was exposed at Spit Island and North and South Spit on 18 October.  The second roll was exposed around the Four Bays region, Saddle Point, Hoseason Beach and the archaeological site at Sealers Corner, Corinthian Bay on 19 October. Details of each roll are given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.  Details of aerial photography (M = magnetic)\n\nExposures Height Bearing Subject\n\nRoll 1  18 October 1987\n\n001-050 300' 130 degrees M Spit Island (harems)\n\n051-102 300' 310 degrees Spit Island (harems)\n\n103-139 300' 120 degrees Spit Island (harems)\n\n140-175 300' 310 degrees Spit Island (harems)\n\n176-252 500' 310 degrees Spit Point towards Dovers Moraine (South Spit)\n\n253-303 400'-500' 300 degrees Spit Point towards Spit Camp (North Spit)\n\nRoll 2   19 October 1987\n\n020-117 040'-700' 330 degrees M Archaeological site, Sealers Corner Corinthian Bay rising from 040' to 700' (Exp 070) then down to 500-550'\n\n118-124 200' Seal harems on Walrus Beach, Atlas Cove.\n\n125-132 250' Flight path following coastline.

Photography of the harems on North and South Spit and the Four Bays region provided the opportunity of verifying ground counts made on the same day. All exposures were made at approximately 60 knots ground-speed.  Flying heights were generally confined to below 350' at Atlas Cove by a low cloud cover and to 500' at Spit by strong winds at higher altitudes.\n\nFlight lines and photo centres representing the Roll 1 aerial photography (Film ANTC1082) are included in the aerial photography data available for download (see provided URL) and have Qinfo = 760. The flight lines and photo centres are provided as shapefiles and Qinfo is an attribute of the shapefiles. \n\nSee the Quality field for comments about the flight lines and photo centres.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) has prints of some Roll 1 frames. They were stitched together, and glued to a presentation board but have since been separated from the board and stored in an archival box. Print = Y in the attribute table of the photo centres shapefile indicates there is a print for that frame. The prints are not available for loan outside the AAD. \n\nContact the Australian Antarctic Data Centre for access to the prints:\n\nhttp://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/requests/request.cfm",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n As part of a three year (2015-16 to 2017-18) joint project between Forest and Wood Products Australia (FWPA) and ABARES, ABARES developed quarterly sales volume forecasts for selected wood products from the FWPA Softwood Data series. This technical report documents the methods and assumption underlying ABARES forecasts. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The FWPA Softwood Data Series (FWPA 2016) was established in 2002 by Australia's major softwood sawmilling companies and provides monthly sales volumes for 44 detailed product categories. ABARES was tasked to estimate quarterly forecasts for four specific wood products; untreated structural pine less than 120mm, untreated structural pine greater than 120mm, termite treated structural pine and landscape wood products. These forecasts will be made available for members of the FWPA data dashboard. \r\n\r\n\r\n• The econometric models estimated in the report are not based on formal structural economic models of the relevant wood product markets. Instead, they are simple, statistically robust, predictive models that are based on historical relationships and patterns observed over the sample period. \r\n\r\n\r\n• In interpreting or using ABARES forecasts it should be noted, that the FWPA Softwood Data series do not include all producers in the industry and the number of participating producers is changing over time. As such, the series are not representative of national production or sales and the effects of new entrants in the data series has the potential to affect the validity of the estimated models. The models estimated in this study, and approaches used to generate forecasts, will be periodically reviewed by ABARES in order to improve the accuracy of forecasts over time. \r\n",

    "description": "The EAC1 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.31 S, 153.98 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015. \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes 75kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (Long Ranger ADCPs), Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south\n2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Australian Commonwealth fisheries are managed with the objective of maximising economic returns to the Australian community - an objective that may be served by increasing the efficiency of the fishing fleet. This paper presents a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. ABARES used boat-level data to explore the potential of the SFA approach to determine the efficiency of the fleet and find reasons for any inefficiencies. \r\n\r\n This preliminary work: • indicates significant inefficiency in the CTS fleet \r\n• provides some support for the hypothesis that a structural adjustment in 2006 resulted in less efficient boats leaving the fishery, which led to improved economic returns \r\n• shows that interannual effects, such as stock availability, management changes and technical change, play a large role in the estimated frontier and must be disentangled from each other in further work to provide more information for managers.\r\n",

Janas (IMOS platform code: ZMTW).\n\nDeparted:  Southern Ocean, August 21, 2009\nArrived:  \tHobart, Australia, August 25, 2009\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

This methodology assists Aerometrex to produce a seamless geo-referenced orthophotography product.\nTile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km GeoTIFF Tiles\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "The EAC2 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.30 S, 154.03 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015. \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs): Long Ranger, Sentinel 300 and Quartermaster, Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south\n2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

It is best suited to the 350-600 mm rainfall zone where most extensive crops are grown (i.e. the wheatbelt), though may be extended to include some slightly higher rainfall areas. Crops included in this general assessment are wheat, barley, oats, narrow-leafed lupins, field peas, canola, chickpea and faba beans.\n\nLand capability refers to the ability of land to support a type of land use without causing damage. See DAFWA Resource Management Technical Report 298 for a description of the qualities assessed and the methodology involved.\n\nCapability ratings do not take into account factors such as the availability and quality of water supplies for irrigation or climatic risks such as frost or heat stress. Such factors need to be considered as a separate layer of information.",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) Southern Surveyor collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 3-hourly. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2026 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

    "description": "This data was collected in September - November 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213VMS.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, September 14, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  November 16, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Hobart) with SA2 code (61027).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Hobart SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

Modelled on the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report [In]Sight was developed in collaboration with Deloitte Access Economics and combines data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Social Health Atlas of Australia.\nInfrastructure and transport (and by extension essential services) are crucial elements in determining the location of and type of investment activities and business sectors that can develop in a region.\nWell-developed infrastructure particularly dependable electricity and telecommunications systems are an integral component of business production. Similarly effective transport systems are vital in allowing regions to move their goods and services in a secure and timely fashion. Both of these measures directly influence a region's competitiveness as they improve the region's ability to host economic activities through adequate infrastructure and also increase the region's ability to interact with other markets.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a21.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

This study used two refined attributes for identifying wilderness quality: modern industrial levels and habitat area, quality and fragmentation.\n\nThe outputs of this study include a technical report, spatial datasets (including a metadata file), and a map of the state.

It was provided by to Geoscience by Christmas Island National Park staff in July 2012 as a shapefile.\nThe only changes made to the data were to move eight grid points to line up with the orthophotography.  For these edited points, the ‘x’ and ‘y’ fields were updated using the Field Calculator in Quantum GIS.  Attributes include; road name, fence name, type of infrastructure and x and y coordinates.\nPositional accuracy is high as the layer was based on the 2011 orthophotography.  However, crab barrier placement may be subject to change.  This data has not been updated since 2012.\nDisclaimer",

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "CSIRO Biodiversity Habitat Index (BHI v2) is a global 30 arc-second product for 2000,2005,2010,2015 and 2020. BHI estimates the level of species diversity expected to be retained within any given spatial reporting unit (e.g., a country, a broad ecosystem type, or the entire planet) as a function of the unit’s area, connectivity and integrity of natural ecosystems across it. Results for the indicator can either be expressed as 1) the ‘effective proportion of habitat’ remaining within the unit – adjusting for the effects of the condition and functional connectivity of habitat, and of spatial variation in the species composition of ecological communities (beta diversity); or 2) the effective proportion of habitat that can be translated, through standard species-area analysis, into a prediction of the proportion of species expected to persist (i.e. avoid extinction) over the long term.       \n\nThe BHI is used to monitor and report past-to-present trends in the expected persistence of species diversity by repeatedly recalculating the indicator using best-available mapping of ecosystem condition or integrity observed at multiple points in time, e.g., for different years. A wide variety of data sources can be used for this purpose, spanning spatial scales from global to subnational, and including data assembled by countries for deriving ecosystem condition accounts under the UN SEEA Ecosystem Accounting framework. The BHI can also serve as a leading indicator for assessing the contribution that proposed or implemented area-based actions are expected to make towards enhancing the present capacity of ecosystems to retain species diversity, thereby providing a foundation for strategic prioritisation of such actions by countries.\n\nAggregation of the raw data for reporting by a region (country, ecoregion etc.) should follow the procedure in the folder \" Calculating weighted geometric means of CSIRO BILBI indicators for a region\"",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains the data and scripts to generate the hydrological response variables for surface water in the Clarence Moreton subregion as reported in CLM261 (Gilfedder et al. 2016).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nFile CLM_AWRA_HRVs_flowchart.png shows the different files in this dataset and how they interact. The python and R-scripts are written by the BA modelling team to, as detailed below, read, combine and analyse the source datasets CLM AWRA model, CLM groundwater model V1 and CLM16swg Surface water gauging station data within the Clarence Moreton Basin to create the hydrological response variables for surface water as reported in CLM2.6.1 (Gilfedder et al. 2016).\n\n\n\nR-script HRV_SWGW_CLM.R reads, for each model simulation, the outputs from the surface water model in netcdf format from file Qtot.nc (dataset CLM AWRA model) and the outputs from the groundwater model, flux_change.csv (dataset CLM groundwater model V1) and creates a set of files in subfolder /Output for each GaugeNr and simulation Year:\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_all.csv and CLM_GaugeNR_Year_baseline.csv: the set of 9 HRVs for GaugeNr and Year for all 5000 simulations for baseline conditions\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_CRDP.csv: the set of 9 HRVs for GaugeNr and Year for all 5000 simulations for CRDP conditions (=AWRA streamflow - MODFLOW change in SW-GW flux)\n\nCLM_GaugeNr_Year_minMax.csv: minimum and maximum of HRVs over all 5000 simulations\n\n\n\nPython script CLM_collate_DoE_Predictions.py collates that information into following files, for each HRV and each maxtype (absolute maximum (amax), relative maximum (pmax) and time of absolute maximum change (tmax)):\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_maxtyp_DoE_Predictions: for each simulation and each gauge_nr, the maxtyp of the HRV over the prediction period (2012 to 2102)\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_DoE_Observations: for each simulation and each gauge_nr, the HRV for the years that observations are available\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_Observations: summary statistics of each HRV and the observed value (based on data set CLM16swg Surface water gauging station data within the Clarence Moreton Basin)\n\nCLM_AWRA_HRV_maxtyp_Predictions: summary statistics of each HRV\n\n\n\nR-script CLM_CreateObjectiveFunction.R calculates for each HRV the objective function value for all simulations and stores it in CLM_AWRA_HRV_ss.csv. This file is used by python script CLM_AWRA_SI.py to generate figure CLM-2615-002-SI.png (sensitivity indices).\n\n\n\nThe AWRA objective function is combined with the overall objective function from the groundwater model in dataset CLM Modflow Uncertainty Analysis (CLM_MF_DoE_ObjFun.csv) into csv file CLM_AWRA_HRV_oo.csv. This file is used to select behavioural simulations in python script CLM-2615-001-top10.py. This script uses files CLM_NodeOrder.csv and BA_Visualisation.py to create the figures CLM-2616-001-HRV_10pct.png.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) CLM AWRA HRVs Uncertainty Analysis.
