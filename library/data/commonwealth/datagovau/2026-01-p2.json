    "title": "Mammals Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The collection took place in March 2020 when school operations were severely impacted by COVID-19, so the department did not follow up potential errors in class size or class structure with numerous schools.\n\n\nThe 2024 class size factsheet with state level aggregate data has been published and is available here:  https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/nsw-education-average-government-primary-school-class-sizes-by-school-size\n\n\nMulti-age classes are often designed to match the organisation of the syllabus, which is based on ‘stages’ running over two years.\n\n\nFrom 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.\n\n\nHistorical data displays the data that was correct in that year.\n\n\nResearch suggests that:\n\n\nClass organisation \"...will not determine either educational advantage or disadvantage...\" (NSW DET 1997).\n\n\nThe most important factors in determining student success are the quality of the teacher and his or her teaching.

    "description": "Ambulance Victoria has two official response time targets: Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 85% of incidents state-wide, and Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 90% of incidents in urban centres with populations greater than 7,500. Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective delivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are influenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1\", and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\" response. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time performance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics Urban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population. Ambulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population exceeds 7,500 persons.",

Within each region four sites were sampled seasonally over two years (total of 8 sampling occasions). At each site, sampling of fish was conducted using seine nets with length and weight of all collected fish measured. In addition, water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen were measured at each site.   The aim of the study is to develop cost-effective strategies for monitoring the fish community.\n\nData is still being collected / processed and will be released at the end of WAMSI program.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises catch compositions and trawl locations from a cruise of the Russian fishery research vessel \"Alba\" carried out in Australian waters in September 1970, containing 29 demersal trawls from Bass Strait and Great Australian Bight. Most records include catch composition by species (presence/absence but not weight), also some data on length frequency, maturity and diet of commercially important species. The data were obtained by exchange with Soviet scientists in the mid 1990s and has had CSIRO species codes incorporated. The dataset is now in an Oracle database in Hobart, and analyses/summaries of the data are given in the accompanying report (see References). A MS Access version of the dataset has been compiled for use within the North West Shelf-JEMS study. This version is available on-line for researchers in the NWS-JEMS study (see data links). The data are also accessible to authorised users via CMR's \"Data Trawler\" application. A username and password is required to access this dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for single sex schools in Victoria for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

However, from time to time,\nincidents do affect schools just as they affect communities and\nsociety as a whole. This publication provides information on incident reports in NSW government schools. Publishing these reports informs the community about incidents in public schools and how the department supports schools through incidents while still protecting the identity of students and staff.\nData Notes:\n\n\nFollowing an incident, the Principal or School Executive is required to notify the department’s Incident Report and Support Hotline which includes seconded NSW Police officers so support and advice can be provided to assist the school with the management of the incident. All criminal related incidents are reviewed by the seconded police officers in line with legislative requirements. In some circumstances the Principal or School Executive may also contact NSW Police directly if an urgent response is required.\n\n\nReferences have been removed which could expose a person to a risk of harm or which reveals the identities, or the personal/health information of students, school staff and community members. Information that may prejudice an investigation has also been removed.\n\n\nThe categories of incidents that are reported by schools include drugs, technology, violence, weapons and welfare.\n\n\nData is published biannually in January and October.\n\n\nMore information:\n\n\nRefer to the individual publications for further information and policy context.\n\n\nNSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) crime maps\n\n\nData Source:\n\nPeople Group.

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Residential Population (ERP) data by 5-year age groups and sex for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for Local Government Areas (LGA) and VIFSAs for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nsmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them\n\n\nlarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level\n\n\nas far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘vh_vuln_line.shp’ contains line data indicating the approximate boundary of the freshwater aquifer that is of very high risk of contamination and over extraction.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behavior on the island. The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the very high vulnerability boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

As a result CFA, Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) developed a proposal to align fire weather districts, TFB boundaries and Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries.\nAfter much consultation and amendments, it was agreed to approve the above proposal with the exception of Yarriambiack Shire which was divided using the east-west rabbit fence. The result created a total of 9 TFB Districts. These changes were implemented in October 2010.",

The data is an\r\nupdate of that presented in the _APS Statistical Bulletin 2010-11. _Data will\r\nnow be available at six monthly intervals -A through this summary for\r\ncalendar year data, and through the annual State of the Service Report (SOSR)\r\nand APS Statistical Bulletin (the Bulletin) for more detailed financial year\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nThe data in these tables is sourced from the APS Employment Database (APSED),\r\nwhich contains data extracted from agencies-C/ HR systems. The Australian\r\nPublic Service Commission continues to work with agencies to improve the\r\nquality and timeliness of the data they provide to APSED. Each year extensive\r\naudits and error checking of APSED are undertaken, to ensure that sound\r\nconclusions can be drawn from the data. Through this audit process, previously\r\npublished data has been updated. The June 2011 data published in SOSR and the\r\nBulletin has been revised.\r\n\r\nAs in the Bulletin, a headcount approach is used in these tables-that is,\r\npeople working part-time are aggregated with people working full-time without\r\nweighting. Data also includes inoperative staff. Employees-C/\r\nclassification in these tables refers to their base or substantive\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations used in these tables and changes to administrative arrangements\r\nfor the period July to December 2011 are explained below. The Explanatory\r\nNotes at Appendix 1 of the Bulletin provide definitions of terms used in these\r\ntables.

    "description": "PSR J1227-6208 is a recycled pulsar in a binary with a massive white dwarf companion. A recent timing measurement from combined MeerKAT and Parkes observations shows the companion mass to be between 1.2 and 1.5 solar masses, very close to the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in potentially profound physical implications. However, the timing precision is limited by the DM timing noise. We propose regular monitoring of this pulsar with the Parkes UWL receiver in conjunction with MeerKAT observations during the following four years. The joint monitoring will significantly improve the constraints on the Post-Keplerian parameters, with Parkes observations contributing to constrain the DM noise due to its large frequency bandwidth. These observations will be added to the already existing 11-year-long timing baseline, of which the later 5 years already include high-precision MeerKAT data and Parkes UWL data. After four years of further timing with the inclusion of UWL observations, we predict an uncertainty on the masses smaller than 0.01 solar masses based on simulations. If UWL is not included, the mass uncertainties may not improve beyond their current values.",

    "description": "The ISC2010_STRUCTURE1_S table is the Statistical Summary table for the Structure1 Metric at the 100m Section level. Structure 1 represents Vegetation Cover for two grouped height categories: Shrubs which are defined as vegetation in the height range 1.5m to 5m and Trees which are defined as vegetation with height greater than 5m.\n\nThe ISC2010_STRUCTURE1_S table is designed to JOIN to the ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINES_S feature class.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for March 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The data spans the months of 2013 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "Variations in microfossil records in sediments over time are used as proxies for changes in the ocean. One important record determined from microfossils is sea-ice cover which influences, and is influenced by, wind and ocean circulation, atmospheric conditions, and heat balance. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the predictive capabilities diatoms may bear in estimating Antarctic sea-ice, one of the important modulators of Southern Hemisphere climate. The purpose of this study was to estimate past sea-ice concentration and annual coverage at the site of core MD88-787 in the Southeast Indian Ocean. The accumulation of diatom microplankton assemblages in sediments being the proxy for these records of climatic change. \n\nA new method for sea-ice concentration and cover estimation from CABFAC derived factor analysis was developed during this project. Previous estimations of sea-ice have relied on other avenues of deriving limits to the maximum sea-ice edge, while the model developed here made use of modern sea-ice satellite observations combined with diatom distributions that are considered more closely linked to the sea-ice cover.\n\nThree models were proposed which estimated sea-ice concentration in February and September, and annual sea-ice cover.",

    "description": "The Perth Canyon Passive Acoustic Observatory consists of two to four moorings fitted with hydrophones set on the seabed at 400-490 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of: \n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and \n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian). \n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",

The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "This dataset contains information about children that are vulnerable on two or more domains of the Australian Early Development Censuses (AEDC) from 2009 - 2018. The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem (SA3 code 70203) and East Arnhem (SA3 code 70204) are combined in the original data. AURIN has assigned the results for these regions to the boundary of Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem and excluded the boundary of East Arnhem from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "Regional land supply assessments measure the stocks of land for future residential, industrial and commercial uses. It provides context for the land use planning and infrastructure provision required to meet demand across selected regional centres in Western Australia. Regional land supply assessments are prepared by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage (the Department) on behalf of the Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC) to fulfil the requirements for tracking and monitoring land supply, as outlined in section 14 of the Planning and Development Act 2005. The role of WAPC include monitoring and forecasting land supply throughout Western Australia, developing strategies for the timely supply of affordable residential land, and researching and developing planning methods and models relating to land use planning, land development and associated matters. \n\nRegional land supply assessments are one of a suite of products produced as part of the Urban Development Program (UDP). The UDP monitors land supply and promotes the timely delivery of residential, industrial and commercial land in Western Australia. The information presented in regional land supply assessments assist State Government agencies, utility and essential service providers, local governments and the private sector in decision making and forward planning. \n\nRegional land supply assessments include key information on:\n•   demand drivers specific to each regional centre, including the major economic factors that influence employment and population growth, and therefore, the demand for land and housing\n•   zoned land supply for residential (including rural living), industrial and commercial uses\n•   development constraints\n•   recent and future land development activity\n•   existing and required physical infrastructure. \n\nThis spatial dataset shows sites/areas that have been identified for future residential, industrial or commercial development. Sites are included where intent has been demonstrated by Government or the development industry to develop the site at some point in the future. Sites are included based on the current, applicable planning framework at the time of capture/analysis. ",

    "description": "This dataset contains cycling volume, movement flow and demographic data for the 'Super Tuesday' Commuter Bike Count event in September 2015. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were visually undertaken by volunteers. The data covers 47 Local Government Areas (LGAs) across ACT, NSW, SA, TAS, VIC and WA.\n'Super Tuesday' is Australia's largest visual bike count, where volunteer counters observe and record cyclist numbers across Australia. The Bicycle Network data is collected within 97 councils and over 1,500 sites, the 'Super Counts' are Australia's largest cycling surveys of their kind.\nBicycle Network have used a consistent methodology across Australia to collect consistent figures on cycling participation. The data can be used to compliment other traffic surveys, such as automated systems by providing a broader picture of cycling trends at both a local and national scale.\nFor more information please visit Bicycle Network Bike Counts.\nBicycle counts help track progress, and identify areas of improvement to inform active transport policy with the goal of making it easier for more people to choose active modes everyday. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nAURIN has spatially enabled this dataset by creating geometries from the latitude and longitude columns with PostGIS.",

    "title": "Parent record: Water exchange processes between Jervis Bay and shelf waters",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe third of these six experiments was designed to monitor the exchange of water between the bay and the shelf. The data collection spanned one year from April 1989 to April 1990, in order to get an indication of seasonal variability in the flow. Throughout the 12 month period, 3 current meter moorings, a separate tide gauge mooring and a meteorological station were maintained. \n\nTypical mooring deployments were 2 months with inter-deployment gaps of 1 or 2 days. Moorings were re-deployed in nominally the same location, although these varied slightly. Two moorings were maintained in the bay entrance, one off Point Perpendicular and one off Bowen Island, each containing two current meters. A third mooring was in 100m water depth, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular and this mooring housed 3 current meters and a tide gauge. A separate tide gauge was maintained in a mooring in 10m of water, 200m off Bowen Island, inside the bay. [Given that meteorological data collected from the station on Governor Head bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There are four subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n089f8080-c897-11dc-85f3-00188b4c0af8\na2c0a820-c576-11dc-b888-00188b4c0af8\nd03f0f00-c47a-11dc-9a66-00188b4c0af8\ne4eaf410-d469-11dc-9644-00188b4c0af8",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Bonito model in the Marine Fisheries node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.\nMaps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each season, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the five global climate models (GCMs) used for the Marine Fisheries node, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "The Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914 provides the Governor of Western Australia the power to proclaim or prescribe through regulation a Surface Water Area. A Surface Water Area is proclaimed for the purposes of regulating the taking of water from watercourses and wetlands. An area is proclaimed, or prescribed through regulations, where there is a need for systematic management of the use of water. The proclamation is made on the recommendation of the Department and must first be tabled before both Houses of Parliament.\n\nProclaiming or prescribing an area has the effect of allowing the use of water for commercial activity under a licence. Where an area has been proclaimed, the provisions of Division 1B of Part III of the Act apply to surface water in that area. This allows comprehensive management of water uses in that area.\n\nThis dataset defines the boundaries which are proclaimed as Irrigation Districts (IDs) under the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act, 1914 (RIWI Act). In addition to the boundary definition within the Act these areas are subject to Division 1B of the Act which implements \nlicensing of water use from watercourses and wetlands in the area.\n\nIrrigation districts are areas where the Water Corporation or another service provider may construct work and supply water to land owners for irrigation purposes.\n\nThis dataset is the result of combining three existing datasets; RIWI Areas, RIWI Irrigation Districts and RIWI Surface Water Areas. It replaces all three.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as RIWI Act, Surface Water Areas and Irrigation Districts (DOW-019)",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nBrackish basil aquifer data indicates the approximate boundary of the basal aquifer with brackish or saline water, on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behaviour on the island.\nThe boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the brackish or saline basal aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but\nthis could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection.   In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift. \nDisclaimer",

The model outputs include high streamflow calibration results and low streamflow calibration results. \n\nThe AWRA-L model version 4.5 has been used for all BA surface water simulations. The application is developed with the C\\# language. The executable file \"BACalibrationAndSimulationApp.exe\" generates global definition files which define the input and output data and input time series locations. The executable file \"SimulateModel.exe\" runs simulations based on the global definition files and outputs required variables (Qtot, Qb, Dd) in NetCDF format. All simulation runs have implemented on local Windows 7 work stations.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis data used as a reference to evaluate uncertainty analysis results.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis is the model calibration results obtained from AWRA-L model.The model outputs include high streamflow calibration results and low streamflow calibration results.The model calibration was carried out against historical streamflow data obtained from 16 catchments, which was obtained in in 2 February 2014.  \n\n\n\nThe model calibration outputs were generated in 20 November 2014.\n\n\n\nThe executable file \"BACalibrationAndSimulationApp.exe\" generates global definition files which define the input and output data and input time series locations.

    "description": "A reconnaissance survey of the eastern half of the Canberra 4-mile sheet was made during the period January - February 1952. The area mapped may be arbitrarily divided into two sections: the western section includes the eastern halves of the Canberra, Michelago, and Bredbo 1-mile sheets, and the eastern section comprises four 1-mile sheets - Lake Bathurst, Braidwood, Araluen and Bendethera. Belts of strongly folded Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian strata, with associated elongate masses of granite rocks, were encountered; they trend gradually northwards. Graptolites collected from Ordovician strata provide means to date these rocks accurately, and further study of the corals collected from Silurian limestones will similarly permit precise dating. Three fossil localities were found in the Devonian strata, but the brachiopods collected, although well-preserved and representative of many genera, do not permit precise stratigraphical placing without more intensive examination. Outcrops are generally very good in all parts except the Lake Bathurst area, where an extensive cover of Tertiary and later deposits obscures the Palaeozoic rocks.",

    "title": "Probabilistic tsunami inundation assessment from a near-field earthquake source",
    "description": "Tsunamis are a destructive and dangerous hazard for coastal communities. To prepare for future events, Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA) can be used to estimate the frequency and severity of tsunamis. Large-scale PTHAs have been developed by modelling a suite of tsunami events to robustly represent all possible earthquake-generated tsunamis (Behrens et al., 2021). The 2018 Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA18) is a global PTHA that serves as a database of offshore tsunami frequency and wave data (Davies &amp; Griffin, 2018). In this presentation, we will demonstrate the efficient conversion of offshore PTHA18 data to onshore probabilistic inundation data (Figure 1) through the modelling of a stratified random sample of tsunami events. The town of Vanimo in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is used as a case study.  \n\nWe consider the tsunami threat to the north coast of PNG from earthquakes generated in the New Guinea subduction zone. PNG does not currently have a comprehensive tsunami warning system. However, in the case of the New Guinea trench, ground shaking from a large earthquake may provide communities with some warning and, should this occur, PNG government advice is to evacuate to locations 800 m from the coastline (Kawata et al., 1999). Results suggest that this directive is a safe one and inundation further than 800 m inland is estimated to occur with a very low frequency. Evacuation to this distance from the coast may, however, not be achievable within the short period of time between a large earthquake on this trench and the resulting tsunami. Tsunami arrival times are estimated to be &lt;10 min at an average frequency of roughly once in 300 years (Annual Exceedance Probability of 0.333). For Vanimo specifically, this guidance may be best followed in combination with evacuation to at least 5 m elevation. This allows for evacuation to the high elevation Vanimo peninsula (Figure 1) which is close to population centres on the isthmus, and is estimated to be inundated less frequently than other sites within 800 m of the coastline.   \n\nThe offshore PTHA maximum water levels above Mean Sea Level (MSL) show a positive linear correlation with onshore maximum water levels. Linear regression data for every 10x10m cell in the model domain shows how the elevation features influence tsunami wave amplification. The linear regression coefficient at the coastline (0 m elevation) is between 1 and 1.6 with R2 varying between 0.8 and 0.95. Shoaling is apparent in the nearshore and amplification is greater on the exposed, seaward side of the Vanimo peninsula than in more sheltered locations. Such variation makes a good case for applying comprehensive probabilistic inundation as opposed to simpler methods. Conclusions may be applicable to other locations with a near-field source. \n\nPresented at the 24th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM2021)",

The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries.\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nSmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them.\n\n\nLarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level.\n\n\nAs far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future is the official state government projection of population and households. Projections are based on trends and assumptions for births, life expectancy, migration, and living arrangements across all of Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nPlease Note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow a longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n\nThe results are driven by assumptions concerning demographic and land-use trends. Projections are based on the latest (30 June 2014) population estimates from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). \n\n\nVictoria in Future 2015 population projections are not predictions of the future nor are they targets.\n\n",

    "description": "Three widely separated scout holes totalling 566 feet of drilling were drilled to investigate the possibilities of open-cut mining sites on the Australasian Seam immediately to the west and south-west of West Wallsend, a suburb of the city of Newcastle. Only one hole intersected the Australasian Seam. This hole indicated that the seam was much banded and of inferior quality - below present open-cut coal standard. Analyses suggested that it may be possible to mine a section of coal 8 feet 7 inches thick excluding non-coal bands, and that this coal would have an ash content of about 29% and calorific value of 10,000 B.Th.U. per lb. after the exclusion of bands.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

The NSW Education Act states that instruction provided in government schools is to be free of charge, except for overseas students. Students must have access to the minimum curriculum and not be denied the opportunity to meet syllabus requirements because of non-payment of voluntary school contributions.\n\n\nSchools may request contributions for elective subjects for resources that go beyond the minimum requirements of the curriculum following consultation with the school community. Parents and carers who are unable to pay elective subject contributions because of financial hardship may be eligible for assistance from the school.\n\n\nPrincipals can decide on voluntary school contributions and elective subject contributions following consultation with the school community, through structures such as the Parents and Citizens Association (P&amp;C) or the finance/resourcing committee.\n\n\nPrincipals must ensure that students and families who are unable to make a voluntary school contribution or elective subject contribution do not experience any embarrassment or discrimination.

Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.",

    "description": "Eleven scout drill holes entailing 1290 feet of drilling were sunk to find suitable open-cut prospecting areas for the Young Wallsend Seam of the \"Upper\" Coal Measures within an area of one square mile in Portion 10, Parish of Hexham, Newcastle Region, N.S.W. Several drill holes intersected the Dudley (?) and Yard Seams overlying the Young Wallsend Seam. The scout drilling defined the following inferred reserves of coal: [see record for table data]. These figures do not take into account weathering and possible worked-out areas which may reduce the reserves by as much as 30%. The seams are banded and the quality of the coal could probably be improved considerably by washing. The scout drilling did not define accurately the overburden ratios; however, it is likely that overburden to coal ratio for the Dudley (?) Seam will average very roughly 5:1 and for Young Wallsend about 9:1 if the Dudley is mined beforehand where it overlies the Young Wallsend. These results did not justify commencing a \"testing and defining\" drilling programme. The Yard Seam was not investigated in detail; its thinness precludes it from having any importance for open-cut mining.",

    "description": "\nThis dataset shows land parcels owned by Melbourne Water that have potential to be utilised for liveability related projects. The data does not provide a guarantee that the land can be used, or used by any particular activity. Authority to use the land will still need to be assessed and granted by Melbourne Water. Due to the restrictive nature of potentially using land containing assets such as pipes, pits, retarding basins etc the land has been classified into three landuse types. These types describe the potential for using the land area for different purposes. Land classified as &quot;A&quot; (or &quot;Likely Available&quot;) are those area that are likely to be available for community projects and could be used for a variety of purposes depending on the space. Land classified as &quot;L&quot; (or &quot;Restrictions Apply&quot;) are areas likely to be available for small scale or portable infrastructure such as park benches, goal posts, landscaping and temporary food vans. They are unlikely to be available for large scale infrastructure due to access, drainage, safety, current lease or licence agreements or other requirements. Land classified as &quot;X&quot; (or &quot;Access Only&quot;) are areas likely to be available for access related activities such as walking, running or yoga. 24 hour access is usually required and infrastructure is unlikely to be permitted. To apply, visit: <a href=\"https://melbournewater.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=e60e956c9f304027802e9bef6177fac1\">Our Space Your Place</a>\n\nApproximately 100 Melbourne Water asset datasets were used in the creation of this dataset. Rules governing the use of land on and around each asset class were established and applied to these areas. Coverage is across approximately 80% of MW owned land areas. The next edition aims to increase this to all applicable MW owned land.\n\nFor more details: <a href=\"https://www.melbournewater.com.au/community-and-education/use-our-land/land-community-projects\">Land and Community Projects (link to MW website)</a>\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. The metadata was not provided by the data supplier and has been compiled by the programme based on known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset was supplied as an outcome of the Hunter Asset Workshop by NSW Office of Water.  \n\n\n\nStatus and FType fields were updated based on the GDS (groundwater database) data extraction. \n\nSuggestions of what Asset type should be were added under 'Comments'.\n\n\n\nThere are 694 bores with Unknown Ftype (listed in 'Unknown' sheet). \n\nAnother data extraction using Brio Query to get the Work Comments info managed to get the work purpose for 600+ bores. \n\n67 remaining bores or 1% of the bore data with Unknown purpose and status remained.  Data provider suggests remaining 67 bores should be 'NULL' asset.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis dataset was created to populate missing values for FTYPE in the initial creation of the GW Economic Elements for Hunter (GUID).  The NSW Office of water was supplied with records where FTYPE was unknown and they subsequently queried their database for these records.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nStatus and FType fields were updated based on the GDS (groundwater database) data extraction. \n\nSuggestions of what Asset type should be were added under 'Comments' \n\n\n\nThere are 694 bores with Unknown Ftype (listed in 'Unknown' sheet). \n\nAnother data extraction using Brio Query to get the Work Comments info managed to get the work purpose for 600+ bores. \n\n67 remaining bores or 1% of the bore data with Unknown purpose and status remained.  Data provider suggests remaining 67 bores should be 'NULL' asset.\n\n\n\nNote: Source file includes Surface Water records (ones without 'GW' at beginning of BOREID Field need to be excluded if only performing GW analysis)\n\n\n\nOnly first 2 worksheets are Outputs (Praveen & Unknowns). Others are working spreadsheets for the purpose of extracting the data\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2015) GW Element Bores with Unknown FTYPE Hunter NSW Office of Water 20150514.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "This dataset contains temperature data obtained from XBTs (expendable bathythermographs) deployed by vessels during different cruises between Tahiti and Auckland (New Zealand).\n\nExpendable Bathythermographs (XBTs) have been used for many years by oceanographers to measure the temperature of the upper ocean. These instruments are simple devices which are designed to be deployed from moving vessels, enabling broad scale coverage of the world's oceans.",
