    "description": "18 Australian Agricultural Environments (AAEs) developed by ABARES to stratify survey collection and analysis for the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Land Management Practices Survey (LaMPS). The ABS conducted the LaMPS to support Common Practices Assessments for the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI). The 18 AAEs differentiate broad environmental, land use and land management patterns across Australia’s agricultural landscapes. The regionalisation combines ABS statistical units with published agro-ecological regions. The AAEs have been specifically developed to stratify data collection and analysis for the LaMPS and users of this regional classification should be aware of the limitations and currency of the underlying information when using these regional boundaries.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2013. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2013.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below.

Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for September 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2050 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin.Areas of risk are based on groundwater levels and air photo\r\ninterpretation. The merged data, at a nominal scale of 1:250 000, show actual\r\nareas where dryland salinity or water-tables less than 2 metres have been\r\nmeasured. For the extent map, every delineated area is underpinned by either\r\nair photo data or by one or more groundwater bores. Therefore, the area at\r\nrisk is regarded as conservative due to limitations in the spatial coverage of\r\nair photo and bore data.  number of techniques to spatially extrapolate these\r\ndata to infer potential areas at risk were trialed but were considered\r\nscientifically or statistically inadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on\r\nareas at risk having groundwater levels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment\r\nbased on groundwater less than 5 m and rising was considered inappropriate.\r\nTotal areas affected with groundwater less than 5 m and rising have been\r\npresented, but only for improved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a03.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for June 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Core GC04, was collected from the southeastern side of the New Caledonian Basin (22.99965 S, 166.150716 E). The age of the sediment at each sample depth was determined by correlating oxygen isotopes to the Martinson et al. (1987) age model. This information can then be used to infer sedimentation rates. The results indicate that core GC04 is characterised by slow sedimentation rates. The average sedimentation rate is 1.46cm/kyr. The minimum sedimentation rate is ~0.03cm/Kyr, occurring at around MIS 5c and maximum ~4cm/Ka occurring around MIS 5e.",

V. azureus cells were exposed to various different concentrations of both toxicants over acute (15, 30 min) and chronic (&gt;24 h) exposure periods. In addition, luminescence data from the industry standard bacterial species, Aliivibrio fischeri, is included to benchmark the new bacterial toxicity assay.\n\nFor full methodological and analytical details please refer to the full research publication, Luter et al.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for April 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "title": "Current meter and tidal gauge data obtained from a mooring off Bowen Island, Jervis Bay: 05/04/89 - 27/03/90",
    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed at the entrance of Jervis Bay, just off Bowen Island. This mooring housed 2 current meters, at 12m and 30m. Over a period of approx. 1yr the mooring was deployed 5 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1 - 35.11 S, 150.78 E. Deployments 2->5 - 35.11 S, 150.772 E.\nDatasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the two current meters over the year. \n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 5 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets, present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2, 3, 4, 5). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1)  5/4/89 - 4/6/89... 2) 23/6/89 - 28/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 13/11/89... 4) 14/11/89 - 29/1/90... 5) 31/1/90 - 28/3/90\n\nTIDE GAUGE: The tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~35m during the first deployment. Curiously, additional tidal data was gathered from this approximate location (see record for exact coordinates) after the final deployment, between 28/3/90 and 12/7/90. The height of the tidal gauge was also raised to 10m for this additional deployment. In both datasets the tide gauge recorded temperature as well as depth.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for May 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2018. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTskin L3S product for 6 consecutive day-time periods, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 6 day average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "This project will map the genetic and phylogenetic diversity of northeast Queensland rainforest plants and fungi with a focus on the mountaintop species, which are regarded as among the most at risk from climate warming. The project consists of two nested subprojects. \n\nProject ¿a¿ (PD analysis) will provide a broad scale analysis of patterns of genetic diversity across the NE Qld rainforests. This study will investigate the relative performance of taxonomic richness and phylogenetic diversity measures for conservation priority setting in the Wet Tropics and Cape York rainforest contexts. We will use the results to identify and map areas of high biodiversity significance and investigate correlations with environmental and ecological variables. Preliminary results to date show that areas with higher PD than expected contain a higher proportion of immigrant plant lineages dispersed mostly from Southeast Asia within the past few million years. Our results demonstrate how the integration of historical data and PD can more effectively inform conservation priority setting particularly in biomes with complex evolutionary histories. \n\nProject ¿b¿ (mountain-top diversity) takes a finer scale look at population-level genetic diversity in one highly restricted rainforest ecosystem ¿ mountain-top rainforest ¿ projected to be most threatened by climate change. We will combine emerging genetic technologies with environmental, ecological and morphological information to: 1) elucidate the location and relative importance of high altitude refugia for plants in the Wet Tropics and Cape York Peninsula Bioregions and the mechanisms that influence the survival of populations and species; and 2) document the fungal biodiversity of the mountain tops.",

This 'Blue' mooring (35.035 S, 150.753 E) held one S4 Interocean current meter at a depth of 5.5 metres below sea-level, and one Aanderaa RCM4S current meter at 11.5 mbsl. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 1 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.\n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: the file containing the 10min sample readings for the meter at 5.5m has not been located**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

    "title": "Parent record: Meteorological data recorded during the Jervis Bay Baseline Studies Project",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThis record doesn't describe one of these six  experiments per se, but the data collected from a meteorological station at Governor Head. This Steedman EMS-16 meteorological station housed a R.M. Young anemometer and YSI barometer to measure wind and atmospheric pressure respectively. The site at Governor Head was several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and was 63m above sea-level.\n\nWind data was also collected from an anemometer located at Huskisson, on the west shore of Jervis Bay. This anemometer was operated at the time by the NSW Public Works Department.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also provided is a pdf of a working paper that describes the operating and data processing procedures that relate to the meteorological station. There are 36 subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree).",

The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focused on rice growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where almost all of Australia's rice is produced. \r\n\r\n After 100 per cent closing water allocations in 2012-13, there were falls in allocations in 2013-14 and particularly in 2014-15. Average farm cash incomes in 2014-15 fell by around 28 per cent to around $132 000. The average rate of return was 1.7 per cent, higher than the average for all survey years of 1.3 per cent. \r\n\r\n All rice growers used flood irrigation because of the need to apply large volumes of water to rice crops at high delivery rates. \r\n\r\n In most survey years, a majority of rice farms did not buy or sell irrigation water. Of those farms that did trade water, there were more sellers than buyers of water. On average, sellers of water recorded higher rates of return on capital than either buyers or those not trading water. ",

    "description": "ABARES has produced the 2016 update to the About My Region reports. Based on the regional boundaries set by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ASGS SA4 regions), each regional profile presents an overview of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors in the region and the recent financial performance of the broadacre and, where relevant, dairy and vegetable industries. These reports are being released for the first time online as a series of web pages. \r\n\r\nAbout My Region consists of the 56 profiles and a web site providing access. The web site contains a list of regions, organised by state that link to the profiles. The About My Region report series is already available on the ABARES website, however, for the first time the latest updates will be published as a set of web pages. All data used in the update of these profiles have previously been released by ABARES or ABS. \r\n\r\n The December 2016 issue updates one section of each profile, giving the most recent available data on the number and type of farms by industry classification, and the distribution of farms by estimated value of agricultural operations (EVAO). \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Overview Since 2007 ABARES has conducted an annual survey of vegetable growing farm businesses to provide industry and government with information about farm-level production and the financial situation of vegetable growers. This report contains results from the ABARES survey of vegetable growing farms conducted from March to June 2016, which collected data on the characteristics of vegetable farms in 2014-15 and 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• In 2015-16 average farm cash income of Australian vegetable-growing farms is estimated to have increased to around $249 000 per farm. Vegetable cash receipts increased as a result of higher vegetable production, mainly from an increase in crop yields. \r\n• The average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) of Australian vegetable-growing farms increased to 3.0 per cent in 2014-15 and 3.6 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n• In 2014-15 an estimated 12 per cent of vegetable-growing farms made additions to total capital. These consisted primarily of land purchases but also included plant, machinery and equipment. \r\n• The majority of debt held by Australian vegetable-growing farms is for working capital management and land purchases. Nationally, farm debt fell by 7 per cent during 2014-15 to an average of $454 200 (in 2015-16 dollars). \r\n",

    "description": "MacGillivray Reef (formerly known as Shadwell Reef) is located in the Northern Great Barrier Reef province, approximately 270km north of Cairns. Reef drilling was undertaken to investigate the Holocene evolution of the reef using radiocarbon dating of the cored coral material.\n\nTwo windward and two leeward cores were recovered from MacGillivray Reef. Two of the cores were initiated through thrown up coral blocks on the leeward margin which allowed a longer drilling window during the tidal range. Cores Mac 3 and 5 were abandoned due to the rising tide and equipment failure respectively; Mac 4 was abandoned after encountering a thick sand layer. The maximum depth reached was 11 m and 15 m an the windward and leeward margins respectively.\n\nThe cores were logged and photographed, and thin sections were made and petrographically examined. Corals that were determined to be in situ (by the orientation of their corallites) and free from internal cement and detritus by microscope examination were selected for radiocarbon dating.\n\nRadiocarbon dating suggests that MacGillivray platform reef developed on a topographic high, which is assumed to be granite, at a depth of 15 m below the reef flat approximately 8.2 cal kyr BP. The reef only approached present day sea-level within the last 500 years (260 - 80 cal yr BP). Rates of vertical accretion ranged from 1.4 to 5.8 m/kyr.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology.

The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds.

The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP5, a 6m steel pole, which has been installed within the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia.\n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of Heron Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on Heron Island.\n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions.\n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Heron Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on One Tree Island (near by), Orpheus Island (central GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). A light sensor is also located on the Island itself to give measures of PAR.",

    "description": "Article released in the Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resources Economics January 2018. Cite as: Sheng, Y, Jackson, T and Lawson, K ,2018, Evaluating the benefits from transport infrastructure in agriculture: a hedonic analysis of farmland prices. Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics. doi:10.1111/1467-8489.12243 \r\n\r\n Access to transport infrastructure generates a range of benefits to the agriculture sector; many of which are difficult to measure directly. In this study, we use hedonic regression analysis of farm-level data to examine the contribution of transport infrastructure to the value of farmland traded between 2009 and 2011 through its impact on farm productivity. \r\n\r\n We show that a one per cent of reduction in the cost of transportation between farms and ports leads to a 0.33 per cent increase in land prices, and there is no significant difference between rail and road transportation at the aggregate level. Moreover, the benefits generated by particular types of infrastructure services vary between industries and with farm size, suggesting there are multiple channels through which public infrastructure influences agricultural production. Our findings help to inform future investment decisions in Australia and in other countries by providing new evidence regarding the benefits of existing transport infrastructure. ",

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP3, a 6m steel pole, which has been installed at Orpheus Island on the central Great Barrier Reef. The sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions at Orpheus Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on Orpheus Island.\n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions.\n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Orpheus Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on Heron Island (southern GBR), One Tree Island (near by) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). A light sensor is also located on the Island itself to give measures of PAR.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data.

    "title": "Parent record: Vertical coherence of currents in Jervis Bay: Summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe fourth of these six experiments involved the  summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), moored in the central part of Jervis Bay (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the summer deployment, 13th December 1990 to 15th January 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 15 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There is only one subsiduary records that directly relates to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree):\n30d0a700-1fc2-11dd-a7e7-00188b4c0af8",

The infrastructure\ncost impacts are limited to those that occur at the location of salinity\nproblem, downstream and other offsite impacts are not covered. All dollar\nvalues are given in 1996/97 Australian dollars. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Total cost ($) to all infrastructure (buildings, road, rail and\nbridges) based on the low, abesta and high estimates of the impact of the\ncurrent (2000) extent of salinity.2. Total cost ($) to all infrastructure\n(buildings, road, rail and bridges) based on the low, abesta and high\nestimates of the impact of predicted 2020 extent of salinity3. Total cost ($)\nthe general infrastructure component (buildings etc., derived from population)\nas the abesta estimate of the impact of the current (2000) extent of\nsalinity.4. Total cost ($) the general infrastructure component (buildings\netc., derived from population) based on the abesta estimate of the impact of\nthe predicted 2020 extent of salinity5. Total cost ($) the road component of\ninfrastructure based on the abesta estimate of the impact of the current\n(2000) extent of salinity.6. Total cost ($) the road component of\ninfrastructure based on the abesta estimate of the impact of the predicted\n2020 extent of salinity7.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for June 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "The Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters. These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification. Each mooring is equipped with surface CO2 systems, using proven and robust technology. Three sensors will determine surface CO2, temperature and salinity. The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. \n\nAcidification moorings are co-located at three National Reference Stations: * the Yongala NRS in Queensland (replaced in September 2013 after Tropical Cyclone Yasi, and then decommissioned in August 2014), * the Maria Island NRS in Tasmania, and * the Kangaroo Island NRS in South Australia. There is also one site located adjacent to the Heron Island reef slope in the Wistari channel on the Great Barrier Reef. The Yongala, Wistari and Maria Island acidification moorings are located to characterise changes down the east coast of Australia and the influence of the East Australian Current on CO2 uptake and acidification from the Great Barrier Reef to the Southern Ocean. The Kangaroo Island mooring monitors the deeper waters upwelled on the South Australian shelf which are expected to have higher CO2 and thus could accelerate the exposure of ecosystems to acidification earlier than in other regions.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "title": "What difference does labour choice make to farm productivity and profitability in the Australian horticulture industry? A comparison between seasonal workers and working holiday makers",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n The productivity and cost of labour have considerable impacts on farm profitability, especially in the labour intensive horticulture industry. \r\n\r\n In this study, commissioned by the World Bank, we compared the labour productivity of seasonal workers employed under the Australian Government's Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) and working holiday makers, and the implications for farm profitability - using a survey, wages data and interviews with employers participating in the SWP. It builds on a previous ABARES study, by including analysis of the non-wage labour costs and factors that may influence growers' decision-making about labour choices. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n\r\n\r\n• The productivity of seasonal workers was higher than that of working holiday makers for the farm businesses in the study. Seasonal workers were 20 per cent more productive than working holiday makers for fruit picking tasks. Seasonal workers who returned to the farm had higher average productivity as they required minimal induction and training in subsequent seasons. \r\n• The non-wage labour cost related to seasonal workers was 2.3 times higher per hour worked than for working holiday makers, and was strongly influenced by requirements under the SWP such as recruitment, administration processes and training. However, the direct monetary benefits of hiring seasonal workers is likely to at least cover the higher non-wage labour costs and hence deliver a profitability gain. \r\n• This study found that in addition to the direct monetary benefits associated with different labour sources, growers recognised the reliability of seasonal workers as beneficial and a key risk management strategy during labour intensive harvest periods. Working holiday makers provide for greater labour flexibility at short notice. It was common for growers to employ seasonal workers and working holiday makers in a complementary fashion where seasonal workers formed the core of the workforce and working holiday makers were employed casually as needed. \r\n• The study suggests the relatively higher productivity and other benefits of accessing seasonal workers warrant further promotion of the SWP in the Australian horticulture industry. It also suggests that further streamlining the recruitment process and other SWP requirements for approved employers could increase the attractiveness for farmers to participate in the program. \r\n",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe last of these six experiments consisted of a program of approximately monthly surveys of temperature and salinity distributions from within Jervis Bay, out to the edge of the continental shelf. All temperature, conductivity and pressure measurements were made using a high accuracy Neil Brown \"Smart\" CTD operated in a direct reading mode. The instrument was lowered and raised using a hydraulically operated winch at a speed of less than 1 m/s. Measurements were made on both lowering and raising of the CTD.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available are some pdfs of published working papers documenting this experiment and the results. There are nine subsiduary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n6d523cb0-0b78-11dd-89fa-00188b4c0af8\n05818c50-14c2-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\na98cd420-14c3-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\na44b1850-15bd-11dd-9ec7-00188b4c0af8\neb65dd50-14c4-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\n7e03e540-14ba-11dd-bdaa-00188b4c0af8\n4919d4f0-1192-11dd-a074-00188b4c0af8\n7f83d0c0-1194-11dd-a074-00188b4c0af8\n0c995f90-15a8-11dd-9ec7-00188b4c0af8",

This 'Red' mooring (35.0883 S, 150.7333 E) held four S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 14.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.   \n\nThe final dataset provides the depth averaged current component data in 10 minute samples at this site. Eastern and northern current components are provided.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2020. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during winter were very favourable, and crops are generally in very good condition at the beginning of spring. \r\n• In parts of New South Wales and far southern Western Australia crops were waterlogged by very high winter rainfall, which is expected to constrain yields in these regions. \r\n• In its latest three-month rainfall outlook (September to November 2016), issued on 25 August 2016, the Bureau of Meteorology forecast spring rainfall to be around average in most cropping regions in Australia. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 16 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 46.1 million tonnes, driven by significant increases in forecast production in Western Australia and Victoria. \r\n• Wheat production is forecast to increase by 16 per cent in 2016-17 to 28.1 million tonnes, barley production by 11 per cent to 9.5 million tonnes and canola production by 23 per cent to around 3.6 million tonnes. Wheat and barley production are both forecast to be the second highest on record and canola production to be the third highest. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Planting conditions for dryland crops are expected to be favourable, and supplies of irrigation water for irrigated crops are expected to be higher than in 2015-16. \r\n• Forecast increases in area planted to rice and cotton in 2016-17 are expected to more than offset a forecast fall in area planted to grain sorghum. \r\n• Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 28 per cent to around 4.8 million tonnes. \r\n",

The pole provides network connectivity for the other Relay Poles located on the northen edge of Orpheus Island (RP2 and RP3) as well as a back-haul link to the mainland using a nextG connection.\n\nThe pole has an array of sensors on it including two MEA thermistors located 50m and 100m away from the pole on a transect from the pole into the deep water of the channel. The pole also has a SeaBird SBE39 (temp + pressure) located around 100m from teh pole and a SBE37 (conductivity, temperature and pressure) located approximatly 200m from teh pole in the deep waters of the channels.

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The behaviour of U. capricornis is not well-known. Consequently, observations were made for approximately 1100 hours over 4 seasons to obtain a general picture of their social system and behaviour. The study was conducted on a large population of Uca capricornis in the vicinity of the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin. Fieldwork was conducted yearly from November-January, 2002-2006. \n\nTo obtain a more detailed description of the relationship between males and females, the natural interactions between males and females living as nearest neighbours were recorded. Twenty-one pairs were filmed from overhead for a period of 30 minutes. Any activity was noted, as was any interactions with intruders. \n\nTerritoriality was also examined, providing the overall area covered by the crabs within the half hour. By aligning the male and female territories with their respective burrows it was possible to determine the area overlap between them.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for December 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "title": "A stocktake of selected agricultural markets of the European Union - Opportunities for Australia",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n The report A stocktake of selected agricultural markets of the European Union: Opportunities for Australia compiles five articles on EU agricultural industries that were originally published in ABARES Agricultural Commodities quarterly reports between June 2016 and March 2017. These articles were on almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. The report examines EU domestic policies and markets, and trade opportunities for Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Since the mid 1990s the share of total Australian exports destined for the EU has been declining in favour of more lucrative and geographically closer Asian markets. \r\n• Part of the reason for the decline in the share of Australian exports to the EU has been caused by the regulation that supports the EU agricultural sector. EU agricultural imports are subject to restrictive quotas, in-quota tariffs and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• The Australian Government and the European Commission are working towards commencing negotiations for a free trade agreement. As the European Union is one of the largest consumers of agricultural goods in the world, a preferential agreement that improves access to the EU market may present opportunities for Australian agricultural exporters. \r\n• The commodities covered in this report are almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. These are high value or growing Australian agricultural industries. \r\n• The EU imports agricultural products from a large number of countries and has numerous existing trade arrangements with these countries. Australia therefore faces significant competition in the EU market for the five commodities. \r\n• The articles discuss the existing trade trends and EU policies for each of the five commodities. For beef, dairy and sugar it is posited that only a significant reduction in tariffs or enlargement of quotas would precipitate a strong diversion of Australian trade away from the geographically closer Asian markets to the European Union. This is because of weakening EU import demand given growing supplies of lower-priced, domestically produced product. \r\n• Australian exports of sheep meat to the European Union are constrained by a relatively small quota of 20,000 tonnes, which it has largely filled in each of the past 5 years. Australian exporters of sheep meat would benefit from improved access to that market given strengthening EU demand for sheep meat and relatively high prices. \r\n• EU imports of almonds are subject to a low tariff and import demand has been growing steadily. Removal of the tariff on Australian almonds would improve Australia's relative competitiveness but gains are expected to be modest over the medium term given the dominant foothold of the United States in the EU almond market. \r\n• The effect of Brexit on EU agricultural commodities markets and trade is uncertain at this stage. \r\n",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.

The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area).

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Crabs sometimes vacate their territories due to continued harassment by their neighbours. To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. 20 Focal males were selected: 10 with male nearest neighbours and 10 with female nearest neighbours. The following day, at the same time relative to low tide, we determined whether the crabs were in the same burrows. Data recorded included: the tidal height and time, and whether each crab was present or not. A new set of 20 pairs were marked each day over a period of 26 days. \n\nThe data suggests the crabs were less likely to change burrows during neap tides. Males with female neighbours also tended to be more stable than males with male neighbours.",

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual retained catch (meaning the catch that is not returned to the sea) in kilograms, by species and fishery, for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea, where generally the weights are estimates only. Fish discarded at sea are not included in this dataset. Location of catches within a fishery is not included.\r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Fishers usually cannot accurately weigh fish at sea, so the estimated weights are mostly based on volume (i.e. the size and number of boxes of fish caught). Catch data are used in combination with gear, effort, and spatial data to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may filter out catches from their assessments because of data quality issues or group species differently. In addition, the data may be different in other datasets with different summations such as catch by season or catch from the date fish were landed at port.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect catches each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as: total allowable catch, closures of fishing areas, reducing boat numbers, or banning the catch of a particular species. Similarly, changes in market demand can affect which species are targeted. \r\nWhen the fish are landed at port, the accurate weight of fish is recorded in AFMA catch disposal records by both the fisher and fish receiver permit holder. This information can be found in the “Reported landed annual catch from Commonwealth fisheries catch disposal records” and its metadata, which is published on data.gov.au. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in the species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness, and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1990 to February 1991. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "This publication was produced by CSIRO for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation with research and data support by ABARES.  \r\n\r\n The report develops a framework that can be used to assist managers to cost effectively develop target reference points that are consistent with the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy Policy for multispecies in mixed fisheries. The report addresses the problem of determining appropriate target reference points for target and by-product stocks in multispecies fisheries. The applicability of this framework is demonstrated using a case study fishery, the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. \r\n\r\n The report uses generic logistic and exponential bio-economic models to produce a target reference point consistent with the current management framework taking into consideration a wide range of biological and economic conditions. The output was included in the development of a generic decision support framework using two cost effective approaches: regression tree analysis and the Bayesian Network approach. Sensitivity tests were also conducted on all 4 models. The project also develops a separate set of bio-economic models specific to the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery examining the static and dynamic aspects of maximum economic yield. \r\n\r\n The results from the generic models suggest that the key determinants of the target reference point of individual species in multispecies mixed fisheries are catchability, growth rates and share of total fishery revenue. Other variables, such as costs of fishing, prices and number of species in the fishery are also influential but to a lesser degree. For the case study fishery, both of the cost effective approaches performed well and achieved better results than the current default proxy target reference point. An incidental result from the study is that attempting to impose a target reference point on all species may not be necessary (or feasible) in multispecies fisheries. Instead, imposing a target on the dominant species (in terms of revenue share) for each sub-fleet results in outcomes close to optimal, and reduces conflicts in catches where target reference points are not perfectly aligned.

    "description": "The values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) are threatened by coastal development through habitat loss and runoff of sediment, nutrients and pollutants. Future coastal development is difficult to predict because it depends on volatile socio-economic and political factors. With this in mind, we developed a research project that uses spatially explicit scenario planning to identify plausible futures to 2035 for the GBRWHA coastal zone. The method used to produce maps of these scenarios is land-use change modelling using the GIS Idrisi. A governance analysis for the GBR coast is part of the project and is included in the scenario-planning process. Using a conservation planning approach, this project sets out to identify key priorities for restoring and protecting coastal ecosystems in the GBRWHA coastal zone. The objectives are to:\n- Compile spatial data on the coastal ecosystems and socio-economic characteristics of the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Produce spatially explicit land use scenarios for the GBRWHA coastal zone to 2035\n- Analyse the governance system in the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Identify conservation goals for the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Assess impacts of development for assets related to the conservation goals\n- Bring all the above information together to determine spatial options for allocating protection and restoration actions to achieve goals",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Rapidly changing operating environments of government and their stakeholders threaten to outdate existing policy practices. Policymakers will need to adopt fresh ways of thinking, develop new skills and access innovative ideas. This will affect government policy making on issues affecting agriculture, fishing, forestry, water and rural communities more broadly. This report brings together a set of innovative ideas that collectively offer new thinking, new skills and new tools for policymakers both in the department and elsewhere. Innovation in policy and regulatory practice will help us continue to deliver outcomes for Australian agriculture and the community. The report reinforces the department's commitment to innovation as a core capability for the future. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The report comprises a wide range of findings resulting from a global scan of online and expert sources. The analysis reflects on issues - such as governance, risk and capability - that might affect the adoption of innovations within a government setting. \r\n\r\n Report findings are classified into three emergent themes that are interdependent in nature: \r\n• Thinking in new ways is critical to improving policy practice. Innovative thinking considers knowledge to be socially created, rather than a set of hard, incontestable facts. \r\n• New skills in contemporary and innovative practices can increase the range and depth of existing public sector capabilities \r\n• New tools for policymakers can improve the overall policy process and provide innovative policy instruments for specific policy problems. \r\n Innovation in government differs from private sector innovation, because these sectors vary considerably in their approach to risk, public accountability and managing success.

    "description": "This report presents detailed financial performance of slaughter lamb producing farms in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 and discusses productivity in a historical context. The report was commissioned by Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and expands on results that were published in  Agricultural Commodities (March quarter 2015)  and the  Australian farm survey results 2012-13 to 2014-15  report released in March 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Most farms producing lambs for slaughter are mixed enterprises, deriving receipts from cropping, beef cattle, sheep and wool and from the sale of slaughter lambs. \r\n• Farm cash income of specialist slaughter lamb producing farms, those farms most reliant on lamb production, is estimated to have increased from an average of $80 900 a farm in 2013-14 to $98 300 a farm in 2014-15. This increase was mainly a result of higher prices for lambs and sheep. \r\n• Farm cash incomes and business profit of all slaughter lamb producers are estimated to have fallen in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14. Reduced grain production in 2014-15 is estimated to have resulted in lower average total receipts of slaughter lamb producing farms despite an increase in sheep and lamb receipts mainly a result of increased prices. Average farm cash income of slaughter lamb producers is estimated to have declined by 8 per cent from an average of $180 100 a farm in 2013-14 to $166 000 a farm in 2014-15, in real terms. \r\n• Farm debt of slaughter lamb producing farms averaged $649 577 a farm in 2013-14, slightly more than that in 2012-13 ($641 400). Farm debt is estimated to have reduced in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 as a result of loan repayment and reductions in new borrowings. \r\n• Asset values and new investment remain high for slaughter lamb producing farms and while debt is also high, equity ratios and debt servicing are in line with long-term averages. \r\n",

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Forests of Australia (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\n*Forests of Australia (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, \r\n including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as \"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to\r\nstate and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2016), also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2016), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map\r\nas forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

Once the estimated ice volume effect has been accounted for, this still leaves a substantial difference 18O which must be accounted for through significant changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) or salinity.

Thousands of tests are run and these measurements are used to calculate average speeds achieved and other metrics for different volunteer groups, such as volunteers on the NBN fixed-line services and volunteers on NBN fixed wireless services. The summary data released includes test results for all Whiteboxes used in MBA Report 17 for download, upload, latency and outages metrics. The results are de-identified to protect the privacy of the volunteers and the integrity of the MBA program.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "In the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, males attract females to their burrows by waving their enlarged yellow claw. Colour is clearly involved in species recognition in U. mjoebergi, but the role of the species-specific colour pattern has not been investigated. \n\nHere we show that U. mjoebergi females preferentially approach uniformaly yellow claws over bicoloured, yellow and white, claws. This is not due to a preference for a larger yellow signal, as they fail to discriminate between bicoloured claws differing in the proportion of yellow. Claw colour and pattern appear to be equally important in the recognition of conspecific males, as females do not distinguish between a uniformly coloured claw of the wrong colour and a claw containing yellow in the wrong pattern.\n\nExperiments were conducted in October 2005, near the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This report examines three potential outlook scenarios for Australia's forestry sector using analysis of the potential availability and use of logs, forecasts of wood product consumption, and the opportunities for processing of wood products and investment. \r\n\r\n ABARES conducted a number of workshops with industry and government stakeholders to refine the scenarios and test the assumptions supporting this analysis. A business-as-usual scenario was analysed, which depicts a future assuming current economic, policy and environmental factors affecting the forestry sector remain unchanged over the projection period (to 2050). Two alternative scenarios (priority-to-productivity and constrained-wood-production) are also examined. Sensitivity testing was also conducted to identify the influence of key parameters. \r\n\r\n The analysis in this report highlights some key opportunities for Australia's forestry sector, as well as the economic and policy factors required for realising these opportunities. The results affirm that a positive investment environment for upgrading and expanding wood processing infrastructure will underpin growth in Australia's forestry sector. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

It allows for the fair distribution of property among creditors and the prosecution of dishonest debtors.\r\n\r\nA debt agreement is an arrangement between a person who cannot pay their debts and their creditors. It is a formal arrangement under Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act. A debt agreement results from creditors voting to accept a proposal from a debtor to settle their debts. To be eligible to propose a debt agreement, a debtor must be insolvent and meet threshold levels relating to unsecured debts and assets and after-tax income.\r\n\r\nPersonal insolvency agreement (PIA): under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act, a personal insolvency agreement results from creditors accepting a debtor’s proposal to settle his or her debts. Unlike debt agreements, personal insolvency agreements are not subject to income, asset or debt thresholds.\r\n\r\nPlease see our guide to learn more about the provisional personal insolvency statistics",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1988 to February 1989. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Achieving an efficient allocation of fishery resource stocks between commercial and recreational fishers is often hampered by incomplete information about the economic value of these fisheries to the community. Economic data for Australia's recreational fishing sector are currently not readily available in a form that can be used for resource allocation decisions. The little data that are available provide a limited picture of the economic value of the sector. This is largely due to the non-market nature of goods produced by recreational fishing. \r\n\r\n This paper provides a theoretical framework for how non-market values associated with recreational fishing can be derived using the travel cost method. It then combines this with economic information from the commercial sector to assess the effect of changes in allocation of a fish stock between recreational and commercial fishers. The framework assumes that the commercial and recreational catch is regulated via a total allowable catch. The paper also highlights some of the impediments of using this framework in applied analysis. The description of the travel cost method in a recreational fishing context is supported by a summary of some recent work undertaken by ABARES in valuing game fishing activities in eastern Australia. \r\n",

    "description": "Since the 1980s the managers of alpine resorts have collected information on visitation numbers.  Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1989. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Research, development and extension (RD&E) is central to the competitiveness of Australia's agriculture industry. Growth in investment pushed the value of RD&E funding in Australia to $3.3 billion in 2014-15. Funding for rural R&D increased from $2.6 billion ten years before, in real terms. This includes public and private investment related to primary production, sustainable resource use, agricultural inputs and the processing sector. \r\n\r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Public sector delivering the R&D building blocks  \r\n\r\n• The public sector remains the largest overall source of rural R&D funding. Public funding for rural R&D increased from $1.4 billion to $1.54 billion (in real terms). This growth was driven by growth in funding from the Australian Government and universities, which offset a decline in funding from the state and territory governments. The public sector plays an important role in funding R&D particularly longer-term fundamental research. \r\n\r\n Private sector funding boosting R&D investment  \r\n\r\n• The private sector funding grew strongly over the ten years examined and now plays a greater role in funding rural R&D. Total private R&D funding increased from $912 million in 2005-06 to $1.46 billion in 2014-15 in real terms. Greater private funding stemmed from private firms increasing investment in their own R&D, with slower growth in contributions to the rural Research and Development Corporations (RDCs). \r\n\r\n Based on recent trends in Australia and internationally, the private sector has the potential to play a greater role in Australian R&D investment. The private sector concentres on marketable technologies like those related to seeds or chemicals that are more likely to generate additional profits. However, growth in private sector investment is not guaranteed and will depend on both the expected return on R&D investment and the international competitiveness of our R&D providers. \r\n\r\n Extending the ideas  \r\n\r\n• Getting innovations out of the laboratory and in to the field and factory is also essential to lift producer efficiency. Total rural extension funding is estimated at $316 million in 2014-15. Just under half of this funding was provided by the private sector through farm advisors to boost farm profitability. \r\n",

Male fiddler crabs of the species Uca mjoebergi typically have an enlarged yellow claw which they use for fighting and attracting a mate using a waving action. \n\nExperiments were conducted between Sept 03' to Jan '04 in the vicinity of the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT. \n\nThe experiment was designed to demonstrate the use of claw colouration as a species recognition signal in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. To test this, females were given a choice between size-matched, and handed matched U.signata and U.mjoebergi males. The colour of the males claw was manipulated using Dulux Tinytin gloss enamel paint.\n\nClaw colour was found to be the dominant morphological feature in identifying conspecific males in U.mjoebergi.\n\nMeasurements taken during every trial included: carapace size (males and females), treatment (males), claw size (males), claw side (males), number of trials, trial arrangement, and female choice.",

The upper 140cm of the core was used in this study and was composed of very fine yellow-brown coloured clay. The sediments are slightly laminated, indicative of a low energy deposition regime. The core also shows 'black specks' in different concentrations, which is indicative of the appearance of a darker, non-carbonate fraction.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~6 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1991. For each day of sampling three resources are provided in the compressed (zipped) folder: 1) A map showing the location of each sampling station, 2) A word document providing vertically averaged CTD data over depth bins of 4m, and 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected, as well as coordinates of the stations.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "title": "Social monogamy in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis: The response of paired crabs when faced with intruders of differing sex",
    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November-January in 2002-2006. \n\n15 male-female pairs were located and the burrow of the male or the female (in a random order) was blocked. We tethered a size-matched same-sex or opposite sex intruder (in a random order) half way between the burrows. Once the focal individual emerged we documented whether it pushed or grappled (fought) with the intruder within 5 minutes. After each trail, we unblocked the burrow and allowed the pair to interact normally for 10 minutes before running the next trail. In this way we observed the reactions of both pair members to same- and opposite-sex intruders. Therefore for each pair, 4 experiments were undertaken: original female vs. intruder female, original female vs. intruder male, original male vs. intruder male, original male vs. intruder female.   \n\nThe results indicated that males and females were equally likely to respond aggressively to intruders of the same sex. Both were less likely  to fight intruders of the opposite sex.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the Winter period between June 1989 to August 1989. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This publication summarises the forecasts presented in the December 2016 editions of ABARES Australian crop report and Agricultural commodities as well as material from an ABARES report on productivity in the Australian grains industry released in October 2016. \r\n\r\n This publication was commissioned by the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC). \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n\r\n World indicator prices of wheat and coarse grains are forecast to fall in 2016-17 as a result of expected plentiful supplies globally. In contrast, world oilseeds indicator prices are forecast to rise because of a fall in supplies in the early part of 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were generally in very good condition at the end of winter. Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tTotal area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tThe cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth--at 1.8 per cent--of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity growth include larger machinery and cropping equipment, new plant varieties, better water management and a better understanding of harvesting and planting strategies.

    "description": "Analysing the economic potential of forestry for carbon sequestration under alternative carbon price paths  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n The introduction of a carbon price under the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) may be effective in promoting afforestation in Australia and contribute to Australia's emissions target through carbon sequestration. Rates of sequestration will depend on the stringency of the emissions reduction target, and hence the level of the carbon price. However, the rate of afforestation arising because of the carbon price may potentially affect the attractiveness of agricultural land use activities in Australia. In general, higher carbon prices are expected to decrease the profitability and attractiveness of other land use activities, such as agriculture, in favour of timber plantations and environmental plantings which generate carbon credits under the CPRS. \r\n\r\n ABARE has been commissioned by the Commonwealth Treasury to estimate the potential increase in afforestation activity on agricultural land under four hypothetical scenarios and a reference case. The key assumptions underlying ABARE estimates are described in some detail in this report. Assumptions relating to the cost of investment of afforestation and the area of land available for switching are important determinants of the land use conversion. Afforestation activity is assumed to include the establishment of commercial plantations and environmental plantings between 2007 and 2100. ",

    "description": "In recent years the term 'enhanced greenhouse effect' has become well known in modern society and yet aspects of this possible 'future climate' are poorly understood. The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. From core MD032607 the annual mean SST (Tmean) indicates a temperature range of 9oC±0.84oC between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to MIS 5, representing the largest sea surface temperature (SST) transition from a glacial to interglacial. The results also suggest that there is more stratification in the water column during interglacial periods as opposed to glacials. Conversely, temperatures gradients are reduced during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and MIS 6 suggesting a well mixed homogenised mixed layer.",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ### \r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nAs at 15 December 2017, over 48,500 registered charities had submitted their 2016 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2016 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key issues  • There has been a generally favourable start to the 2016-17 winter crop season, especially in Western Australia. Seasonal conditions have been more varied in the eastern states but there was timely above average rainfall in late autumn and early winter in these states. \r\n• According to the latest three-month rainfall outlook (June to August 2016) issued by the Bureau of Meteorology on 26 May 2016, winter rainfall is likely to be above average in most cropping regions. \r\n• The total area planted to winter crops in Australia is forecast to increase by around 1 per cent in 2016-17 to 22.3 million hectares. The area planted to canola, oats and some pulses is forecast to increase. However, the area planted to wheat and barley is forecast to decline, reflecting more favourable expected returns from growing other crops. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2016-17 to 42.3 million tonnes, which largely reflects a forecast increase in average yields. \r\n• Harvesting of 2015-16 summer crops is now largely complete. Total Australian summer crop production is estimated to have fallen by 13 per cent in 2015-16 to 3.7 million tonnes, largely because of a fall in rice production\r\n",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 3. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "title": "Riparian Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1,\" and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTskin L3S product for 1 month of consecutive day-time periods, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 1 month average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

All data records include sampling time (UCT), position (Latitude, Longitude) and water depth (under keel).\n\nData are recorded at 10 second intervals.  Data are measured with a Seabird SBE21 thermosalinograph and Wetlabs ECO-FLNTU chlorophyll fluorometer/turbidity sensor.  The turbidity data (NTU) are currently regarded as provisional in the absence of local validation due to intermittent bubble contamination.  The sampling intakes are located at depths of 1.9m (RV Cape Ferguson) and 2.8m (RV Solander).",

It is changed from time to time due to social, economic and environmental reasons. The Territory Plan is used to manage development, in particular the way in which land is used and what can be built. It is used in assessment of development applications and to guide the development of new estate areas (future urban land). Land in the ACT is divided into sections and blocks.

    "description": "AFSA publish provisional quarterly and annual personal insolvency statistics on bankruptcies, debt agreements and personal insolvency agreements for all states and territories. \r\n\r\nBankruptcy is a process where people who cannot pay their debts become bankrupt to receive the protection of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and their estate is administered by a trustee. It allows for the fair distribution of property among creditors and the prosecution of dishonest debtors.\r\n\r\nA debt agreement is an arrangement between a person who cannot pay their debts and their creditors. It is a formal arrangement under Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act. A debt agreement results from creditors voting to accept a proposal from a debtor to settle their debts. To be eligible to propose a debt agreement, a debtor must be insolvent and meet threshold levels relating to unsecured debts and assets and after-tax income.\r\n\r\nPersonal insolvency agreement (PIA): under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act, a personal insolvency agreement results from creditors accepting a debtor’s proposal to settle his or her debts. Unlike debt agreements, personal insolvency agreements are not subject to income, asset or debt thresholds.\r\n\r\nPlease see our guide to learn more about the provisional personal insolvency statistics (https://www.afsa.gov.au/resources/statistics/provisional-bankruptcy-and-personal-insolvency-statistics/guide-to-provisional-personal-insolvency-activity-statistics).\r\n",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP2, a 6m steel pole which has been installed within the lagoon of Lizard Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef. The sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of Lizard Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on Lizard Island.\n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions.\n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Lizard Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on Heron Island (southern GBR), One Tree Island (near by) and Orpheus Island (central GBR). A light sensor is also located on the Island itself to give measures of PAR.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 2. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from the N-S transect, running from Red Point in the north, to Bristol Point in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nFor each day of sampling two resources are provided in a compressed (zipped) folder: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.  For a number of sampling days a third resource is offered, providing vertically averaged CTD data over 4m depth bins.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 1 day average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

    "description": "In recent years the term 'enhanced greenhouse effect' has become well known in modern society and yet aspects of this possible 'future climate' are poorly understood. The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. At a core site off Western Australia (MD002361, 113.477166 E, 22.082 S) the highest annual SST estimate (Tmean) of 29.1oC ± 0.84oC was recorded during MIS 5, 1.6oC warmer than the modern recorded Tmean. Most interglacial periods were equivalent or warmer than present apart from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7. The most extreme glacial to interglacial transition was from the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6) to the last interglacial (MIS 5) with a temperature range of 8.7oC ± 0.84oC. The mixed layer is also thinner during interglacial periods compared to the glacial periods.",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU beef industry, world biofuel policies and the South American wine industry. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 6.1 per cent to around $60.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 4.2 per cent increase to $56.7 billion in 2015-16. At this forecast level the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 16 per cent higher than the average of $52 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to decrease by 2.2 per cent to $28.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 14.7 per cent to $31.7 billion in 2016-17. This reflects forecast increases in the gross value of horticulture and cotton production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to increase by 6.7 per cent to $47.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.4 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.6 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2016-17 are wheat (up 25 per cent), wool (3 per cent), sugar (23 per cent), wine (3 per cent), barley (15 per cent), cotton (56 per cent), chickpeas (74 per cent), lamb (4 per cent), canola (33 per cent) and rock lobster (6 per cent). \r\n• The forecast increases in export earnings are expected to be partly offset by forecast falls in beef and veal (down 17 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (17 per cent) and mutton (12 per cent). Export earnings for dairy products are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 3.4 per cent to $1.6 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7.1 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US75 cents in 2016-17, slightly higher than the average of US73 cents in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU beef industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers and importers of beef. Access to the EU market is controlled by strict animal health requirements and various quotas, which limit the amount of beef that can be imported. \r\n• As the European Union is a high value market for beef, improved access for Australia from a free trade agreement would likely lead to increased exports to this market. \r\n\r\n Oils ain't oils  \r\n• Biofuel policies in some of the world's largest biofuel producing economies have the potential to affect returns to Australian agricultural exports such as canola, sugar and coarse grains. \r\n• This article looks at recent developments in the world's leading biofuel producers and consumers (the United States, European Union and Brazil) and discusses the expected impact on world commodity prices in 2016-17 and the high-level implications for agricultural commodities in the medium term. \r\n South American wine industry  \r\n• South America is a major world producer and exporter of wine, accounting for almost 14 per cent of world production. Wine exports from South America have increased markedly in the past 15 years and its wine increasingly competes in Australia's major and emerging export markets. \r\n• This article focuses on the development of the Argentine and Chilean wine industries, with a focus on their competitiveness with Australian wine exports. \r\n",

    "description": "Fiddler crabs are often spectacularly coloured and capable of dramatic colour changes. While the adaptive significance of variation resulting from short- or long-term colour changes is generally well known, the phenotypic diversity in colour pattern between individuals is often neglected. To fully understand the development and function of colour pattern variation, it is necessary to first describe its morphological basis and the naturally occurring diversity. - NB Colour pattern refers to the configuration of any coloured areas on the black carapace, regardless of their spectral composition. \n\nDuring this experiment 276 fiddler crabs of the species Uca capricornis were photographed - 117 females and 159 males. Using these pictures and a host of software programs, images were constructed that illustrate the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs, including males and females in general, and males and females with various size classes; <8mm, 8-9.9mm, 10-11.9mm, 12-13.9mm, 14-15.9mm, 16-17.9mm, and males >18mm (no photographed females were >18mm).   These images are the equivalent of an average crab's colour pattern. \n\nTo more clearly illustrate the variation in colour pattern between the groups, similar images were constructed using the standard deviation of crabs coloured at each coordinate (1mm x 1mm square).",

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2015 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for a charity’s 2015 reporting year. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2014 – 30 June 2015, for others it will be the 2015 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2015 reporting period. \r\n\r\nSome charities report to the ACNC as part of a reporting group. The 2015 AIS information for these charities is attached as a separate dataset on this page. Any analysis of AIS data should include those charities as well.  \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS collects information about charity finances. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a network of researchers who are interested in the sector, and hold regular teleconferences. If you are interested in becoming involved in the Research network, please [email us](research@acnc.gov.au). The ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "\nThis layer contains information on the distribution and vegetation types of High Country Sphagnum Bogs and Fens in the ACT as defined by Nature Conservation (High Country Bogs and Associated Fens) Conservation Advice 2019 (Nature Conservation Act). The dataset includes areas of RAMSAR significance. The threatened Northern Corroboree Frogs are also associated with these ecosystems. Veg mapping was undertaken by Geoff Hope et al in 2009 and later revisited during mapping of ACT Vegetation Communities in 2015-2018 (Baines et al 2018).\nThe ACT Scientific Committee determined that the ecological community High Country Bogs and Associated Fens is eligible for inclusion in the ACT Threatened Ecological Communities List in 2019. Most ACT High Country Bogs and Associated Fens communities are consistent with the nationally listed Alpine Sphagnum Bogs and Associated Fens ecological community.\nThe mountains of the Australian Capital Territory support substantial areas of peat-forming mires in interfluves and valley heads, as well as areas of riparian fen vegetation along streams. While similar fens and bogs occur in the Snowy Mountains, the ACT represents a significant outlier of major biogeographic significance because the mires are near their climatic limits and hence sensitive to climate change.\nMapping of the mires was originally completed by Hope et al 2009. The mapping was developed in three stages using orthorectified aerial photography and satellite imagery and extensive field checking.

However, these areas were originally mapped by Hope et al 2009 with high altitude sphagnum bog (HSB) present.\nFor more information on ACT High Country Bogs and Fens, visit <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens</a>\nUpdates: Majority of the mapping was completed post 2003 fires. However, the dataset is was updated using Near Infrared Imagery 2015 and LiDAR data in 2019. Further updates will be implemented as required if new or better mapping of bog and fen areas become available.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:3,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for showing presence of bogs and fens in the ACT. Exact boundaries and extents will contract and expand throughout time. This should be considered if data use purpose requires accuracy of greater than 50m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors. © ACT Government",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

Core MD 032607 was obtained in 2003 off the coast of Sumatra (36.9606 S, 137.4065 E). By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information regarding past oceanographic and climatic systems. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile of the core (revealing sedimentation rates), the relative abundance of planktonic foraminifera over time, and estimates of historical sea-surface temperatures.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Dart Point in the east, to Callala Beach(S) in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 6 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "A 6m steel pole has been installed within a small bommie within Second Lagoon of One Tree Island as part of the sensor network infrastructure at One Tree Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef off Gladstone, Australia. \n\nThe sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of One Tree Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on One Tree Island. \n\nThe pole is initially configured with a single thermistor string with six thermistors that is located down the outer wall of the bommie into the second lagoon and so provides a temperature profile of the second lagoon of One Tree Island. The data is collected every 10 minutes and relayed via the base station to the Data Centre at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).\n\nThe system uses a Campbell Scientific logger into which the sensors are connected. The equipment is serviced every six months with plans to install additional instruments such as pressure and salinity. The pole is available for mounting of additional third part instruments and so forms an infrastructure to support future observational work at the Island.",

    "description": "Version 2 minor revision 27 June 2024.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest compilation of land use mapping information for Australia’s regions as at December 2023. The land use data are supported by a supplementary commodities dataset, containing extra information on the location of select predominantly agricultural commodities. These datasets replace the previous 2020 December updates. \r\nVersion 2 fixes issues caused during the conversion of the state vector datasets to rasters, where single pixel horizontal lines were generated in local areas. This does not affect the date or scale of mapping.\r\n\r\nThese data were compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs and other authoritative sources through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). These datasets are not recommended for change analysis or for national land use statistics—instead use the Land use of Australia 2010-11 to 2015-16.\r\n\r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n\r\nA seamless raster dataset that combines land use vector data for all state and territory jurisdictions, at a spatial resolution of 50 by 50 metres.\r\nShows a single dominant land use for each location, based on the management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies).\r\nUpdates have been made to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, the capital city of Adelaide, parts of the Great Barrier Reef NRM regions, and national updates to select horticultural tree crops and protected cropping structures. There are also minor corrections to Western Australia, and more accurate representation of mining areas in South Australia.  \r\nThe date of mapping (2008 to 2023) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary and are provided as supporting datasets. \r\nProduced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. \r\nRefer to the metadata and ABARES website for additional information.\r\n \r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n- Provides location, extent and year verified for 185 commodities, where mapped, as a vector dataset. \r\n- Commodity data are validated in the field and using other sources.\r\n- Generally, a single commodity is shown at a location reflecting the most recent date that location was verified.\r\n- The location of a commodity may change on a seasonal to annual basis, depending on factors such as climate, markets or farming systems.\r\n- Not nationally complete or comprehensive, and with various dates of capture (1967 to 2023) and input mapping products (2014 to 2023). \r\n- Refer to the metadata for additional information.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n- Land use: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 version 2, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, June, CC BY 4.0, DOI: 10.25814/2w2p-ph98\r\n- Commodities: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "Report produced in collaboration between Universities and Commonwealth and State Government agencies.  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  provide national assessments of the status of key wild-capture fish stocks. The reports provide scientifically based stock status assessments for 68 key species (or species complexes), which cumulatively contribute over 90 percent of the value and 85 percent of the volume from Australian fisheries. \r\n• Stock status assessments in the 2014 reports are based on the abundance and level of harvest in 2013. In total, 238 stocks were assessed across the 68 key species; 129 stocks were classified as sustainable, these contribute around 87.5 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. There were 7 stocks classified as transitional-recovering, 19 as transitional-depleting, 11 as overfished and 4 as environmentally limited. There were 68 stocks where status was classified as undefined; these stocks contribute 6.4 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  focus on the status of targeted fish stocks. The status classifications do not consider broader ecosystem impacts of fishing, such as bycatch or habitat impacts, or social and economic considerations. These elements may be included in future editions, or companion reports. \r\n• The reports rely on a consistent national reporting framework that was developed collaboratively by fisheries scientists from around Australia. The framework provides transparency and consistency in stock status reporting across jurisdictions. \r\n• The Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  builds on the 2012 inaugural edition with 19 new species. Four of the new species are caught in Commonwealth fisheries. The additional species were nominated by the states and the Northern Territory as either iconic species that are likely to be seen in retail outlets or historically overfished species. \r\n• There were minor alterations to the national stock status classification framework and species chapters. The main update to the framework is the inclusion of the new environmentally limited stock category. The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  Advisory Group included this additional category to describe stocks depleted below the limit reference point by environmental factors rather than fishing. \r\n• Between 2012 and 2014 there have been a number of changes to stock structure and stock status for some species. In both cases the changes are based on the most recent and reliable information available. \r\n• The reports were developed collaboratively by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) and government fishery research agencies from all states, the Northern Territory and the CSIRO; more than 100 fisheries researchers were involved. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for December 1988. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",
