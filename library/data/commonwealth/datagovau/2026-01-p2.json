    "title": "Parent Record: Social monogamy in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis",
    "description": "Fiddler crabs are not generally considered subjects for the study of monogamy as they tend to live in dense mixed sex colonies with numerous neighbours and individually defended territories. Here, a series of experiments have been conducted demonstrating the unique relationship between neighbouring males and females in the species Uca capricornis. These experiments illustrate that this species of fiddler crab is socially monogamous. Six experiments were conducted in relation to this investigation in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from November to January in 2002-2006: \n\n1) Natural male-female interactions and territoriality - Twenty-one pairs were filmed from overhead for a period of 30 minutes. Any activity was noted, as was any interactions with intruders. Territoriality was also examined, providing the overall area covered by the crabs within the half hour. By aligning the male and female territories with their respective burrows it was possible to determine the area overlap between them. \n\n2) Sex ratio and distribution - The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether females may be a limited resource within a population of Uca capricornis. The sex ratio in relation to size was determined. The location of burrows was also recorded to determine whether the males and females were distributed independently of each other. The distance to, and sex of, the nearest resident for each individual was also measured to compare mean distances between male-female neighbours and between male-male neighbours.\n\n3) Burrow tenure -To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. \n\n4) 'Neighbour' and 'stranger' relations - This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed.\n\n5) Response of paired crabs when faced with intruders of differing sex. This experiment was designed to determine if males and females are unable to associate with multiple partners because their partners aggressively repel same-sex intruders. \n\n6) Size-assortative mating -This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. This investigation was based upon data collected during the other experiments.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset contains the hydrochemical and environmental tracer data of a fortnightly time series and event-driven precipitation data between October 2019 and March 2021 created as part of the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program (GBA) stage 3 in the Beetaloo Sub-basin. A total of 28 spring samples were collected and analysed for a number of parameters including hydrochemistry (major and minor ions) and the environmental tracers 222Rn, 18O, 2H. Samples are from Bitter Spring (2 locations), Rainbow Spring and Fig Tree Spring at Mataranka. Further 19 rainwater samples were taken at the ranger station in Mataranka and analysed for 18O & 2H. The data showed the variability of Fig-Tree Spring indicating that part of the water discharging is sourced from a swampy upstream area and flows to the spring along a short flow distance. Bitter Spring and Rainbow Spring show steady values hardly influenced by seasons and therefore have mean residence times above 4-5years. Significant values of helium above solubility equilibrium also indicate the presence of an older component, probably circulating on the time scale of centuries.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSamples were taken by Mataranka Rangers and sent by post to CSIRO Waite Campus, Adelaide for 222Rn measurement and to CDU in Darwin for 18O, 2H and hydrochemistry measurement. Alkalinity was measured by titration. Stable isotopes 2H and 18O of water were measured on a Picarro Cavity-Ring Down Laser Spectrometer, are calibrated versus VSMOW and given in the usual delta notation. Anions were measured by ion chromatography and cations by ICP-OES. Radon extraction followed the procedure outlined in Leaney & Herczeg (2006) and measurements were done using Liquid Scintillation Spectroscopy on a Quantulus Counter. Data are reported as measured without further post-processing.",

    "title": "Farm-to-retail price spread and farm share in food supply chains: Background paper",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report examines Australian and international experience in monitoring farmgate and retail prices for food products. It also outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The food retail sector in Australia is highly concentrated while there is increasing consolidation in the food processing sector. There is some concern that this could lead to farmers receiving lower prices and consumers paying higher prices than would be the case in a perfectly competitive market. \r\n• The paper reviews local and international research in monitoring movements in farm and retail prices for food products, outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n• The review of international research found significant variation across countries in the importance they place on food price monitoring and analysis. Research has consistently found that the more processed food products are, the lower the farm share, and that farm shares have generally been declining over time. \r\n• The review also found that the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS) is a world leader in analysing prices in food supply chains. The paper outlines a relatively simple methodology used by the USDA ERS to monitor changes in farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products. \r\n• While there are limitations with the USDA ERS approach, an increase in farm-to-retail price spread or a decrease in farm share of the retail price could be a useful early indicator that competition issues are emerging within a supply chain. However, additional analysis will always be required to confirm whether the cause was an increase in market power because these changes can occur for a number of reasons, including differences in productivity in different sectors or input prices increasing at a faster rate in the retail sector than in the farm sector. Unfortunately, there is generally a lack of data that will allow a breakdown in marketing costs to facilitate this analysis. \r\n• One option for additional research is to replicate another methodology developed by the USDA ERS, which uses input-output data to decompose costs and profits between different sectors within a supply chain and to estimate returns to primary factors, including capital and labour. This type of analysis would be more expensive than the high-level analysis described in this paper but it would also be more informative than the farm share/price spread analysis in identifying the range of factors influencing prices, and lead to a more informed debate about the various factors influencing prices, including market power. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a sample of the Heat Health Vulnerability Index (HHVI) from the Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project. It includes all SA1s within a single SA2 region in New South Wales (NSW).\nThis dataset provides a spatial indicator of population vulnerability to extreme heat at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1), developed as part of the Heat Health Vulnerability case study within the AusUrb-HI project. The indicator captures three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It integrates demographic profiles, environmental conditions, and urban morphology to map areas most at risk of heat-related health impacts. A comprehensive description of the methodology and outcomes is available in this report.\nThe AusUrb-HI project, led by AURIN, brings together expertise from QUT, RMIT, and UWA. It aims to enhance the understanding of urban health through spatial data assets across three themes: Cancer Determinants, Heat Health Vulnerability, and Urban Liveability &amp; Health. These indicators are designed to inform health professionals, planners, and policymakers in delivering targeted, climate-sensitive strategies to improve health and resilience in urban environments.\nThis dataset focuses on the NSW case study area, where linked hospital admissions data enabled validation of the HHVI. The index was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) on up to 44 input variables, with results produced for both the 2016 and 2021 census years. Multiple downscaling methods were tested, showing high internal consistency and strong correlation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD).\nThe linked health data used for validation was accessed through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) and analyzed in the Secure Unified Research Environment (SURE).\nThis dataset is intended to support evidence-based planning for climate resilience and public health. Each record includes values for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and the combined index, along with variables used to derive these indices.",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) R.V. Tangaroa collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during its voyages in Sub-Antarctic. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to New Zealand daily. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

The Albury FMP deals with the city as a whole.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nInterpretation of data on maps 522 and 528 and AusAEM maps. Within the Beetaloo GBA region, areas with higher potential for recharge to the Cambrian Limestone aquifer are those with the following conditions: A. Carpentaria Basin cover is thin, B. Carpentaria B sequence consists primarily of Carpentaria A sandstone, and C. there are areas with sinkholes at surface and other collapse features. These conditions are met in NW corner of Beetaloo GBA region. Areas with potential for recharge to Carpentaria Basin A sandstone aquifer, may occur where the Carpentaria Basin sandstone is partially saturated. Indirectly this may be a source of recharge to the underlying CLA as well. This area occurs in southern parts of the Beetaloo GBA region, where the Caprentaria sandstone is utilised as an aquifer.The rest of the  eastern Beetaloo probably has lower potential for recharge as Carpentaria Basin sediments tend to be dominated by clay and black shale, and can be very thick.  These areas need to be double checked against longterm water level data to confirm if any recharge is occurring.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nProduced by interpreting Caprentaria thickness and sinkhole maps (see factsheet 5 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba for more  details).  Polygons were generated in ArcGIS from visual interpretation and stored in shapefile format.",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

    "description": "\n\n\nThis digital soil landscape product contains natural resource mapping for the Australian Capital Territory. The project was completed by the Office of Environment and Heritage (NSW). The project was funded by the ACT Government to enhance knowledge of soils, landscapes and physical constraints to land use in the urban and rural environment. The information will assist in informed decision making, planning and environmental modelling throughout the catchment.\n55 soil landscape map units have been described for the ACT. Each unit is an inventory of soil and landscape information with relatively uniform land management requirements, allowing major soil and landscape qualities and constraints to be identified.\nThe GIS product shown here provides location of each of the soil landscape map units - including the soil landscape code and name. For more detailed information please see the full soil landscape reports for each unit, as well as the final report (see datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au). Detailed spreadsheets can be used to join more detailed information to the GIS also available on request.\nLineage:\nThe mapping undertaken by the NSW Government was created using:<ul><li>\nexisting published soil landscape mapping (Canberra and Michelago 1:100,000 map sheets);</li><li>\nnew soil landscape mapping (part Brindabella and Tantangara 1:100,000 map sheets).</li></ul>\nFor all datasets, provisional soil landscapes were established firstly on the dominant geomorphic processes responsible for the formation of the landscape and secondly on the geological parent material. Elevation, aspect, vegetation patterns and human disturbance were other factors considered when defining units. \nFor existing mapping, the boundaries of these provisional soil landscapes were mapped using stereoscopic interpretation of 1:40,000 scale black and white and 1:25,000 scale colour aerial photographs (Canberra) and 1:40,000 scale black and white aerial photographs only for Michelago. LANDSAT thematic mapper and radiometric imagery were used to assist with perception and charting of provisional soil landscapes. These boundaries were transferred onto 1:25 000 topographic base maps. After field checking boundaries and detailed investigations of the soil, the provisional landscapes were confirmed, amalgamated or sub-divided.\nFor new mapping on the Brindabella and Tantangara sheets, the boundaries were captured by digitizing directly to screen at around 1:10,000 scale using ArcGIS. Ultra-high resolution (10 cm) aerial photographic imagery provided a base layer during the capture process. In addition the following data were used to assist delineate soil landscapes boundaries: ADS digital aerial imagery, radiometric imagery, SPOT 5 satellite imagery, climate data, 1 second DSM and DEM elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 1:100,000 scale geological mapping, 1:25,000 topographic maps and DTDB digital terrain models.\nSoils have been examined and described in detail at over 500 sites in the ACT. This includes 79 new detailed sites to fill data gaps for this project. At each site, soil morphological data and site information were recorded on Soil and Land Information System (SALIS) cards or digitally collected via the eDIRT field data collection system. Sufficient field work was undertaken within each soil landscape to identify the range of soils present and to enable their distribution within the landscape to be described. To best knowledge none of the sites were randomly sampled. Sample intervals were selected to be morphologically representative examples of each soil material present in each type profile i.e. soil horizons.\nA comprehensive suite of soil tests have been analysed for many of the representative type soil profiles within the ACT.\nA desktop review of published soil landscape units has occurred resulting in some minor amendments to the existing linework.\nPositional Accuracy:\nObservations and soil profiles were located using handheld GPS or using 1:25,000 topographic maps. Soil boundaries on this 1:100,000 scale map product is generally accurate to within 100 m on the ground but variations will occur especially where soil boundaries are gradual. The scale of use of this dataset is 1:100,000.\nAttribute Accuracy:\nSoil landscape map units are defined by unique combinations of soil type, topography, geology, native vegetation, land use, existing erosion/land degradation and constraints to development. The land and soil attributes in this product were mainly assessed using field observations, remote sensing interpretation (satellite, radiometric and aerial photos) and laboratory analysis of dominant soil type profiles.\nLogical Consistency:\nMap unit concepts and polygons, major soil types and soil landscape descriptions have been field verified by a peer soil scientist for many map units especially in published mapping areas and accessible terrain. All units have some level of field investigation and checking. ArcGIS was used to ensure all polygons in the shape file are topologically correct. All polygons have a unique identifier.\nCompleteness:\nAll polygons in the GIS layer are labeled with a soil landscape MasterCode and MasterName. PDF reports and spreadsheet data have been supplied for each map unit.\nAdditional Metadata:\nSoil Landscape of the Michelago 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-michelago-1-100000-sheet54b12</a>\nSoil Landscape of the Canberra 1:100 000 sheet metadata <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au:443/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf\">https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/soil-landscapes-of-the-canberra-1-100000-sheet07dcf</a>\nSoil Landscapes of the Australian Capital Territory project report:\nCook, W., Jenkins, B., Young, M., Murphy, C., Milford H.B. and Muller, R.

Groundwater samples are assigned to the following hydrostratigraphic units: Antrim Plateau Volcanics/Helen Springs/Jindare, Bukalara, Cenozoic, Cretaceous, Jinduckin/AnthonyLagoon/HookerCreek; Proterozoic and Tindall/GumRidge/Montejinni.\r\nVariables used for the analysis included major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO3, Cl, SO4), electrical conductivity (EC) and pH with data normalised for statistical calculation. Datapoints with charge balance error above 10% have been removed prior to interpretation. The interpretation resulted in five clusters with distinct geochemical properties, as described in the respective section of the technical report Hydrogeology of the Beetaloo GBA region.\r\nCheck column source to identify data origin with references in the above mentioned report.",

    "description": "Since the peak of the Millennium drought, the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) has seen large increases in nut and cotton plantings, decreases in water supply due to environmental water recovery and tighter limits on water trade between regions. These changes have raised concerns about how the water market might cope under drought conditions. \r\n\r\n In this study, ABARES applies an economic model of the sMDB to simulate what would happen to the water market under a repeat of the Millennium drought, with current water demand, environmental water recovery, trade limits and carryover rules. These scenarios provide an indication of future water prices and trade patterns across the sMDB under a repeat of historical climate conditions (for the period 2002-03 to 2016-17). \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n• Modelling results suggest that under a repeat of historical conditions allocation water prices in the sMDB would rise no higher than the peaks observed during the previous drought. \r\n• Whilst demand for water has increased for cotton and almonds, this has been more than offset by reductions in demand in other industries particularly, grazing, dairy and rice. \r\n• Improvements in carryover rules will help to limit price rises under a repeat of the drought, with much larger volumes of water being stored between years. \r\n• Trade limits will likely be binding more often in the future, partly due to the changes in water demand. \r\n• While water price peaks are simulated to be no higher under a repeat of extreme drought conditions, they are higher on average, due in part to environmental water recovery. The modelling suggests a change in the distribution of prices, with fewer years of low prices.\r\n",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis V7 database has been updated to include the Receptor data from Clarence-Moreton assessment team. The relevant tables of ReceptorList and tbl_Receptors and the spatial data of  GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt  were added to this version. The Clarence-Moreton Asset database v7 supersedes the previous version of the Asset database only in Receptor relevant tables/ feature class (i.e. ReceptorList, tbl_Receptors and GM_CLM_ReceptorList_pt ).\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v7  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150916.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150916_GISOnly.gdb), the draft Receptor Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-140-ReceptorRegister-V20150916.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150916.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.

    "description": "The purpose of the experiment was to quantitatively examine the colour changes associated with moulting in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin between Nov - Jan (04/05 & 05/06). \n\nCircular cages were constructed on the mud flat and characteristically marked crabs were introduced. In total 11 females and 10 males were photographed through at least one moult.\n\nOn average, U. capricornis grow 1.6mm with every moult. With every successive moult the carapace pattern contracts and becomes more distinct, especially in males. In addition to the considerable variation in pattern, both sexes also vary in the specific colour of their spots. Colour changes are associated with moulting and, as with pattern, tend to follow a certain progression.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis data set comprises the  inputs, parameters and outputs of the OGIA groundwater models as used for BA groundwater modelling reported in the product 2.6.2 of Maranoa-Balonne-Condamine subregion. Only one input file (MODFLOW drain package input file) was modified for the BA specific model runs. This input file is provided within the folder named NIC_MBC_Model_Input_files. All other model inputs are the same as is used in the OGIA model runs for Underground water Impact Report 2012. These inputs may be requested from Office of Groundwater Impact Assessment and is not published in the BA repository as per the agreement with OGIA.\n\nThe OGIA drain package has been modified to include the boundary conditions caused by 7 mines in the MBC subregion. For this  a python script was written. The script reads the original drain package file (ASCII file) of OGIA model and then write additional drain cells to the file at the locations of the 7 mines - Commodore, newAcland stage 2, Wilkie Creek, Kogan Creek, Cameby Downs, New Acland stage 3 and The Range. The script reads the locations of these mines from input files - .dat  (to the script) with names similar to the mine names. The locations of the mines are specified as rows and columns of the model grid in these input files. These files also have the elevations of the drain cells (bottom/centre of the cells in the Walloon Coal Measures in which the coal mine pit is present). The location and elevation data were obtained from OGIA  and is registered as a separate data set. \n\nTwo copies of the  python script are present in the folder corresponding to the baseline and CRDP drain packages.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nAll the model input data files were obtained from OGIA with the condition that these will not be published. The drain package input file and all output files were generated by CSIRO Land and Water by using CSIRO generated scripts and by running the model using these inputs. The drain package has inputs from the original OGIA model drain pakcage and additional data obtained from OGIA and coal mine footprint data. \n\n\n\nThe coal mine footprint data sets is registered as a separate data set.

    "description": "####_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._####\r\n\r\n### Background ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information. \r\n\r\n### 2020 AIS data ###\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2020 AIS information lodged by multiple charities. \r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2020 AIS data. This report - the 8th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on [our website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/tools/reports/australian-charities-report-8th-edition).\r\n\r\n### Interpreting AIS data ###\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au).\r\n\r\n### Withheld information ###\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n### More ACNC data ###\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. \r\n",

    "title": "Wolumba Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and covers the northern part of the suburb of Chester\nHill. It is an urban catchment that drains through a stormwater pipe network in a north-easterly\ndirection to the Parramatta Council Local Government Area (LGA). The Wolumba catchment is one\nof the sub catchments of Duck River, and is wholly within the north western section of Bankstown City\nCouncil (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 160 stormwater pits and 220 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Wolumba Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix B.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix B.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the current Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of national land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for application to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature conservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved tenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. This pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 5. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors as well as a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "A series of 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 8. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n This study examined the features of Australian wild dog management groups, particularly in terms of landholder participation and collaboration, to identify what helps or hinders the groups in achieving coordinated and effective wild dog management. The study was based on interviews with representatives from 30 groups across Australia. \r\n\r\n This work was undertaken as part of a broader ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n\r\n The study found that as well as reduced losses from wild dog attacks, the operations of many groups have resulted in more strategic and targeted control actions and better communication between neighbours. Wild dog management groups function as important social networks that help farming communities cope with the detrimental effects of wild dogs. The report makes suggestions about the support that groups may need in future to achieve wild dog management. \r\n\r\n The study findings have been used in the design of a national landholder survey on wild dog management, which ABARES conducted in late 2014.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nContains the files and R scripts used for creating interpolated surfaces of depth to groundwater and contour maps of piezometric surfaces for dry (200 - 2007) and wet (2008 - 2012) periods in the Bremer, Clarence Lockyer, Logan-Albert and Richmond alluvial systems.  Piezometric surfaces and depth to groundwater surfaces are created using ordinary kriging in R.  The data used come from the bores in the QLD and NSW groundwater databases (see data lineage).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGroundwater hydraulic head data from the NSW and QLD databases (see data lineage) was extracted by selecting only those data collected between 2000 and 2012 and that fell within the boundary shapefiles for the alluvial bodies.  Elevation data from the DEM was appended to the spatial locations for each groundwater bore in the dataset.  Ordinary kriging was then performed in R to create interpolated surfaces for depth to groundwater and piezometric surfaces.  The kriging makes use of the digital elevation model as a covariate for aiding prediction.  The R scripts output pdf maps of the surfaces for each of the following alluvial systems: Bremer, Clarence, Lockyer, Logan-Albert and Richmond.  Maps are produced for for the dry period (2000 - 2007) and wet period (2008 - 2012) and show the predicted surface in addition to the prediction standard deviation.\n\n\n\nThe R script also outputs the rasters used to create these maps to .asc files (ascii grids).  There are four such ascii grids for the entire alluvium: \n\n1. PiezometricSurface_Dry.asc  (the estimated piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the dry years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n2. PiezometricSurface_SD_Dry.asc (the estimated standard deviation of the piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the dry years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n3. PiezometricSurface_Wet.asc (the estimated piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the wet years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n4. PiezometricSurface_SD_Wet.asc (the estimated standard deviation of the piezometric surface for all of the alluvium in the wet years which has been clipped to shapefiles to produce each of the .pdf maps)\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) CLM - Interpolated piezometric surfaces for Alluvium.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data.

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Tenure of Australia's forests (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\nTenure of Australia's forests (2013) v2.0 is a continental dataset of tenure classified into national forest tenure classes:  Multiple Use Public Forest, Nature Conservation Reserves, Other Crown Land, Leasehold, Private Freehold and Unresolved Tenure.  The dataset combines forest cover with land tenure information. \r\n\r\n The forest cover information was sourced from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0  dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset, reclassified in order to align the national forest types and national forest categories of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) forest cover dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013). \r\n\r\n The land tenure information was sourced from the commercially available Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) CADLite and Tenure datasets, and tenure data obtained from the former Forests NSW (now Forestry Corporation of NSW). The NFI - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments, whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests - used information from these sources to compile a national tenure dataset by applying a national classification to the data supplied by the states and territories to allow seamless integration. \r\n\r\n As with previous versions, this Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 dataset was produced by combining the NFI land tenure dataset with the most recent Forests of Australia dataset. The only difference between the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) and the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 is that the latter has the updated national forest cover types and new national forest categories. The underlying land tenure data is the same in both versions of the 2013 forest tenure datasets. \r\n",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n In this edition of the Australian crop report, ABARES will release its latest forecast of summer crop production in 2016-17 and its latest estimate of winter crop production in 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Planting of 2016-17 summer crops is largely completed and planted area is estimated to have increased from last year because of above average spring rainfall. However, yields of dryland summer crops are expected to be constrained by hot and dry seasonal conditions during summer. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology's latest three-month rainfall outlook suggests above average rainfall is unlikely across the major summer cropping regions in Queensland and northern New South Wales. \r\n• Harvesting of 2016-17 winter crops is now largely complete and production is estimated to have exceeded the forecast of record production presented in the December 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n",

    "description": "_Fires in Australia’s Forests 2016–21 (2024)_ is a continental spatial dataset of the extent and frequency of planned and unplanned fires occurring in forest in the five financial years between July 2016 and June 2021, assembled for _Australia's State of the Forests Report_ Indicator 3.1b Area of forest burnt by planned and unplanned fire. It was developed from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and territory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest Fire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the _Forests of Australia (2023)_ dataset (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/forest-cover), and forest tenure information sourced from the _Tenure of Australia’s Forests (2023)_ dataset.\r\n\r\nPlanned fire: Fire started in accordance with a fire management plan or planned burning program, such as fuel-reduction burning or prescribed burning.\r\n\r\nUnplanned fire: Fire started naturally (such as by lightning), accidentally, or deliberately (such as by arson), but not in accordance with planned fire management prescriptions. Also called bushfire or wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.​\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a financial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event occurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is recorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into two categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and advice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe _Fires in Australia’s forests 2016–21 (2024)_ dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's _National Forest Policy Statement_ and the _Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002_ (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.​​",

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the former  Australian fisheries surveys report. The information and analysis contained in these reports are accessed by policy makers, managers, researchers and industry. Alongside the usual detailed information about the financial performance of the average vessel and the overall economic performance of the fishery, this report also provides analysis of additional economic indicators for the Commonwealth Torres Strait Prawn Fishery (TSPF). The construction of these indicators draw upon the data collected through the fisheries survey program. Together with the financial and economic performance information, these indicators help to form a comprehensive picture of the economic performance of the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery over a number of years. \r\n\r\n This report presents results of the 2013 Torres Strait Prawn Fishery survey, comprising survey based estimates of financial and economic performance for the 2010-11 and 2011-12 financial years, as well as non-survey based estimates of economic performance for the fishery in the 2012-13 financial year. Other indicators presented in the report include the productivity index, input costs and output prices and management costs. \r\n\r\n Financial performance  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - was negative for the average vessel in the fishery in 2010-11 and 2011-12, at -$89 491 and -$87 366 respectively. \r\n• The change in profit at full equity was primarily attributed to higher cash receipts, which in turn led to higher vessel cash income and higher profit at full equity. \r\n\r\n Economic performance  \r\n• The net economic returns (including management costs) remained negative at -$2.1 million in 2010-11 and -$2.7 million in 2011-12. \r\n• In 2012-13 preliminary net economic returns were estimated at -$2.3 million using non-survey based methods. \r\n• The negative net economic returns from the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery is mainly attributed to the high costs associated with operating in a remote fishery. \r\n",

    "description": "The purpose of this data set was to compile distributional, general life-history characteristics and phylogenies for Australian tropical rain forest vertebrates to inform a wide range of comparative studies on the determinants of biodiversity patterns and to assess the impacts of global climate change. We provide three distinct data sets: (1) a table of species-specific distributional and life-history traits for 242 vertebrate species found in the rain forests of the Australian Wet Tropics; (2) species distribution maps (GIS raster files) for 202 of the species displaying both the realized and potential distributions; and (3) phylogenies for these species. These species represent 93 birds, 31 amphibians, 31 mammals (including one monotreme), and 47 reptiles. Where information exists, the distributional and life-history data compiled here present information on: indices of environmental specialization (ENFA), habitat specialization, average body mass and size, sexual dimorphism, reproductive characteristics such as age at first reproduction, clutch/litter size, number of reproductive bouts per year and breeding seasonality, longevity, time of day when most active, and dispersal ability; distributional characteristics such as range size (potential and realized for both total and core ranges) and observed ranges in temperature, precipitation, and elevation; and niche attributes such as environmental marginality and specialization. The distribution maps provided represent a combination of presence-only ecological niche modeling (using MaxEnt) to estimate the potential distribution of a species followed by biogeographic clipping by expert opinion based on extensive field data and a subregional classification relevant to the topography and biogeographic history of the region to produce best-possible estimates of the realized distribution. Our assemblage contains many species with a shared evolutionary history, and thus many analyses of these data will need to account for phylogeny. Although a comprehensive phylogeny with branch length information does not exist for this diverse group of species, we present a best-estimate composite phylogeny constructed primarily from recently published molecular phylogenies of included groups. \n\nThis metadata record is an extract from the authorive metadata records maintained by the tropical data hub (http://tropicaldatahub.org/data/6e58cda4-a2c9-4193-bb22-708e25054e3c).",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Established pests and weeds represent a high ongoing cost to Australian agriculture. The Australian Government has invested $50 million through the Australian Competitiveness White Paper to improve the way pest animals and weeds are managed and to increase the capacity of farmers to deal with these threats. This is through investment in projects that: develop new and improved control tools and technologies; improve land manager awareness and access to control tools and technologies; improve land manager knowledge of best practice pest animal and weed management; and increase land manager and community participation in pest animal and weed management activities. \r\n\r\n To enable the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to evaluate outcomes of this investment, baseline data is required to provide a national overview of the status and management of established pest animals and weeds. Currently, there is insufficient data available to establish the baseline. Therefore a national survey of agricultural land managers was undertaken to collect data on pest animal and weed status, impacts and management actions at the property and local area levels. \r\n\r\n This report presents the results of responses from 6470 agricultural land managers, representing broadacre, dairy, horticulture and other livestock industries across all natural resource management regions in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n Nearly 80 per cent of respondents were actively managing a pest animal, and 85 per cent were actively managing weeds on their property in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Shooting and ground baiting continue to be widely used tools for vertebrate pest management. Herbicide is used by 90 per cent of landholders in the management of weeds and reported as effective by the vast majority. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents reported that pest animal and weed control methods they were using were at least moderately effective. \r\n\r\n Agricultural businesses spend a significant amount on managing pest animals and weeds. An average of $19,620 was spent per agricultural business on undertaking pest animal and weed management activities. This include pest animal and weed management related expenditure on traps, baits, herbicides, pesticides/insecticides, fuel, fencing materials, and labour (including the cost of contractors) on the property in the last 12 months. \r\n• For those managing pest animals they spend an average of $7,023 per year (pest animals including feral, natives, insects and other pests (for example, parasites and mites)). \r\n• Agricultural businesses spend an average of $17,917 per year on weed management activities, this includes all activities undertaken as part of the businesses’ usual production cycle activities, for example spraying weeds before planting a crop. \r\n Pest animal and weed control activities took an average of 77 person days per agricultural business by owners/operators (including family members) and 39 person days by contractors, employees and other people (for example, volunteers) in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Nearly eight per cent of landholders were members of a pest animal or weed management group. The majority of the groups had developed a plan for coordinating management activities or collaborating with other stakeholders. \r\n\r\n A majority of land managers reported: new and improved control methods; access to information on control options and methods; more management activities by other land managers (private and public); and better access to biological controls as important actions that could improve pest animal and weed management.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for October 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital point coverage of glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each glacial sediment sample is represented as a point which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected on glacial moraine ridges and along raised beach ridges and shorelines represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on the landscape. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and  glaciation cycles within the Windmill Islands.",

Physical removal involves using hand tools, power tools or machinery to remove or change the structure of the vegetation. This usually involves removing or thinning shrubs and thinning and pruning trees. Debris created by physical removal may be piled and burnt, chipped on site or removed from the site. Physical removal is usually only undertaken in small areas, but may be undertaken more widely in areas such as pine plantations.",

    "description": "This technical annex provides a description of the quantitative economic model used in the report South America: an emerging competitor for Australia's beef industry. The report focuses on the beef industries of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Australia. There are two objectives. The first is to assess the main drivers behind growth of beef exports from each country between 2000 and 2014. The second is to project the value of beef exports between 2014 and 2030 under scenarios reflecting hypothetical and actual changes to policies and operating environments. \r\n\r\n A bilateral trade decomposition model was designed to quantify the historical drivers of beef exports from Australia and its major competitors in South America, with the aim of drawing implications for projections of future bilateral trade flows. Projections are developed for the period from 2014 to 2030 that are indicative of the prospects for both regions to expand their exports under three policy scenarios. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a18.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied. \n\n\n\nThis dataset is a GIS layer of Victorian groundwater-surface water interaction data clipped to the Gippsland region.  \n\n\n\nGroundwater generally interacts with surface water through various processes and pathways. The development of ground water often has impacts on surface streams and visa versa. The data results from an assessment of the SW-GW interaction across the study area.  The data describes GW and SW interaction in four broad classes : neutral/losing, gaining, variable and unclassified.  The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric Surface Hydrology Catchments dataset was used as the base layer for considering surface water as an asset. This dataset provided mapped major rivers for Victoria.  Numerous investigations into the interaction between groundwater and surface water have occurred across Victoria. Where this information was available in a format suitable for use in a GIS, it was collated to inform a state wide dataset of groundwater and surface water interaction. The resulting product attributes the stream base layer (described above) with the following classification of groundwater and surface water interaction:   Gaining//Variable//Neutral/Losing//Unclassified\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGIS data based on DSE, 2012. Victorian groundwater-surface water interaction spatial data. Compiled for the Secure Allocation, Future Entitlements (SAFE) Project by the Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria.\n\n\n\nThe method used to generate the dataset of groundwater and surface water interaction in Victoria can be summarised as: (1) Where a hydrogeochemistry study by Monash University was available to provide an indication of groundwater and surface water interaction it was adopted with high reliability; (2) Where a Murray-Darling Basin sustainable yields groundwater and surface water interaction study was available, it was adopted with medium reliability; (3) Where Melbourne Water Corporation (MWC) had indicated river reaches characterised by remnant pools of water in prolonged drought, this was considered to be indicative of gaining river conditions, with medium reliability; (4) Where a baseflow indices study was available, it was indicative of a gaining river reach and assigned medium reliability; (5) Where no other information existed and the river was classified as \"unmodified\", it was assumed to be gaining if it was perennial and neutral/losing if it was not perennial. These river reaches were assigned a low reliability; (6) Where no other information existed and the river was classified as \"modified\", an indication of groundwater-surface water interaction could not occur, given that the modification of flows could be responsible for the perenniality of the river reach, as opposed to being indicative of losing or gaining groundwater; (7) A reliability dataset was also generated that indicates the assumed reliability of the classification, which was directly correlated to the reliability of the input data.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) Gippsland region clip of Victorian groundwater-surface water interaction.

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2022 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2022 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2022 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the Autumn period between March 1989 to May 1989. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "title": "Greenacre Park Stormwater Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is known as the Greenacre Park catchment. It is one of four catchment areas\nthat drain to the Upper Cooks River, which flows to Botany Bay through the Cooks River.\nThe study area is located mostly within the Sydney suburb of Greenacre, in the north-east\ncorner of the Bankstown Local Government Area. The catchment commences near\nGreenacre Road and flows in a northerly direction to the Hume Highway. From the Hume\nHighway, the catchment drains through the State Rail Authority’s Chullora Workshops to join\nthe Upper Cooks River.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for over 1,000 stormwater pits\nand 900 stormwater drainage pipelines. Photos of culverts and other sketches are also\nlinked to the database.\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. All pipes, drains and\ncreeks are included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

    "title": "Victorian Alpine Resorts - Daily Snow Depth Records Mount Stirling",
    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "Core GC04, was collected from the southeastern side of the New Caledonian Basin (22.99965 S, 166.150716 E). Carbonate percent in the curve has an average value of ~79% and varies between 51.4% and 88.8%. Carbonate pecent does show small variations in scale and repeating patterns, however data tends to stay between 70-80%. It is interesting to note that the carbonate percent minimum of 51.4% occurs at the beginning of isotope stage 4 (~73Ka BP). This anomaly is relatively simultaneous to a decrease in 18O and slight increase in sedimentation rate. Significant non-carbonate sediments include glass shards, sub-rounded quartz, radiolarians, sponge spicules, manganese nodules and 'red opaque' material. Trends of glass shard and quartz percentages can be seen in the results. Radiolaria and sponge spicles tend not to show any definite trend, however both tend to increase subsequent to a broader non-carbonate sedimentation increase.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to map each surface water works with the volumetric entitlement without double counting the volume and to aggregate/ disaggregate the data depending on the final use.\n\n\n\nThis has been clipped to the Gloucester PAE.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\n1.\tJoe Bell (GA) has clipped the surface water licences to the Gloucester PAE. This clip contains the works associated with the sharecomponent/ entitlement. This can be a many to many relationship. . A work is a surface water extraction point.\n\nSW_licences_GloucesterPAE_Clip.dbf\n\n2.\tShare component/ entitlement information was stored in the     SW_Gloucester_COMBINED_v4.csv worksheet\n\n3.\tTotal volume of share component/ entitlement is 10,786ML \n\n4.\tThe works and share/component information was joined using Access, linking the CWlicence to the WAorCA_link. This links the volumetric entitlement to the works location.\n\n5.\tThis link also created share components that had a 0 entitlement which are licences that have been converted to unbundled licences in the new Water Act\n\n6.\tBy filtering out the 0 entitlement, the number of works linked to a share/component or entitlement with a specified  volume was 212 with a total of 10,786ML.   Worksheet FilteredIndividualSWLicences\n\n7.\tWhere there was more than one works per licence, an additional column was add COUNT_CWLICENSE. This shows where the share component/ entitlement is double counted as it is matched to each work with the full allocation.\n\n8.\tAn additional column was added SHARE_PER_WORKS which divides the share component/ entitlement by the number of works to give an allocation per works.\n\n9.\tThe SHARE_PER_WORKS column allows you to  plot the works with the share component in ArcGIS without double counting the allocation.\n\n10. A glossary of terms used ini the water licensing is included here:    http://registers.water.nsw.gov.au/wma/Glossary.jsp\n\n11.\tAn additional worksheet was added to aggregate the data into Water Sources and Management Zones.

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for November 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "###_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. \r\nWe have published explanatory notes to help you understand this dataset.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS.\r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the ACNC website.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click here to view them.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis database supersedes the previous version GIP AssetList Database v1.2 20150130, correcting Asset identifiers (AID) that were duplicated between databases. \n\nThis dataset contains the spatial and non-spatial (attribute) components of the Gippsland bioregion Asset List as two .mdb files, which are readable as an MS Access database or as an ESRI Personal Geodatabase.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Gippsland are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Gippsland bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed.\n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"AssetList_database_GIP_v1p3_20150212.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset.\n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.\n\n\n\nDetailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"AssetList_database_GIP_v1p3_20150212.doc\" located in the zip file.\n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe Asset List Database was developed to identify water dependent assets located within the Gippsland bioregion.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe title of this dataset was changed from \"GIP AssetList Database v1.3 20150212\" on 20 April 2015.\n\nSource codes for input datasets that are not yet registered and are therefore unable to be linked to this database via BADMS are as follows:\n\n- ECON_SW_VIC_RegRiv\n\n- ECON_SW_VIC_UnRegRiv\n\n\n\nThis dataset is an update of the previous version of the Gippsland asset list database: \"Gippsland Asset List V1 20141210\"; ID: 112883f7-1440-4912-8fc3-1daf63e802cb, which was updated with the inclusion of a number of additional datasets from the Victorian Department of the Environment and Primary Industries as identified in the \"linkages\" section and below.\n\n\n\nVictorian Farm Dam Boundaries\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/311a47f9-206d-4601-aa7d-6739cfc06d61\n\n\n\nFlood Extent 100 year extent West Gippsland Catchment Management Authority GIP v140701\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/dataset/2ff06a4f-fdd5-4a34-b29a-a49416e94f15\n\n\n\nIrrigation District Department of Environment and Primary Industries GIP\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/880d9042-abe7-4669-be3a-e0fbe096b66a\n\n\n\nLandscape priority areas (West)\n\nWest Gippsland Regional Catchment Strategy Landscape Priorities WGCMA GIP 201205\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/6c8c0a81-ba76-4a8a-b11a-1c943e744f00\n\n\n\nPlantation Forests Public Land Management(PLM25) DEPI GIP 201410\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/495d0e4e-e8cd-4051-9623-98c03a4ecded\n\n\n\nand additional data identifying \"Vulnerable\" species from the datasets:\n\nVictorian Biodiversity Atlas flora - 1 minute grid summary\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/d40ac83b-f260-4c0b-841d-b639534a7b63\n\n\n\nVictorian Biodiversity Atlas fauna - 1 minute grid summary\n\nhttps://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/datastore/dataset/516f9eb1-ea59-46f7-84b1-90a113d6633d\n\n\n\nA number of restricted datasets were used to compile this database.

It includes field quality parameters, methane concentrations and major and minor ion concentrations.  It is based on the following data sources:   GA compiled hydrochemistry datasets:  Surface water data from the Queensland water monitoring information portal (https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au/), accessed and downloaded in January 2019; Data from EHS Support (2014) Water baseline assessment (ATP1087) prepared for Armour Energy.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nA hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on groundwater and surface water datasets from the Isa GBA region. For this purpose, nine variables (Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO3, Cl, SO4, electrical conductivity and pH) which were measured across most hydrochemical records were selected. Prior to the multivariate statistical analysis, all variables except for pH were log-transformed to ensure that each variable more closely follows a normal distribution. The multivariate statistical technique is described in more details by Raiber et al. (2012) and Raiber et al. (2016).",

DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "This is a regional GHRSST level 3 collated (L3C) dataset on 0.02-degree rectangular grid over the Australasian domain (70E to 190E, 70S to 20N) based on retrievals from the AHI imager on board Himawari-8 satellite. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) produces Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) satellite SST products in the International Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) GDS2 file formats for Himawari-8 in real time and delayed mode. This product is composed of reprocessed multi-swath SSTskin retrievals obtained from compositing IMOS Himawari-8 hourly L3C files over the night (before dawn).  \n\nEvery 10 minutes, the Himawari-8 full disk is processed to retrieve SSTs by using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTTOV12.3) and Bayesian cloud clearing method based on the ESA CCI SST code developed at the University of Reading. The hourly product on native grid is then produced by compositing over multiple swaths for the previous 1 hour by selecting the highest quality data with priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour. The L3C-01hour product on native grid is then remapped over the 0.02-degree IMOS grid to compose IMOS L3C-01hour product (Govekar et al., 2021,  https://www.foo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Govekar_FOO_2021.pdf). The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2.",

    "description": "The 2019 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development, and job satisfaction. The census ran from 6 May to 7 June 2019. Overall, 104,471 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 77%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2019 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2019 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2019 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2019 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au.

    "description": "We must understand the natural cycles of the oceans to understand the evolution of our climate through geological time. Core MD 002361 was obtained in 2000 off the coast of Sumatra (113.477166 E, 22.082 S). By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information regarding past oceanographic and climatic systems. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile of the core (revealing sedimentation rates), the relative abundance of planktonic foraminifera over time, and estimates of historical sea-surface temperatures. The core description highlights the stark contrast between glacial and interglacial periods with 1-1.5m bands of red clay indicating interglacial periods, alternating with the 1-1.5m bands of light grey foraminifera sand deposited during the glacial periods.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "Avoca Lagoon is the largest of the four coastal lagoons within Gosford. The lagoon has a cruciform shape\nwith a surface area of 97.5 hectares and average depth of 1.3 metres. The let-out-level is approximately 2\nmetres above mean sea level. The lagoon entrance is normally closed due to the action of coastal dynamic\nprocesses which result in the formation of a beach berm across the lagoon entrance, linking Avoca and\nNorth Avoca beaches.\nGosford City Council has records of openings of the Avoca Lagoon entrance commencing in 1972. These\nrecords show that the entrance has been opened 58 times over the period 1976 to 2003, primarily for flood\ncontrol purposes. The entrance has broken out naturally on four other occasions when floodwaters caused\nthe lagoon level to rise above the level of the beach berm.\nRecords of inundation of Avoca Lagoon by ocean storms are not as complete as those available for the\nopening of the entrance. Limited data are available for severe ocean storms in May 1974, June 1978 and\nAugust 1986 when waves overtopped the beach berm and entered the lagoon.\n\nThe floodplain management process seeks to promote the adoption of an integrated approach to the management of all lands within the Avoca Lagoon catchment.\nThis floodplain management study addresses the following issues:\n<ul>\n<li>existing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>environmental and planning considerations;</li>\n<li>future development;</li>\n<li>climatic change;</li>\n<li>flood damages;</li>\n<li>floodplain management options;</li>\n<li>floodplain management impacts;</li>\n<li>floodplain management economics;</li>\n<li>preferred floodplain management strategies.</li>\n</ul>",

This project’s primary objectives were…\n\nTo assess the suitability of drone-deployed systems for illustrating and accurately quantifying the changing topography of beach dunes, and…\nTo report on the sand erosion and accretion changes for the Floreat Beach dunes over the period 2018 to 2022.\n\nCCC obtained a WA Government grant to undertake this project under the Government’s ‘CoastWest’ coastal management initiative. This report, along with the considerable survey data and imagery acquired over the period, is the final deliverable per the terms of that grant.\nThis document reports on aerial surveys of Floreat Beach undertaken by ‘drone’ (more formally, ‘RPAS – Remotely Piloted Aircraft System’) conducted by drone operators ‘RemSense’, ‘OmniDrone’ and then ‘GeoCue’, sequentially over the period 2018 to 2022.\nThis report compares the findings across the 2018 to 2022 surveys at discrete sections of Floreat Beach, to illustrate and quantify dune erosion and accretion differences for these beach sections.

    "description": "The first capture of the area North of the Floreat Surf Life Saving Club, these sand dunes were captured by UAV imagery on 17th Aug 2021 for the Cambridge Coastcare beach dune modelling and monitoring project. It was created as part of an initiative to innovatively monitor coastal dune erosion and visualize these changes over time for future management and mitigation. This data includes Orthomosaic, DSM, DTM, Elevation Contours, 3D Mesh, 3D Point Cloud and LiDAR constructed from over 500 images captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh\nThe dataset is a DTM Elevation Contour shapefile of the area North of Floreat SLSC (2021 Flight-2 project area). Contours are taken from MSL (AHD) at 1 metre elevation intervals.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "The purpose of this investigation was to quantitatively describe the colour patterns of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis and their ability to change on a socially significant timescale. Five experiments were conducted as part of this investigation, with fieldwork completed in East Point Reserve, Darwin (NT) from Nov. to Jan. in 04/05 and 05/06. The five experiments were: \n\n1) Quantifying colour patterns on the black carapace of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis- To examine the relationship between colouration, carapace size, and sex. This information was used to construct images illustrating the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs.\n\n2) Colour changes associated with moulting - Cages were constructed and stocked with crabs which had been measured and photographed. In total 21 individuals (11 females, 10 males) were photographed through at least one moult. \n\n3) Colour changes associated with the semilunar cycle - During one semilunar cycle, from one neap tide to the next, digital photographs were taken of 22 crabs (10 males, 12 females) active in the cages at approximately low tide. Photos were examined to observe any colour changes on a day to day basis. \n\n4) Daily colour changes - Twenty-seven crabs (13 males, 14 females) were observed on the day after spring tide over several semilunar cycles. Digital photos of the crabs were taken before, during and after low tide. These photographs were examined for any changes in colour or pattern. \n\n5) Rapid colour changes - The ability of the crab to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer.",

DNA barcoding will aid in evaluating the extent of cephalopod biodiversity including revealing cryptic species and phylogeographic structure. Confirmation of species identities is also essential as glands from multiple individuals will be required for detailed proteomic analysis of the proteins produced by the octopus posterior salivary glands.  The chemical composition of the secretions will be determined through the application of multidisciplinary techniques, including cDNA library construction, mass spectrometry, molecular modelling and bioactivity testing.

At this time, positions are also estimates as GPS navigation systems did not exist.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer  \r\n--  \r\nThe data provided by AFMA is raw (unprocessed) data and may contain errors or be incomplete.

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "The 2017 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development, and job satisfaction. The census ran from 8 May to 9 June 2017. Overall, 99,417 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 71%.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are over 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2017 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2017 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2017 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2017 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2017 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2017 APS employee census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2017 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2017 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2014. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Horticulture farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated citrus, pome and stone fruit growing farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies, with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin accounts for about three-quarters of Australia's citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit production with a large percentage of these crops grown in the southern Basin. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash income for citrus farms increased to around $90 000 in 2013-14 and then declined to around $72 000 in 2014-15. Pome fruit and stone fruit growers achieved average farm cash incomes of around $108 000 and $75 000 in 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15 the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) was 0.4 per cent for citrus growers and 0.7 per cent for pome and stone fruit growers. \r\n\r\n An increasing proportion of citrus farms used drip/trickle systems and fewer farms used low-throw sprinklers. Other irrigation systems used by citrus growers included micro sprays, overhead sprinklers and flood/furrow irrigation. Low-throw sprinklers and drip/trickle irrigation were also the most commonly used systems on stone fruit farms. Pome fruit was irrigated using a range of systems, with the most popular systems being low-throw sprinklers, micro sprays and drip/trickle irrigation. \r\n\r\n Few citrus growers traded water from 2010-11 to 2012-13, but around 54 per cent were net sellers of water in 2013-14. Most pome and stone fruit growers were non-traders in all years except 2007-08 and 2013-14. ",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for August 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "The walking legs, carapaces and chelae of ocypodid crabs, particularly the well-studied fiddler crabs, are often brilliantly coloured. However, despite this array of colours there is still some debate over whether ocypodid crabs are actually capable of colour vision and what role it might play.\n\nThe aim of this experiment was to test the colour vision capabilities of fiddler crabs in a biologically significant context. To determine whether Uca mjoebergi use differences in spectral composition to discriminate between colours, and thus possess colour vision, I tested their ability to consistently discriminate yellow from various shades of grey. Experiments were conducted in October 2005 on an intertidal mudflat in the East Point Reserve, Darwin.\n\nWhen the crabs were reproductively active, during neap tide, wandering females were caught and placed under a container 15 cm from two identical plaster casts of a U. mjoebergi male's 21.8 mm claw. Females were given a choice between a yellow claw (Dulux Tiny Tin yellow enamel) and a claw painted white, 75% grey, 50% grey, 25% grey or black (made by mixing appropriate amounts of white and black Dulux Tiny Tin enamel paint). It was recorded which claw the female approached within 2 cm. Each combination was tested until 15 females successfully made a choice. \n\nThe same experiment was conducted with two tethered, size matched (within 1 mm claw length), and handedness-matched males in place of the plaster claws. The males were tethered with 1 cm of cotton super-glued to their carapace and tied to a nail stuck in the ground, allowing some restricted movement. I painted the males' claw either with the same yellow paint as above or with the light yellow paint, made by mixing one part yellow to 14 parts white paint. The experiment was repeated 25 times using different pairs of males and new females each time.",

The reports summarise the performance of these fisheries against the requirements of fisheries legislation and policy. \r\n\r\n The fisheries assessed in the Fishery status reports 2016 generated an estimated gross value of production of $348 million in 2014-15, which is about 13 per cent of Australia's total fisheries and aquaculture gross value of production of $2.6 billion. \r\n\r\n The  Fishery status reports  form part of a suite of ABARES publications that aim to provide a comprehensive and multidimensional account of the trends and outlook for Australian fisheries. The  Australian fisheries statistics  reports provide annual updates of fisheries production and trade data. Detailed analysis of the net economic returns of selected Commonwealth fisheries is provided in the annual  Australian fisheries economic indicators report . ",

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. Throughout different experiments a total of 746 neighbour relations have been investigated. The size data collected during these experiments (531 male-female neighbours : 215 male-male neighbours) is the basis of this dataset. \n\nFemale size was found to be positively correlated with the size of her nearest male neighbour. Male size was also positively correlated with the size of his nearest male neighbour, but more weakly than between male-female pairs.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from the transect running across the mouth of Jervis Bay, running from Point Perpendicular in the north, to Bowen Island in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~5 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nFor each day of sampling two resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station. For a number of sampling days a third resource is offered, providing vertically averaged CTD data over 4m depth bins.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\r\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\r\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\r\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\r\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\r\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\r\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment Designated irrigation\r\nareas indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\r\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\r\nThe precise meaning of the term designated irrigation area varies from\r\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\r\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\r\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\r\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\r\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\r\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\r\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\r\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\r\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\r\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\r\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\r\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\r\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\r\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\r\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\r\nsource material is highly variable and completness of coverage is poor in\r\nsome regions.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\r\n__00211a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\nLineage: The data set was constructed in vector format by appending irrigation area boundary data sets supplied by various agencies. The component data sets are listed below. One of the component data sets which was supplied as separate tiles in ArcView shapefile format was assembled into a single shapefile data set in ArcView 3.1. All other processing was carried out in ARC/INFO 7.2.1 under SunOS using double precision coordinates. For all operations in which processing used a fuzzy tolerance, the value specified was 0.00001 degrees (about 1 m). The raster form of the data set was made from the vector form. 1) Ord River Scheme, Stage 1, irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by Agriculture WA in ArcView shapefile format.2) Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland. This data set was supplied by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows designated irrigation areas. The coordinate datum is not known with certainty and was assumed to be the Australian Geodetic Datum 1984.3) Northern Murray-Darling Basin irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows actual irrigation areas, based on interpretation of coarse scale imagery derived from Landsat TM images. The data set comprises 11 polygons. Of these, five have not been retained in the national data set because they largely coincide with the much higher resolution polygons of the Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. A sixth has not been retained because it proves to be almost entirely covered by a national park and a perennial lake. One of the polygons that was retained was edited to give precedence to a higher resolution polygon in the Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland data set which it partly overlies.4) Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. This data set was supplied by the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, in ArcView shapefile format, as 50 separate tiles. It shows actual irrigation areas and a variety of other land uses and land covers related to cotton growing. It is based on interpretation of aerial photography and satellite imagery with extensive field checking. Only the polygons showing irrigation areas were included in the national data set. The tiles were merged in ArcView using the merge function of the GeoProcessing Wizard. Further processing was undertaken in AR\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "In recent years the term 'enhanced greenhouse effect' has become well known in modern society and yet aspects of this possible 'future climate' are poorly understood. The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. The core obtained offshore from Sumatra (BAR9043, 104.0316E, 5.82S) highlights an upwelling signal at 14,000 yrs BP that disrupts the warm stratified water column, which was a feature between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to present. This upwelling is timed to a regional pattern of an intensified Australasian Monsoon.",

    "title": "Parent record: Vertical coherence of currents in Jervis Bay: Winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe fifth of these six experiments involved the winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), moored in the central part of Jervis Bay (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed.\n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There is only one subsiduary records that directly relates to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \nfef1f3c0-6d9f-11dd-8128-00188b4c0af8",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is largely located within the Sydney suburb of Panania. The study area\nincludes the entire Kelso Creek catchment, from the stormwater pipe network in the upper\ncatchment to Kelso Creek, which flows through Kelso Park and eventually joins the Georges\nRiver. The lower catchment is provided some protection against flooding from the Georges\nRiver through the Kelso levee. The catchment is wholly within the Bankstown local\ngovernment area.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for some 850 stormwater pits\nand 810 stormwater drainage pipelines. Photos of culverts and other sketches are also\nlinked to the database.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. All pipes, drains and\ncreeks are included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\n\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

Data is for 2010–11 and 2015–16, and the associated change between the two years.\r\n\r\nNon-agricultural land uses are mapped using seven thematic layers, derived from existing datasets provided by states and territories, and external agencies. The seven layers are:\r\n\r\n* protected areas\r\n* topographic features\r\n* land tenure\r\n* forest cover\r\n* catchment-scale land use\r\n* urban boundaries\r\n* stock routes.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural land uses are based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ 2010–11 and 2015–16 agricultural census data; with spatial distributions modelled using MODIS satellite imagery and training data, assisted by spatial constraint layers for cultivation, horticulture, and irrigation.\r\n\r\nLand use is specified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8. The same method is applied to both time points using representative national datasets for each period, where available. All rasters are in GeoTIFF format with geographic coordinates in Geocentric Datum of Australian 1994 (GDA94) and a 0.002197 degree (~250 metre) cell size.\r\n\r\nThe Land use of Australia 2010–11 to 2015–16 data package is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program.",

    "title": "Cost of production - Australian beef cattle and sheep producers 2012-13 to 2014-15",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents and discusses cost of production estimates for beef cattle and sheep producers for the three years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The on-farm cost of beef production on a per kilogram live weight basis increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15, as producers increased farm expenditure in 2014-15 in response to the much higher prices received for beef cattle. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, producers pared back expenditure on beef inputs to a minimum in response to low beef cattle prices in an attempt to maintain operating margins (receipts per kilogram less costs of production). \r\n• The largest increase in production costs occurred in northern Australia, where many beef producers were also subject to dry seasonal conditions in 2013-14 and 2014-15. This resulted in increased expenditure on fodder and freight. Overall, the total cost of production increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15 by 33 cents per kilogram live weight in northern Australia and by 25 cents in southern Australia. \r\n• Total costs of production averaged over the three years ending 2014-15 were similar in southern and northern Australia, at 174 cents per kilogram live weight in southern Australia and 175 cents in northern Australia. Northern Australia includes Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley, Pilbara and Murchison-Gascoyne regions of Western Australia. All other regions are included in southern Australia. \r\n• Higher beef cattle prices in 2014-15 resulted in operating margins increasing relative to the very low margins recorded in 2013-14. However, expenditure on farm inputs increased, so operating margins were similar to those recorded in 2012-13. \r\n• The average on-farm cost of sheep production on a per kilogram live weight basis remained largely unchanged between 2012-13 and 2014-15. \r\n• The average cost of production for beef cattle and sheep producers for the period 2012-13 to 2014-15 decreased as production size increased, which indicates that significant economies of size exist in beef and sheep meat production. These economies of size would be an incentive to expand beef and sheep meat production to enhance profitability. \r\n• Economies of size for sheep producers appear to result mainly from larger sheep enterprises using farm capital and labour more efficiently. However, for beef producers, cash operating costs for larger herd size producers were lower than those for smaller producers and they used farm capital and labour more efficiently. \r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Hobart in TAS with SA2 code 601051027, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Regional Airborne Electromagnetics survey data (AusAEM) were used  to estimate the depth and thickness of the Carpentaria Basin where it overlies the Beetaloo GBA region. Models derived from AEM data represent thickness and extent of clay rich lithologies within the Carpentaria Basin sequence and overlying Cenozoic (when present) rather than the whole of the Carpentaria Basin.  Areas with clay rich lithologies would have tendency to impede recharge. For further information see Fact sheet 6 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe geological surface models were created by interpolating point depth estimates from from AusAEM depth estimates  for Beetaloo GBA) using ArcGIS. Models derived from AEM data represent thickness and extent of clay rich lithologies within the Carpentaria basin sequence and overlying Cenozoic (when present) rather than the whole of the Carpentaria Grids were interpolated using the Natural Neighbour methodology.",

    "description": "The Cape Grim program, established by the Australian Government to monitor and study global atmospheric composition, is a joint responsibility of the Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station began taking samples of the atmosphere over twenty years ago. Since the first sampling began in April 1976, there have been more that 3 billion measurements taken. Among these are measurements of green house gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide as well as chemicals which deplete the ozone layer.  Since the station first began in 1976, a 10% increase in carbon dioxide (one of the main greenhouse gases) has been measured. In addition long term records of aerosol particulates, radon and solar radiation have been obtained. As well as monitoring a wide range of atmospheric trace gases, Cape Grim measures concentrations of natural and anthropogenic particles, and meteorological parameters including wind speed and direction, rainfall, temperature, humidity and air pressure. Sophisticated measurements of solar radiation, including harmful UV-B radiation, are also carried out.",

    "description": "This is a single sensor, multiple swath SSTskin product for three consecutive night-time periods, derived using observations from the AVHRR instrument on the NOAA-XX satellites. It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70°E to 170°W, 20°N to 70°S.  Only night time passes are included in the product. Each grid cell contains the 3 night average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data/product-informa\ntion/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products.  Matchups with buoy SST observations (adjusted to skin depths) indicate typical 2014 biases of &lt; 0.1 degC and standard deviations of 0.5 degC to 0.6 degC for NOAA-18 and NOAA-19.  Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.",

This data has been derived primarily from GEODATA TOPO 250K Series 1 and contains the following features: State borders, roads, railways, populated places, rivers and lakes, coastline and islands, bathymetric and land contours, and spot locations.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe key source for production of the Builtup Areas, Drainage, Framework, Localities, Rail Transport, Road Transport and Waterbodies layers was the GEODATA TOPO 250K Series 1 product. Some revision of the Builtup Areas, Road Transport, Rail Transport and Waterbodies layers was carried out using the latest available satelite imagery. The primary source for the Spot Heights, Contours and Offshore layers was the GEODATA TOPO 10M Version 1 product. A further element to the production of GEODATA TOPO 10M 2002 has been the datum shift from the Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66) to the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (GDA94).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2013) GEODATA TOPO 10M 2002.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nThis dataset is a complete state-wide digital land use map of Queensland. The dataset is a product of the Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) and was produced by the Queensland Government. It presents the most current mapping of land use features for Queensland, including the land use mapping products from 1999, 2006 and 2009, in a single feature layer. This dataset was last updated July 2012. See additional information also.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nIndicates the current primary use or management objective of the land.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nSource DataQueensland Government - Land use mapping (1999); Landsat TM and ETM imagery; Spot5 imagery; High resolution ortho photography through the Spatial Imagery Subscription Plan (SISP); Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) (2009), Queensland Valuation and Sales Database (QVAS) (2009); Queensland Nature Refuges (2009); Queensland Estates (2009); Queensland Herbarium's Regional Ecosystem, Water Body and Wetlands datasets (2009); Statewide Landcover & Trees Study (SLATS) Queensland Dams and Waterbodies (2009) and land cover change data; scanned aerial photography (1999-2009).Additional verbal & written information on land uses & their locations was obtained from regional Queensland Government officers, Local Government Authorities, land owners & managers, private industry as well as from field observations & checking.Data captureA range of existing digital datasets containing land use information was collated from the Queensland Government spatial data inventory and prepared for use in a GIS using ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine software.Processing steps To compile the 1999 baseline mapping, datasets containing baseline land cover (supplied by SLATS), Protected Areas, State Forest and Timber Reserves, plantations, coastal wetlands, reserves (from DCDB) and logged forests were interpreted in a spatial model to produce a preliminary land use raster image.The model incorporated a decision matrix which assigned each pixel a specific land use class according to a set of pre-determined rules.Individual catchments were clipped from the model output and enhanced with additional land use information interpreted primarily from Landsat TM and ETM imagery as well as scanned and hardcopy aerial photography (where available). The DCDB and other datasets containing land use information were used to help identify property and land use type boundaries. This process produced a draft land use raster.Verification of the draft land use dataset, particularly those with significant areas of intensive land uses, was undertaken by comparing mapped land use classes with observed land use classes in the field where possible. The final raster image was converted to a vector coverage in ARC/Info and GIS editing performed.The existing 1999 baseline (or later where available) land use dataset (vector) formed the basis for the 2006 and 2009 land use mapping. The 2006 & 2009 datasets were then updated primarily by interpretation of SPOT5 imagery, high-res orthophotography, scanned aerial photography and inclusion of expert local knowledge. This was performed in an ESRI ArcSDE geodatabase replication infrastructure, across some nine regional offices. The DCDB, QVAS, Estates, Queensland Herbarium wetlands and SLATS land cover change and waterbody datasets were used to assist in identification and delineation of property and land use type boundaries. Digitised areas of uniform land use type were assigned to land use classes according to ALUMC Version 7 (May 2010).This \"current\" land use mapping product presents a complete state-wide land use map of Queensland, after collating the most current land use datasets within a single mapping layer.An independent validation was undertaken to assess thematic (attribute) accuracy under the ALUM classification. Please refer to the orignal source data for the validation results.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nQueensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts (2013) Bioregional_Assessment_Programme_Land use mapping - Queensland current.

These include differences in climate, the use of\nnatural gas, the type of housing (house or apartment), type of business\n(commercial or industrial), and varying household socio-demographics or\nbusiness types.\n\nThese figures also do not necessarily include the electricity used in common\nareas of apartments like halls, garages or pools. About 20% of energy in an\napartment building is typically used in these sorts of areas.\n\nThis data does not include high voltage customers and supply to services such\nas public lighting and bus shelters.\n\nFor help in interpreting the data, please contact\n[sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au](mailto:sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au).\n\n",
