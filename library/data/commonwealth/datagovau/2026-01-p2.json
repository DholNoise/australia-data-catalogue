However, labour force population benchmarks are now updated more frequently when preliminary population estimates become available, and again when these preliminary estimates are subsequently revised. For this release of Gender Indicators, Australia, labour force estimates dating back to (and including) 2014-15 have been revised in accordance with this new benchmarking process. Future revisions to benchmarks will then take place every time a new year of labour force data becomes available for publishing in the Gender Indicators publication. Re-benchmarking historical data has not resulted in any material change to unemployment rates, participation rates or employment to population ratios. For more information see ABS Labour Force, Australia, Jun 2016 (cat. no. 6202.0).\t\t\t\t\t\r\nSource: ABS data available on request, Labour Force Survey\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.  \n  \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Sydney) with SA2 code (11337).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Sydney - Haymarket - The Rocks SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

The Primary compartments have been subdivided into secondary compartments based on landform associations and then further subdivided into tertiary compartments based on individual landforms present. This dataset was commissioned by the Department of Planning and compiled by Damara Pty Ltd and the Geological Society of WA. A full report was also prepared to accompany the dataset, published August 2011. Some superficial changes have been made to the dataset since publication of the report in order to amalgamate the data into a nationwide compartment dataset developed by Geoscience Australia.Attribution for this dataset is incomplete and ongoing.

    "description": "Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. \n\nExperiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT.\nThis experiment was designed to determine if owner advantage in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, is due to a mechanical advanatage. Possible advantages come from the ability of the owner to utilise the burrow when fighting. For example, owners can retreat into their burrow and block the entrance using the 'flat-claw' defence. In addition to this, fiddler crabs may also gain advantage by using the burrow shaft during fights, producing greater leverage for their enlarged claw. This was tested by pitching fights between prior owners and resident owners with either their burrow blocked or open. Owners with unblocked burrows won 88% of contests, and those with blocked burrows won 38% of contests. This is a significance difference and infers that owners have a strong mechanical advantage.",

The data is highly detailed, including information on each aspect of the application process from application through to granting of IP rights. We have published a paper to accompany IPGOLD which describes the data and illustrates its use, as well as a technical paper on the firm matching.\r\n\r\nIPGOLD is inherently the same data as the IPGOD data set, with a weekly update instead of the annual snapshot available in IPGOD. Many of the scripts of IPGOLD are still being developed and tested. As such IPGOLD should be considered a Beta release. ",

    "description": "Cocos Island - Hillshade - 2011\nIn 2013 a hillshade image (similar to the shiny colour drapes) was produced from the 2011 digital elevation model. The hillshade shows the ground surface underneath trees and buildings and was created in ArcMap using an azimuth of 315 and an altitude of 45. A vertical exaggeration of 10 was applied to highlight elevation differences. The hillshade covers the full extent of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The ESRI ArcGIS Resource Centre describes a hillshade image as :\n\n“A hillshade is a grayscale 3D model of the surface, with the sun's relative position taken into account for shading the image. This function uses the latitude and azimuth properties to specify the sun's position.” \n\nThe hillshade image can be viewed as a greyscale image, or underneath the DEM (if semi-transparent). It can also be viewed under any other layer to show the lie of the land, for example orthophotography, canopy heights or infrastructure. \n\nThe hillshade was created from the 2011 DEMwhich is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

The percentage of calcium carbonate in samples collected from different depths were analysed, along with other parameters, to determine changes in carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx. The results indicate that the minimums in CaCO3% precede the glacial maximums (at 130cm), then rapidly increase during deglaciations to reach a peak in CaCO3% of ~75% during the mid-interglacial.",

    "description": "Context. Managing widespread invasive plants to support biodiversity conservation is a significant challenge that requires weed control methods that have lesser impacts on co-occurring native species than ongoing weed invasion. African lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula) is a perennial grass invasive in many regions globally. There is a lack of effective control options, particularly in diverse native vegetation where application of broad-spectrum herbicide has risks of unacceptable off-target impacts. Aims. We tested the effectiveness of flupropanate (sodium 2,2,3,3-tetra-fluoropropionate) in controlling African lovegrass in a conservation context in Mediterranean-climate south-western Australia, testing two application rates and measuring target and off-target impact. Methods. Cover of plant species and their condition (alive or dead) was measured in replicate plots in a ‘before-after-control-impact’ design. Key results. Flupropanate significantly reduced African lovegrass cover, with greater reduction at the higher application rate. No significant off-target effects could be detected at a community or plant functional group level. Conclusions. The results of this study indicate that flupropanate is effective in controlling African lovegrass in conservation settings in south-western Australia. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the use of flupropanate for invasive grass management. Implications. Possible off-target impacts on a single species in this study, and stronger evidence from other sources, suggests that robust testing of the susceptibility of conservation-listed flora to flupropanate should precede application in their habitat.\n\n<strong><em>Note: to access the data, select the data source link located on the right-hand side.</em></strong>",

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) route segments for the year of 2011. Route segments are a public transport link between two adjacent activity nodes or other network nodes. A numbered public transport route is usually made up of a sequence of consecutive route segments\nThe SNAMUTS methodology has been developed as a planning and decision-making support tool. It determines accessibility performance from a user perspective, bearing in mind that different users sometimes have different needs: some may value speed more than anything else, some may require barrier-free access as their first priority, others may be drawn primarily to services that are legible and have a high profile in the urban realm. Good accessibility is often the result of a balance and integration of these sometimes competing, sometimes complementary claims on the usability of the land use-transport system. The analysis includes a set of tasks and measurements that highlight the contribution of the public transport network and service development from a range of perspectives.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n\n\nService Intensity\n\n\nCloseness Centrality\n\n\nDegree Centrality\n\n\nNetwork Coverage\n\n\nContour Catchments\n\n\nBetweenness Centrality\n\n\nResilience\n\n\nNodal Connectivity\n\n\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nThis data provides context to the corresponding indicator datasets: \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Activity Nodes (Point) 2011\" or \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Areas (SA1) 2011\".\n\n\nSome routes are composed of disjoint line segments and as such the data should be used for visualisation purposes only.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset created by the University of Sydney, includes time series digital soil map products of soil organic carbon (SOC) between January 1990 and December 2020 for the Regional Forest Agreement regions of eastern NSW.  Modelling was completed using a data cube platform incorporating machine learning space-time framework and geospatial technologies. Products provide estimates of SOC concentrations and associated trends through time. Also important covariates required to drive this spatio-temporal modelling are identified using the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm (RFE), which including a range of predictors that vary in space, time and space and time. \nFull description of the digital soil maps and methods are presented in:\nMoyce MC, Gray JM, Wilson BR, Jenkins BR, Young MA, Ugbaje SU, Bishop TFA, Yang X, Henderson LE, Milford HB, Tulau MJ, 2021.

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Yarramundi Irrigated site is an improved, managed pasture on the Western Sydney University Hawkesbury campus. Original woodland vegetation was cleared prior to 1950. A mixture of native and exotic grasses and forbs dominate the site, which is used by cattle in an intensively managed grazing operation. The flux tower was established in October of 2019 and is managed by the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, with partial support from TERN and WSU Office of Estate and Commercial (Farm Production Unit).\n\nThe climate is warm-temperate, with annual rainfall averaging 728&nbsp;mm, mean maximum temperature in January of 30.4&deg;C and mean minimum temperature in July of 3.6&deg;C (BOM station 067105). The elevation of the site is about 20&nbsp;m asl and the topography is flat. The soil is sandy loam in texture, organic carbon content is &lt;1%.",

    "description": "Enhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP)-Air Sea Flux sub-facility collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific  and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. Data products are quality controlled observations, and bulk air-sea fluxes.\n\nResearch Vessel Real Time Air-Sea Fluxes, aims to equip the Marine National Facility (MNF) (Research Vessel Southern Surveyor) and the Research and Supply Vessel, Aurora Australis with \"climate quality\" meteorological measurement systems, capable of providing high quality air-sea flux measurements and delivered to researchers on a near real-time basis. Obtaining the full set of air-sea fluxes essential for climate studies requires observations of: wind, air and sea temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, long- and short-wave radiation. The existing ship meteorological sensor sets have been completed with IMOS instruments and a comprehensive annual calibration programs implemented. The ships have dual sets of radiometers, temperature and humidity sensors, precipitation gauges (optical rain gauge and Siphon gauge) and anemometers (2-d sonic and prop/vane - Southern Surveyor only)  . The Aurora Australis will be fitted with two long-wave radiometers and one ORG (serviced during winter port time). Data streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 1-minute averages of the observations and a daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.",

This voyage was staffed by only one GSM team member, thus 24 hours acquisition was not possible and there may be gaps in the data record.\n\nThe Simrad EK80 split beam echosounders for 18, 38, 70 120, 200 and (333) kHz were used to acquire acoustic backscatter data to a range of 1500 m, between the Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) mooring site and South Tasman Rise. All frequencies were logged sporadically for the extent of the voyage. The 333khz frequency was set to passive for the whole of the voyage.\nData are stored in <em>.raw, </em>.bot and *.idx format at CSIRO. There are 70 files totalling 6.66 GB of raw data in this dataset.\n\nNo processing has been conducted on this data.\n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "This dataset contains cycling volume, movement flow and demographic data for the 'Super Sunday' Recreation Bike Count event over the years 2011 to 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were visually undertaken by volunteers. The data covers the following Local Government Areas (LGAs):\n\n\nBoroondara\n\n\nMonash\n\n\nMoonee Valley\n\n\nMoreland\n\n\nWhitehorse\n\n\nYarra\n\n\nBicycle Network's 'Super Counts' programs count the volumes of bicycles and other active travellers, and their movements on roads and paths. The Super Counts program comprises two counting events: 'Super Tuesday' commuter count and the 'Super Sunday' recreation count. Super Tuesday is a two-hour count conducted during a Tuesday morning peak period in March (7-9am); Super Sunday is a four-hour count conducted during a Sunday morning-afternoon period in November (9-1pm).\nFor more information please visit Bicycle Network Bike Counts.\nBicycle counts help track progress, and identify areas of improvement to inform active transport policy with the goal of making it easier for more people to choose active modes everyday. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nAURIN has converted dates to ISO 8601 format, and have spatially enabled this dataset by creating geometries from the latitude and longitude columns with PostGIS.",

A combination of existing data sources and field data collection was used to identify the existence of artificial barriers and whether these structures represented partial or complete barriers (Pope et al. 2015). Partial barriers were those that were considered to allow limited or intermittent movement of biota. Complete barriers were those that represented an absolute and permanent barrier to biota. Where artificial barriers were identified, the most likely location of the natural (pre-1750) inland extent (length) of the estuary was derived from historical documents, field observations, elevation data and geomorphology to provide a `natural estuary length¿.",

    "title": "Connectivity Potential for Australia (Version 1)",
    "description": "This dataset illustrates connectivity options for the fragmented landscapes of mainland Australia.  It has been developed using a least cost paths method (LCP).  Version 1 is a combination of analyses within the fragmented landscapes of south-western Western Australia (SWWA), and southern and eastern mainland Australia (SEA). \n\nThe LCP method identifies the shortest cumulative 'cost' route across a resistance surface.  The resistance surface is based on the Euclidian distance from remaining natural areas, where higher costs were ascribed to increasing distances away from those areas.   Natural areas were identified by combining the National Vegetation Information System Version 4.1 data, and the National Carbon Accounting Forest Cover Version 8 data (after removing areas of plantation forestry).  \n\nTo favour ecologically important areas, the resistance values of this basic surface were halved for riparian areas and remnant vegetation greater than 10 hectares after a 100 metres edge had been removed.  This has the effect of drawing the routes towards these features.\n\nThe LCP analysis requires begin and end points, which are connected by identifying the lowest resistance route.   Landscape 'foundation stones' were used for this purpose.  The foundation stones were the National Reserve System, World Heritage Areas, private conservation lands, Ramsar and important wetlands, and nationally significant remnants (those greater than 100 hectares after removing a 100 metre edge).\n\nThe foundation stone areas were converted to point features and the LCP analysis was develop to connect every point to every other point.  To constrain the model, routes were identified only for points less than 50 kilometres from each other.  Because each point is connected to all others (within 50 kilometres) lowest cost routes may be identified numerous times.  This count is captured in an attribute field named 'popularity'. \n\nUsage Notes:\n\nThe LCP analysis was developed on cost surfaces with a 250 metre cell size for SWWA, and 500 metres for the SEA region.  The product described here has been delivered as a network of lines which actually represent potential connections much wider than the lines. As a consequence the product is indicative of the optimum route and should be used to identify potential connectivity options by expanding (buffering) the lines to represent at least 250 metre wide connections.  Precise locations and widths of functional re-connections will require finer resolution local planning.  \n\nThe basic cost surface has been developed as the distance from the edge of remnant natural areas.  Routes within natural areas have no validity because there is no differentiation of costs within them.  They remain in the dataset for completeness and recognising that users may have access to different remnant vegetation information to demonstrate connectivity options.  It is suggested that when presenting the data that the connectivity network be obscured (overlayed) by a natural areas dataset.\n\nThe popularity of the routes between foundation stones (attribution field called 'popularity') may be useful for landscape prioritisation or for cartographic purposes by illustrating wider connections to more ‘popular’ routes.\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhile reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nUse is granted under the Creative Commons by Attribution model.\nUse is granted under the Creative Commons by Attribution model.\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2014",

    "title": "Mammals Connected Habitat",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The collection took place in March 2020 when school operations were severely impacted by COVID-19, so the department did not follow up potential errors in class size or class structure with numerous schools.\n\n\nThe 2024 class size factsheet with state level aggregate data has been published and is available here:  https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/nsw-education-average-government-primary-school-class-sizes-by-school-size\n\n\nMulti-age classes are often designed to match the organisation of the syllabus, which is based on ‘stages’ running over two years.\n\n\nFrom 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.\n\n\nHistorical data displays the data that was correct in that year.\n\n\nResearch suggests that:\n\n\nClass organisation \"...will not determine either educational advantage or disadvantage...\" (NSW DET 1997).\n\n\nThe most important factors in determining student success are the quality of the teacher and his or her teaching.

    "description": "People often use different modes of transport at various times for a range of reasons, so it is important that we continue to listen to how people in NSW rate their experiences throughout their entire journey.\nConducting the ‘Customer Satisfaction Index’ helps us gain insight into the experiences of our transport users, which helps us focus our efforts on improving transport services to meet the needs of NSW residents.\nWe would like to thank the more than 34,000 people who provided their feedback, either online or face-to-face, for the most recent research, conducted in May 2024.\nPublic Transport in NSW\nPassengers impacted by disruptions due to adverse weather.\nSevere adverse weather events in early 2024 affected our public transport passengers, resulting in a slight decline in satisfaction with train timeliness. However, satisfaction with the ‘availability of information about service delays’ has slightly increased compared with six months ago.\nAs preparation continued during May for the new Sydney Metro expansion, passengers were kept well informed to what to expect with changes to services. Consequently,  passengers have remained highly satisfied, particularly with the ‘knowledge of staff’ and ‘information about delays’.\nAs public transport patronage continued to increase, satisfaction levels for comfort and ‘personal space’ have slightly decreased for buses, light rail and ferries.\nRoad\nSevere weather in early 2024 also impacted road users in NSW, leading to a decline in satisfaction with journey time reliability for private vehicles and motorcycles across the state.\nHeavy vehicle users have previously reported low satisfaction with rest areas across NSW. We have been focusing on improving these facilities, and it’s encouraging to see that satisfaction levels have continued to rise.\nActive transport users remain highly satisfied, with cyclists increasingly pleased with the ‘ease of connecting to public transport’ and pedestrians appreciating ‘sharing footpaths with others safely’.\nPoint-to-Point\nSatisfaction among users of point-to-point services (taxis, rideshares and hire cars) remains stable overall, with customers most satisfied with their accessibility and convenience.\nWhat’s Next\nWe will continue engaging with our passengers to gain deeper insights into their experiences across NSW’s transport network. This feedback will guide us in prioritising areas of low and declining satisfaction, helping us work towards delivering a consistently positive experience throughout their journey.",

    "description": "Ambulance Victoria has two official response time targets: Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 85% of incidents state-wide, and Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 90% of incidents in urban centres with populations greater than 7,500. Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective delivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are influenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1\", and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\" response. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time performance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics Urban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population. Ambulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population exceeds 7,500 persons.",

    "description": "The Peel-Harvey Estuary was divided into five regions; the Entrance Channel, Eastern Peel Inlet, Western Peel Inlet, Northern Harvey Estuary and Southern Harvey Estuary.  Within each region four sites were sampled seasonally over two years (total of 8 sampling occasions). At each site, sampling of fish was conducted using seine nets with length and weight of all collected fish measured. In addition, water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen were measured at each site.   The aim of the study is to develop cost-effective strategies for monitoring the fish community.\n\nData is still being collected / processed and will be released at the end of WAMSI program.",

    "description": "This dataset contains spatial layers describing Forest Loss and Recovery from 1998-2020 in NSW.\n\nFor this dataset product and the processing of metrics, aspects of canopy loss and disturbances in the forest estate were investigated.  Measures of canopy loss and recovery are seen as one of the multiple indicators of forest health.  This is related to agents or pressures that affect the capacity of native forests and commercial operations to maintain normal ecosystem functions and sustainably provide productive capacity. \n\nTo attribute disturbances, as a driver of change, a Multiple Lines of Evidence (MLE) approach was used that leveraged available spatial datasets.  This allowed for a project-wide disturbance and disturbance context layer to be generated. This information can be interpreted back against forest cover extent change outputs, in particular the differences between individual years, to identify the areas of change and the likely reasons why. Therefore, landscape trends in forest loss can be potentially assigned or at the very least investigated.  \n\nThe time taken, in terms of years, for areas to recover from losses in forest cover extent can has also been determined. This process identifies the time taken for a patch of forest to return to a 20% canopy cover threshold, and other characteristics such as the forest type and likely disturbance or loss event.\n\nBase cover extent grids used are from the NSW State-wide Historic Forest Cover Extent – 1995 to 2020 product.  These have been processed through a series of land use and vegetation type exclusion masking and a through a fuzzy-logic based certainty analysis to reflect a forest cover extent coverage for NSW that is reflective of past and current coverage.  \n\nRead more about the project on the Natural Resources Commission website:\nhttps://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/accordion-content-main/fmip-ecosystemhealth-projectfe1\n\nThis dataset supersedes \"NSW Forest Monitoring and Improvement Program RFA Historic Forest Loss and Recovery – 1998 to 2019\".",

Most records include catch composition by species (presence/absence but not weight), also some data on length frequency, maturity and diet of commercially important species. The data were obtained by exchange with Soviet scientists in the mid 1990s and has had CSIRO species codes incorporated. The dataset is now in an Oracle database in Hobart, and analyses/summaries of the data are given in the accompanying report (see References). A MS Access version of the dataset has been compiled for use within the North West Shelf-JEMS study. This version is available on-line for researchers in the NWS-JEMS study (see data links). The data are also accessible to authorised users via CMR's \"Data Trawler\" application. A username and password is required to access this dataset.",

    "description": "Vital baseline information on the demersal fish assemblages within the metropolitan area was collected used baited-video stations. The sampling was directed using the knowledge of experienced fishermen, and researchers from the Department of Fisheries and UWA. Recent changes to legislation, banning commercial wetline fishing in the Metropolitan area, have provided an important natural laboratory with which to assess the impacts of fishing on the assemblage of demersal fish.\nFrom 5th October 2008 to 12th October 2008 stereo-baited remote underwater video (stereo BRUV) systems were used to sample these areas shown in green in the thumbnail (around Two Rocks).  It provides a multi-species measure of the state of the fish community, including length measurements of the fish observed. This data will form an important baseline with which to assess any changes in the community and to investigate whether they are due to changes in fishing pressure or other impacts, such as climate change.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for single sex schools in Victoria for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

However, from time to time,\nincidents do affect schools just as they affect communities and\nsociety as a whole. This publication provides information on incident reports in NSW government schools. Publishing these reports informs the community about incidents in public schools and how the department supports schools through incidents while still protecting the identity of students and staff.\nData Notes:\n\n\nFollowing an incident, the Principal or School Executive is required to notify the department’s Incident Report and Support Hotline which includes seconded NSW Police officers so support and advice can be provided to assist the school with the management of the incident. All criminal related incidents are reviewed by the seconded police officers in line with legislative requirements. In some circumstances the Principal or School Executive may also contact NSW Police directly if an urgent response is required.\n\n\nReferences have been removed which could expose a person to a risk of harm or which reveals the identities, or the personal/health information of students, school staff and community members. Information that may prejudice an investigation has also been removed.\n\n\nThe categories of incidents that are reported by schools include drugs, technology, violence, weapons and welfare.\n\n\nData is published biannually in January and October.\n\n\nMore information:\n\n\nRefer to the individual publications for further information and policy context.\n\n\nNSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) crime maps\n\n\nData Source:\n\nPeople Group.

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Residential Population (ERP) data by 5-year age groups and sex for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for Local Government Areas (LGA) and VIFSAs for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nsmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them\n\n\nlarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level\n\n\nas far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘vh_vuln_line.shp’ contains line data indicating the approximate boundary of the freshwater aquifer that is of very high risk of contamination and over extraction.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behavior on the island. The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the very high vulnerability boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

The data includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

As a result CFA, Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) developed a proposal to align fire weather districts, TFB boundaries and Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries.\nAfter much consultation and amendments, it was agreed to approve the above proposal with the exception of Yarriambiack Shire which was divided using the east-west rabbit fence. The result created a total of 9 TFB Districts. These changes were implemented in October 2010.",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThese tables present a summary of employment under the _Public Service Act\r\n1999_ at 31 December 2011 and during the 2011 calendar year. The data is an\r\nupdate of that presented in the _APS Statistical Bulletin 2010-11. _Data will\r\nnow be available at six monthly intervals -A through this summary for\r\ncalendar year data, and through the annual State of the Service Report (SOSR)\r\nand APS Statistical Bulletin (the Bulletin) for more detailed financial year\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nThe data in these tables is sourced from the APS Employment Database (APSED),\r\nwhich contains data extracted from agencies-C/ HR systems. The Australian\r\nPublic Service Commission continues to work with agencies to improve the\r\nquality and timeliness of the data they provide to APSED. Each year extensive\r\naudits and error checking of APSED are undertaken, to ensure that sound\r\nconclusions can be drawn from the data. Through this audit process, previously\r\npublished data has been updated. The June 2011 data published in SOSR and the\r\nBulletin has been revised.\r\n\r\nAs in the Bulletin, a headcount approach is used in these tables-that is,\r\npeople working part-time are aggregated with people working full-time without\r\nweighting. Data also includes inoperative staff. Employees-C/\r\nclassification in these tables refers to their base or substantive\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations used in these tables and changes to administrative arrangements\r\nfor the period July to December 2011 are explained below. The Explanatory\r\nNotes at Appendix 1 of the Bulletin provide definitions of terms used in these\r\ntables. The Bulletin is available at [http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-\r\napsc/parliamentary/aps-statistical-bulletin/snapshots-\r\ndecember-2011](http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-apsc/parliamentary/aps-\r\nstatistical-bulletin/snapshots-december-2011)\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "PSR J1227-6208 is a recycled pulsar in a binary with a massive white dwarf companion. A recent timing measurement from combined MeerKAT and Parkes observations shows the companion mass to be between 1.2 and 1.5 solar masses, very close to the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in potentially profound physical implications. However, the timing precision is limited by the DM timing noise. We propose regular monitoring of this pulsar with the Parkes UWL receiver in conjunction with MeerKAT observations during the following four years. The joint monitoring will significantly improve the constraints on the Post-Keplerian parameters, with Parkes observations contributing to constrain the DM noise due to its large frequency bandwidth. These observations will be added to the already existing 11-year-long timing baseline, of which the later 5 years already include high-precision MeerKAT data and Parkes UWL data. After four years of further timing with the inclusion of UWL observations, we predict an uncertainty on the masses smaller than 0.01 solar masses based on simulations. If UWL is not included, the mass uncertainties may not improve beyond their current values.",

    "description": "This is Version 1 of the Australian pH (Water) product of the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia.\n\nThe map gives a modelled estimate of the spatial distribution of soil pH (1:5 soil water solution) in soils across Australia.\n\nThe Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia has produced a range of digital soil attribute products. Each product contains six digital soil attribute maps, and their upper and lower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths: 0-5&nbsp;cm, 5-15&nbsp;cm, 15-30&nbsp;cm, 30-60&nbsp;cm, 60-100&nbsp;cm and 100-200&nbsp;cm. These depths are consistent with the specifications of the <a href=\"https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/Resources/GlobalSoilMap_specifications_december_2015_2.pdf\">GlobalSoilMap.net project</a>. The digital soil attribute maps are in raster format at a resolution of 3 arc sec (~90 x 90&nbsp;m pixels).\n\nDetailed information about the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia can be found at - <a href=\"https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/index.html\">SLGA</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>Attribute Definition: pH of a 1:5 soil water solution;</li>\n<li>Units: None;</li>\n<li>Period (temporal coverage; approximately): 1950-2021;</li>\n<li>Spatial resolution: 3 arc seconds (approx 90&nbsp;m);</li>\n<li>Total number of gridded maps for this attribute: 18;</li>\n<li>Number of pixels with coverage per layer: 2007M (49200 * 40800);</li>\n<li>Data license : Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY);</li>\n<li>Target data standard: GlobalSoilMap specifications;</li>\n<li>Format: Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF;</li></ul>",

    "description": "The ISC2010_STRUCTURE1_S table is the Statistical Summary table for the Structure1 Metric at the 100m Section level. Structure 1 represents Vegetation Cover for two grouped height categories: Shrubs which are defined as vegetation in the height range 1.5m to 5m and Trees which are defined as vegetation with height greater than 5m.\n\nThe ISC2010_STRUCTURE1_S table is designed to JOIN to the ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINES_S feature class.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for March 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The data spans the months of 2013 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "Variations in microfossil records in sediments over time are used as proxies for changes in the ocean. One important record determined from microfossils is sea-ice cover which influences, and is influenced by, wind and ocean circulation, atmospheric conditions, and heat balance. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the predictive capabilities diatoms may bear in estimating Antarctic sea-ice, one of the important modulators of Southern Hemisphere climate. The purpose of this study was to estimate past sea-ice concentration and annual coverage at the site of core MD88-787 in the Southeast Indian Ocean. The accumulation of diatom microplankton assemblages in sediments being the proxy for these records of climatic change. \n\nA new method for sea-ice concentration and cover estimation from CABFAC derived factor analysis was developed during this project. Previous estimations of sea-ice have relied on other avenues of deriving limits to the maximum sea-ice edge, while the model developed here made use of modern sea-ice satellite observations combined with diatom distributions that are considered more closely linked to the sea-ice cover.\n\nThree models were proposed which estimated sea-ice concentration in February and September, and annual sea-ice cover.",

    "description": "The Perth Canyon Passive Acoustic Observatory consists of two to four moorings fitted with hydrophones set on the seabed at 400-490 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of: \n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and \n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian). \n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",
