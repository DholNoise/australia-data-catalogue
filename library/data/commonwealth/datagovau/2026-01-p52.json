    "title": "Australian lamb: Financial performance of lamb producers, 2013-14 to 2015-16 - Research report 16.9",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for lamb producers for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Lamb producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that sold, on average, 200 or more lambs for slaughter a year over the three years ending 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income of lamb producing farms rose on average over the period 2013-14 to 2014-15. The majority of the rise in farm incomes came from higher beef and lamb receipts due to increased prices and sales for both commodities. Average farm cash income of lamb producing farms is estimated to have increased further in 2015-16 mainly as a result of increased crop, wool and beef cattle sales. \r\n• Average incomes of lamb producing farms are estimated to have risen from 2014-15 to 2015-16 in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The majority of the increase in farm incomes in these states was from higher cropping receipts. \r\n• In real terms, the estimated average farm incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 were among the highest recorded since 2001-02. \r\n• Rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for lamb producers fell marginally from 2.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 2.5 per cent in 2014-15. The average rate of return is estimated to have increased in 2015-16 to around 3.0 per cent, reflecting higher incomes. \r\n• Average debt for lamb producers increased in real terms by around 88 per cent from $323 000 in 2000-01 (in 2015-16 dollars) to an estimated $605 000 in 2015-16. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of increases in average farm size and borrowing for land purchase, as well as for ongoing working capital. \r\n• Overall, changes in average debt over time have been modest relative to lamb producers' capacity to service debt by generating income. On average, around 8 per cent of lamb producers' farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments over the 10 years to 2015-16. In 2015-16 an estimated 6 per cent of farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments. \r\n",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.5.0) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe site is woodland savanna with an overstory co-dominated by tree species <em>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</em>, <em>Corymbia latifolia</em>, <em>Terminalia grandiflora</em>, <em>Sorghum sp.</em> and <em>Heteropogon triticeus</em>. Average canopy height measures 16.4&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is close to 110&nbsp; m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site is 1,170&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 31.2 &nbsp;°C (in June) to 37.5&nbsp;°C (in October), while minimum temperatures range from 12.6&nbsp;°C (in July) to 23.8&nbsp;°C (in January). Maximum temperatures range seasonally by 6.3&nbsp;°C and minimum temperatures by 11.2&nbsp;°C. The instrument mast is 23&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy.Ancillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the site in September 2008. ",

Broad grids and dense patch surveys were completed at each site, although an issue with the vessel, a fault with the vehicle’s battery and weather meant that not all sites were completed at Port Stephens.  We are looking to complete these in early 2011.The 2010/11 period has predominantly been spent establishing benthic reference sites at numerous sites around Australia using the AUV.\n\nThe SIRIUS overtook 13 dives and travelled for 36 kms. 79296 stereo pairs images were captured every around each 40cm at an average altitude of 2.2m.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trip the dataset included over 1TB of geotiff imagery, multibeam, AUV tracks, 3D textured meshes and hydrographical data (CDOM, Salinity, Temperature, .\n\nThe dive reports from this campaign summarise AUV activity during each dive.",

    "description": "This record describes the CTD data collected on Investigator voyage IN2025_V04, titled: \"Untangling the causes of change over 25 years in the southeast marine ecosystem - Voyage IV (SEA-MES Voyage 4).\" The voyage took place between May 27, 2025 and June 28, 2025 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart.\nData for 61 CTD deployments were acquired using the Sea-Bird SBE911 CTD unit #22, fitted with 36 twelve-litre bottles on the rosette sampler. Sea-Bird-supplied calibration factors were used to compute the pressures and preliminary conductivity values. CSIRO-supplied calibrations were applied to the temperature data. The data were subjected to automated QC to remove spikes and out-of-range values.\nMajority of casts were bottom approaches to 10m off bottom, some casts did not approach the bottom due to the operators deciding that conditions were too risky to attempt a bottom approach. The test cast was not attempted due to strong winds, hence cast #01 was a scientific cast.\nCast #61 no SUNA data is available for this cast.\nBetween cast #35 and #36 the pumped sensors were cleaned with freshwater. This did not affect the conductivity sensor but did the oxygen sensor, hence the final calibrations were based on a single deployment group for conductivity and multiple deployment groupings for oxygen. The final conductivity calibration from the secondary sensor had a standard deviation (SD) of 0.0030364 PSU, outside our target of ‘better than 0.002 PSU’. The standard product of 1-decibar binned averages were produced using data from the secondary sensors. The dissolved oxygen data calibration fit had a SD of 0.68397μM (#01-#35) and 0.79591μM (#36-#61). The agreement between the CTD and bottle data was good.\nPAR, CDOM, Transmissometer, Chlorophyll-a and Scattering sensors were also installed on the auxiliary A/D channels of the CTD.\nThe collected data were processed (quality-controlled), and subsequently archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).\nAdditional information regarding this dataset may be contained in the Voyage Summary and the Data Processing Report.",

    "title": "Photosynthetic and growth responses in three tropical seagrass species to pCO2 enrichment (440, 700, 890, 1204 µatm) (NERP TE 5.2, AIMS)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of one data file (spreadsheet) from a 2 week aquarium experiment manipulating pH (pCO2) changes and measuring photosynthetic and growth responses of three tropical seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii). \n\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased pCO2 would increase photosynthetic and growth rates to various extents between seagrass species.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nThis experiment exposed three seagrass species, Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis and Thalassia hemprichii, to four pCO2 treatments (440, 700, 890, 1204 µatm) for two weeks to investigate the effects of acidification on their physiology. These treatments were chosen to bracket the range of atmospheric CO2 levels predicted for different end-of-century emission scenarios in the near-future (2100). Each treatment was replicated across four aquaria, each with 2 duplicate pots per species.\n\nC. serrulata and H. uninervis were collected from the intertidal meadow at Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef (19°10.88¿S, 146°50.63¿E) in late March 2013. T. hemprichii was collected from Green Island in the Northern Great Barrier Reef (16°45.37¿S, 145°58.19¿E) in early April 2013. H. uninervis and sediment was collected as intact plugs. C. serrulata and T. hemprichii were collected by excavating intact shoots with connected horizontal rhizomes from the sediment. The experiment started two to four weeks after the collection.\n\nPhotosynthetic rates and respiration of the second youngest leaf of a haphazardly chosen shoot from each pot were measured using optical oxygen sensors. Photosynthetic rates were measured over a series of light steps (10, 30, 70, 110, 220, 400, 510 µmol m-2 s-1), with each light step lasting 20 minutes. Rates were normalised to the dry weight of the leaf, after drying leaves at 60°C for 48 hours. To determine photosynthetic parameters (Pmax, alpha, Ek, Ec), photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-E) data plots were fitted to the adapted hyperbolic tangent model equation of Jassby and Platt (1976). Net productivity (NP) was taken to be the photosynthetic rate measured at the experimental light level (400 µmol m-2 s-1). Energetic surplus (PG:R) was calculated as the ratio of gross productivity to dark respiration rate. \n\nTo measure growth rates, all shoots were marked at the top of the sheath with a needle at the start of the experiment. After 14 days, the shoots were harvested, the length of new tissue growth were excised, dried at 60°C for 48 hours and weighed for determination of weight of new leaf growth. Leaf tissue growth was normalised to the aboveground biomass to derive relative leaf growth rates (RGR). Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated by dividing total leaf area with the total biomass of the leaves.\n\nChlorophyll content was determined by acetone extraction of chlorophyll from a young mature leaf from each pot at the end of the experiment. \nTo determine non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content, roots and rhizomes were dried at 60°C for 48 hours, before being homogenised. Soluble carbohydrates were extracted with 80% ethanol at 80°C. The amount of soluble carbohydrates was assayed after removal of phenolic compounds and acid hydrolysis. Starch content was analysed from the residue of the soluble carbohydrate extraction through enzyme (amylase and amyloglucosidase) digestion. The concentration of glucose is measured using a commercially available glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) testing reagent (Megazyme). Absorbance was then measured at 510 nm. Total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) content was the sum of the amount of soluble carbohydrates and starch content.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nComma Separated File (CSV)\n\n\nData Dictionary:\n\nseagrass_pCO2only.csv:\n\n- pH: Average of the calculated pH of the aquarium over the experimental period.\n- pCO2 (uatm): average pCO2 levels over two weeks.\n- Temp_real (oC): Average of measured temperatures of the aquarium over the experimental period (N=3).

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from the Gloucester Deep Wells Completion Reports - Geology dataset (GUID: 0529ae9a-4d40-460d-b52a-fb0e5f646746). The source dataset is identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe data set consists of two files which correspond to the wells location and data (formation markers) used to identify the depth of formations used in the geologic model. \n\n\n\nFiles:\n\nWell_picks.txt\n\n\n\nContains the well name, datum and the calculated depths of formations form the datum identified from the well completion reports.\n\n\n\nWells_locations.kmz \n\n\n\nContains the locations for use in GoogleEarth.  Geographic coordinates are available in the original well completion reports.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nData were extracted from 25 well completion reports obtained for the Gloucester basin from the DIGS database.  Each report lists the depth of the various formations encountered during well drilling and the elevation at the surface.  Using these values the formation tops and bottoms were calculated and formatted accordingly for input into the geological model.  The file well_picks.txt represents the input data.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) GLO Deep Well Locations and Depths of Formations V01.

    "description": "This dataset consists of measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in southeast of Emerald, Queensland, using eddy covariance techniques.   \nThe Arcturus greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring station was established in July 2010, 48 km southeast of Emerald, Queensland, with flux tower measurements starting in June 2011 until early 2014. The station was part of a collaborative project between Geoscience Australia (GA) and CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR). Elevation of the site was approximately 170m asl and mean annual precipitation was 572mm. The tower bordered 2 land use types split N-S: To the west lightly forested tussock grasslands; To the east crop lands, cycling through fallow periods.The instruments were installed on a square lattice tower with an adjustable pulley lever system to raise and lower the instrument arm. The tower was 5.6m tall with the instrument mast extending a further 1.1m above, totalling a height of 6.7m. Fluxes of heat, water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide were measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy included temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, and the 4 components of net radiation. Soil heat flux, soil moisture and soil temperature measurements were also collected.  \nFor additional site information, see http://www.ozflux.org.au/monitoringsites/arcturus/index.html.

    "description": "    \n\nThis statistical table brings together aggregate data for banks, credit\nunions, building societies, corporations covered by the Financial Sector\n(Collection of Data) Act 2001 (known as Registered Financial Corporations\n(RFCs)) and other significant parts of the financial sector for which\naggregate data are published by the RBA, the ABS and APRA.\n\nCare should be exercised in drawing conclusions about relative sizes and rates\nof growth of institutions because of the different nature of their activities\nand different coverage of the various data collections. Coverage differences\ninclude: timing (e.g. most bank data are monthly averages until June 2000 and\nend-month thereafter); valuation; location (e.g. life office data before 1988\nonly covers assets in Australia, most other collections include overseas\nassets); and netting out of transactions within some groups. Coverage of some\nseries changes over time: in recent years aggregates for individual groups\nhave been significantly affected by conversion of non-banks to banks,\nreclassification between RFC categories and changes to reporting forms. Some\nfurther details of coverage can be obtained from statistical files dealing\nwith the relevant institutions.\n\naReserve Bank (RBA)a data for June 1996 adjusted for change in accounting\npolicy.\n\naBanks (other than RBA)a: up to 1985 inclusive refers to A$ assets in\nAustralia only. From 1989 equals the totals shown in statistical table B2.\n\naOther authorised deposit-taking institutionsa excludes some ADIs, including\nSCCIs. Data from December 1999 inclusive are drawn from APRAas quarterly\nreturn. These data will differ from the total assets figures presented in\nstatistical tables B7 and B8 because they include assets of all building\nsocieties and credit unions, whereas statistical tables B7 and B8 only include\ndata for building societies and credit unions with total assets greater than\nor equal to $50 million.\n\nFrom December 1999 data, aRFCsa cover registered corporations whose assets in\nAustralia (including related corporations) exceed $50 million. Prior to\nDecember 1999, this threshold was set at $5 million. In April 2003,\nresponsibility for the collection of financial statistics from RFCs was\ntransferred from the RB to APRA. Prior to April 2003, these data were\ncollected by the RB under the now repealed Financial Corporations Act 1974.\nThese changes have resulted in breaks in all series covering RFCs at April\n2003. aFinance companies and general financiersa includes corporations\nformerly registered as Category E (Pastoral Finance Companies), F (Finance\nCompanies) and G (General Financiers) under the Financial Corporations Act\n1974.\n\nThe assets of life offices and superannuation funds and other managed funds\nhave been consolidated by the ABS. As a result, these data should not be\ncompared to statistical tables B14aB18, which contain unconsolidated data.\n\naGeneral insurance officesa include both private and public sector offices.\nData are sourced from the ABS Financial Accounts and relate to financial\nassets only.\n\naSecuritisation vehiclesa (commonly referred to as issuers of asset-backed\nsecurities) are special purpose vehicles set up to securitise selected assets,\nincluding residential mortgages. Many of the securities issued by these\nvehicles are held by other institutions shown in the table. More detailed data\nare shown in statistical table B19.\n\n",

    "description": "Historical Imagery 1955\nCurrent and historic imagery form an important part of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data Framework and provide a valuable resource which is widely accessed by government and the broader community on a daily basis. As the completeness of this data base continues, its market demand also increases across a broad range of applications.\nSpatial Services aerial imagery was originally captured using a veriety of cameras includeing the Wild RC-5, RC-10 and Leica RC-30 cameras with a variety of lenses with focal lengths of 88mm, 153mm and 304mm. Images were captured in monochrome or colour during this period at a range of scales. Capture scales ranged from 1:5 000 to 1:80 000.\nThe Historical Air Photo Enhancement program (HAPE) not only allows the capability to search, discover and use source imagery, but also provides the delivery and viewing of enhanced historic rectified imagery mosaics. This new development means the community at large can now access and utilise spatially accurate historic imagery:\n1.   Through the Historical Imagery Viewer\n2.   Directly in a wide range for GIS Mapping applications as a Web map Tile Service (WMTS).

The City of Melbourne Social Indicator Survey (CoMSIS) provides insight into the health, wellbeing, participation and connection of residents in our city. This data is collected to directly address some of the Council Plan’s municipal outcome indicators and support our health and wellbeing priorities. Findings of the survey give insight into the perceived quality of life for our residents.\n\n2. The <a href=\"https://www.dataforcities.org/wccd/\">World Council on City Data (WCCD)</a> is a network of cities committed to improving services and quality of life with open city data and standardised urban indicators. The WCCD developed and oversees an international standard for city data: <i>ISO 37120 Sustainable Development of Communities: Indicators for City Services and Quality of Life.</i> The City of Melbourne is a member of this network and annually submits indicators for verification in accordance with this standard.\n\nRelated datasets: <b><a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/social-indicators-for-city-of-melbourne-residents-2018/information/\">Social Indicators for City of Melbourne Residents 2018</a></b>",

The mapping shows areas where a salinity hazard might exist if sufficient management is not applied, which could lead to soil resource degradation.  Assigned classes are; Low, Moderate and High as classified ratings of a salinity hazard index.  The index was generated by combining Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) inputs of the soil properties of Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Clay % for standard depths, with ratings developed by the DPIPWE Land Degradation and Salinity Risk assessments.  The mapping covers the entire state of Tasmania at 30m resolution.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed in 100m of water, approximately 2km offshore of Point Perpendicular, Jervis Bay. This mooring housed 3 current meters (at 30m, 55m and 90m water depth) and also a tide gauge. Over a period of approx. 8 months the mooring was deployed 3 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1 - 35.16 S, 150.817 E. \nDeployments 2 & 3 - 35.1267 S, 150.825 E. Datasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the three current meters over the study period.\n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 3 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2 & 3) for the upper two meters at 30m and 55m water depth. The current meter at 90m utilised sampling intervals of 10mins (deployments 1 & 2) and 30mins (deployment 3). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 11/4/89 - 5/6/89... 2) 28/7/89 - 29/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 29/11/89\n\nTIDE GAUGE: The tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~100m for all three deployments  In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Almost two thirds of convicts were English (along with a small number of Scottish and Welsh), with the Irish making up the remaining one third.\nConvicts were usually given sentences of transportation for seven, 14 years or life. Some convicts in the 1830s received ten-year sentences. About one quarter of the convicts were sentenced to ‘the term of their natural lives’, and a proportion of these had reprieves from the death sentence.\nThese seven indexes contain around 140,000 entries in total.",

    "description": "Access APIMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleFairfield Road Segment 3D May 2024Content TypeScene Layer/Scene Layer PackageDescriptionNSW Transport Theme Road Segment is a line feature class representing a section of road having common attributes and terminating at its physical and or at an intersection with another road at the same grade (same level). Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

The voyage took place between November 14 and November 26, 2017 departing from Fremantle (WA) and arriving in Hobart (TAS). \nThe Kongsberg SBP120 (sub bottom profiler) was used to acquire data containing the specular reflections at different sediment interfaces below the seafloor. The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP120 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\nData are stored in .raw (139 files 12.2 GB) raw and .seg (139 files 12.2 GB) segy formats at CSIRO. Dedicated shelf transects were run from 15/11/2018 until 20/11/2018.\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request",

These data resources include information on epidemiology and distribution of the pathogen as well as yield and grain quality loss caused by RLS.\nAccurate identification of RLS is indispensable for effective crop management. These data resources include information for RLS identification in Australian barley crops. This knowledge facilitates timely intervention for disease control, minimizes crop mismanagement, and mitigates losses in yield and grain quality due to RLS disease.\nThe datasets on this page include information on genetic and population diversity of Ramularia collo-cygni in Australia, disease incidence, triggers, potential regional relationships, and the quantification of economic losses stemming from this pathogen. Additionally, these resources include insights into the contributions of seeds, stubble, and alternate hosts in pathogen dissemination and disease development, as well as best practices for disease management and fungicide resistance.\nThese data resources result from collaborative research co-funded by the NSW Department of Primary Industries and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. These data resources include datasets which are available to download as well as metadata for resources which have restricted access and will be made available only on request.",

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nBabies are defined as small for gestational age if their birthweight is below the 10th percentile for their gestational age and sex, according to national birthweight percentiles. Includes singleton liveborn babies with known birthweight, gestational age and sex.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

    "title": "The ecology and impacts of the introduced basket clam, Corbula gibba in Port Phillip Bay, Australia",
    "description": "This thesis describes the ecology and impact of the introduced European basket clam, Corbula gibba (Olivi, 1792), in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. A bay-wide survey conducted in 1998 found C. gibba throughout the bay but it was significantly more abundant in deeper, muddier sites. Life history studies carried out at three sites found that two sites were dominated by a single cohort of large adults while the third site had one cohort of adults and one of juveniles.  This juvenile cohort grew at a rate of about 4 mm2 per month but experienced high mortality, with only 0.5% surviving a six month period. Longer term abundance patterns available at St. Leonards, and supplemented by this study, found that, between 1969 and 1999, adult density varied between 0 and 106 individuals per m2 while juveniles were found in varying densities in 5 of 6 years sampled. The effect of anthropogenic disturbance on resident populations and subsequent invasion by C. gibba into disturbed sites was assessed experimentally using scallop dredging. Scallop dredging did not affect resident populations but the impact on subsequent invasion by C. gibba could not be determined as recruitment failed to occur over the study period and adult migration was not observed. The effect of ambient densities of C. gibba on endemic species such as the commercial scallop, Pecten fumatus, was investigated experimentally in the field.  These experiments found that C. gibba significantly reduced the size and growth of juvenile P. fumatus to a greater extent than an equivalent number of conspecific scallops. Competition for shared food resources did not appear to be the mechanism underlying this impact, however, as dietary studies found that C. gibba was not a superior competitor. Additional studies found that C. gibba did not affect the recruitment of the native bivalves, Mytilus edulis and Electroma Georgiana, but significantly reduced conspecific recruitment. This effect is likely to have implications for the structure of C.gibba populations in the bay.",

During high rainfall events the catchment areas behave differently to deliver contaminants into the Port Jackson estuary. Under conditions of high rainfall contaminants are delivered to areas very quickly as freshwater slides over the top of the denser more saline waters of the estuary. Samples were taken along the Port Jackson estuary over two days to determine the behaviour of the freshwater plume as it travels in a layer of freshwater to be flushed or flocculate out at some point in the estuary. Samples were analysed for Al, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations.",

    "title": "Wallaby Creek Flux Data Release 2024_v2",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe forest is classed as a tall, wet sclerophyll forest, and the dominant <em>Eucalyptus Regnans</em> or mountain ash trees have an average canopy height of 75&nbsp;m. The site contains a chronosequence of (20, 80 and 300) stand ages that were established during fires occurring over the last 300 years. The area is assigned the IUCN Category II (National Parks) of the United Nations’ list of National Parks and protected areas, which means the park is primarily managed for ecosystem conservation. The catchment area is dominated by mountain ash, the world’s tallest flowering plant (angiosperm). Trees can reach heights of more than 90&nbsp;m in areas with high rainfall and fertile soil. Mountain ash forests are confined to the cool mountain regions with elevations ranging from 460 to 1100&nbsp;m and average rainfalls of 1100 to 2000&nbsp;mm/y. These trees are well distributed throughout Victoria’s Central Highlands including the Otway Ranges and Strzlecki Ranges; they are also found in Tasmania. The catchment area contains a portion of the Mt. Disappointment range, the Divide and the headwaters of Wallaby Creek and Silver Creek, and much of the slopes are characterised as flat to moderate.\n\nThe station itself is located within an old growth stand with individual trees as old as 300 years. Below the dominant canopy lies a temperate rainforest understorey consisting of <em>Pomaderris aspera</em> and <em>Olearia argophylla</em> species, which are 10 to 18&nbsp;m tall. The lower layers of vegetation are dominated by tree ferns (<em>Cyathea australis</em> and <em>Dicksonia antartica</em>) and extensive tracts of rosette and rhizonic ferns (<em>Polystichum proliferum</em> and <em>Blechnum wattsii</em>) as well as acacia trees. The elevation is approximately 720&nbsp;m. The major soil type within the forest is krasnozemic soils, which are friable red/brown soils, with high amounts of organic matter in the upper 20 to 30&nbsp;cm. However, the composition of krasnozemic soils is not homogenous, but rather varies with altitude. Grey-yellow podsolised soils can be found at lower altitudes, while krasnozemic loams is characteristic of the higher altitudes of the Kinglake and of the Hume Plateau. The clay content of these soils increases with depth until at least 200&nbsp;cm deep, where after a transition soils contain rock fragments. The climate of the study area is classified as a cool, temperate zone, with the highest temperatures occurring during the summer months of December – February (13.8 to 22.5&nbsp;°C), whilst the coolest temperatures are experienced in May and August (4.7 to 9.2&nbsp;°C). Average annual precipitation is 1209&nbsp;mm, with a maximum rainfall occurring in June (Ashton, 2000). The study site experiences foggy conditions after sunset during autumn and winter.\n\nThe original station had a main mast at 110&nbsp;m. This station was destroyed in February 2009 by bushfires. A replacement station was established in March 2010 and started recording in May 2010. The mast sat at a height of 5&nbsp;m. The post-fire instrumentation was not as diverse as the pre-fire instrumentation.",

    "description": "<b>Version Oct 2021</b>\nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Caboolture West Local Plan and  North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nFor more information refer to the values and constraints criteria in the relevant code in the planning scheme, see a range of <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/subsite.aspx?id=139941\">helpful information sheets</a> or contact Council. \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. Further details on the Qld Planning Provisions can be found <a href=\"https://www.dilgp.qld.gov.au/planning/state-planning-instruments/queensland-planning-provisions.html\">here</a>.",

    "title": "AIHW - Mental Health Services - Emergency Department Presentations (SA3) 2014-2018",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of emergency department presentations in public hospitals by patient location. Mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations are defined as presentations to public hospital EDs that have a principal diagnosis of mental and behavioural disorders. However, the definition does not fully capture all potential mental health-related presentations to EDs such as intentional self-harm, as intent can be difficult to identify in an ED environment and can also be difficult to code. The data spans the financial years of 2014-2018 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nState and territory health authorities collect a core set of nationally comparable information on most public hospital ED presentations in their jurisdiction, which is compiled annually into the National Non-Admitted Patient Emergency Department Care Database (NNAPEDCD). The data reported for 2014–15 to 2017–18 is sourced from the NNAPEDCD. Information about mental health-related services provided in EDs prior to 2014–15 was supplied directly to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) by states and territories.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCaution is required when conducting time-series analyses. The data source changed in 2014–15 from data provided by state and territory health authorities (2004–05 to 2013–14) to the NNAPEDCD. Additionally, due to the methodology applied for mapping the data over time, years prior to 2017–18 may be an undercount or data may not be displayed where SA3s have changed over time.\n\n\nMental health-related emergency department presentations included in this report are those that had a principal diagnosis that fell within the Mental and behavioural disorders chapter (Chapter 5) of ICD-10-AM (codes F00–F99) or the equivalent ICD-9-CM or SNOMED codes. It does not include codes for self-harm or poisoning.\n\n\nFrom 2014–15 onwards, diagnosis information was not reported using a uniform classification. The mapping of SNOMED codes (used by NSW) to ICD-10AM may lead to an under-estimation of mental health-related presentations.\n\n\nChanges in the volume of patients over time for NSW may be attributed, in part, to the increased number of hospitals included in the data for this jurisdiction.\n\n",

It was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to data supplied by the states and territories to allow seamless integration. \r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "The most common poverty measures, including that used by the OECD, focus on income based approaches.  One of the most common measures of income poverty is the proportion of households with income less than half median equivalised disposable household income (which is set as the poverty line); this is a relative income poverty measure as poverty is measured by reference to the income of others rather than in some absolute sense. Australia has one of the highest household disposable incomes in the world, which means that an Australian relative income poverty line is set at a high level of income compared to most other countries. \r\n\r\nOECD statistics on Australian poverty 2015-16 (based on ABS Survey of Income and Housing data and applying a poverty line of 50% of median income) determined the Australian poverty rate was over 25% before taxes and transfers, but falls around 12% after taxes and transfers. Though measuring poverty through application of solely an income measure is not considered comprehensive for an Australian context, however, it does demonstrate that the Australian welfare system more than halves the number of Australians that would otherwise be considered as at risk of living in poverty under that measure.  \r\nIt is important to consider a range of indicators of persistent disadvantage to understand poverty and hardship and its multidimensional nature. Different indicators point to different dimensions of poverty. \r\nWhile transient poverty is a problem, the experience of persistent poverty is of deeper concern, particularly where families experience intergenerational disadvantage and long-term welfare reliance.  HILDA data from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research shows the Distribution of number of years in poverty 2001–2015. The figure focuses on the longer term experience of working age adults and shows that while people do fall into poverty, only a small proportion of people are persistently poor.\r\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in March 2009, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study Norman Sub-Model. This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "These data sets include the picoplankton component analysed by flow cytometry from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. \nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is freely available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au",

Local weather, such as rainfall or frost, can vary widely over short distances. The weather stations are sited to provide good geographical coverage. Their data is sent to the Bureau of Meteorology for use in weather forecasting and climate studies.\n\nIndustry uses this data for time critical agribusiness decision-making. These can range from scheduling irrigation of vegetable crops, through to choosing the right conditions for spraying operations in broad scale crops.

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>Fusarium</strong> model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information about this hemi-pelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core and the percentage of carbonate material in each sample. XRD analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

    "title": "Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 19 August 2015.",
    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n The dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\nThe Clarence-Moreton Asset database V6.1 supersedes the previous version (Asset database for the Clarence-Moreton bioregion on 11 December 2014, minor version v20150603 GUID = 248361ac-2495-4228-a4e4-e3c6cabf7433) of the Asset database. \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v6.1  of the Asset database (CLM_asset_database_20150819.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (CLM_asset_database_20150819_GISOnly.gdb), the Water Dependant Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-CLM-CLM-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150819.xlsx), a data dictionary (CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Clarence-Morton are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Clarence-Morton subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database M1 and M2 have both been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"CLM_asset_database_doc_20150819.doc\" located in the zip file. Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nOBJECTID\tVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t1\t2/07/2014\tInitial database.\n\n2\t2\t15/08/2014\tInitial database with new WSP assets\n\n3\t3\t9/09/2014\tadd 87 line assets from early  SEQLD WAIT data ; updated NSW RegERiv and GWMP assets, and changed AID (5010 to 5180 to 15010 to 15180)\n\n4\t3.1\t15/09/2014\t\" Updated  class \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems\"\" to \"\"Groundwater-dependent ecosystem\"\"\"\n\n5\t4\t20/02/2015\tAdd additional eight datasets from the community consultation and assessment team: QLD RE 11, NSW GDE, QLD Wetland System 100K, QLD GDE Surface Areas, QLD GDE Line, QLD GDE Terrestrial Areas, NGIS QLD Bores and AHGF Network Stream.
