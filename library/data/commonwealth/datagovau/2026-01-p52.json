    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2005 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

This cruise was the third in a 3 year series of IMOS AUV Facility cruises intended to establish a benthic habitat timeseries along the Eastern and Western coasts of Australia. These surveys have been repeated annually for three years. Surveys were conducted off Rottnest Island, Jurien Bay, and the Abrolhos Islands. Sites were surveyed at each location spanning three depths (15 m, 25 m, 40 m), both inside and outside MPAs, with three 25 m x 25 m full photo coverage quadrants devoted to each site. Site locations targeted kelp beds and were provided by the science party. The locations of individual quadrants within each site were selected to repeat surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011. Additional scientific operations carried out during the cruise consisted of CTD casts.",

The East Coast Flood Recovery Program 2023-2024 was a comprehensive program supporting long-term recovery from the 2022 floods by monitoring water quality in disaster-declared catchments along the East Coast of NSW. This dashboard presents data for three regions: The North Coast, Mid-Coast and Hawkesbury-Nepean River. The data available on the dashboard collates multiple water quality parameters from thousands of samples collected throughout the project, including water clarity (turbidity), algae (chlorophyll-a), nutrients and bacteria. This data has been collected through manual field sampling by the project team and in real-time via telemetered water quality loggers (2 land-based sites and 6 smart buoys).",

    "title": "Potential displacement of commercial fisheries by a Commonwealth marine reserve zoning scheme",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The Government commissioned an independent review of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves that were originally proclaimed in November 2012. The Department of the Environment commissioned ABARES to assess potential displacement of commercial fishing by alternative marine reserve designs and zoning options considered by the Bioregional Advisory Panel. The report details potential displacement by the network proclaimed in 2012 and the network recommended by the Panel in 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  • The potential impact of the Panel recommended (2015) zoning on commercial fisheries in the regions is relatively small, compared with the total gross value of production (GVP) from all wild capture fisheries. However, while much of the total impact is diffuse, some of the potential impact is concentrated in particular fisheries, entitlement holders and towns. \r\n• The Panel recommended (2015) zoning would potentially displace an estimated annual average 587.6 t of catch, with an annual average GVP of $4.51 million. This is less than the proclaimed network (2012), which would displace 1032 t of catch, with a GVP of $8.21 million. \r\n• For individual entitlements, there are a large number for which the potential impacts of the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning are relatively low (more than 700 entitlements with less than $2500 displaced per year) and a small number of entitlements for which the potential impacts are higher (17 entitlements over $50 000). The largest displacement from one entitlement was $164 000. These figures do not include South Australian entitlements because ABARES did not receive fisheries data at this scale for South Australian fisheries. A single business unit may hold multiple entitlements and so the impact on a business unit would be the sum of the individual entitlement impacts. \r\n• At the fishery level, the largest GVP displacements from the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning would be from the Western Australian West Coast Rock Lobster Fishery ($823 000), Commonwealth Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery ($585 800) and Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery ($488 200). \r\n• In terms of the proportion of GVP from the entire fishery, the largest displacements would be from the Commonwealth Coral Sea Fishery (71.2 per cent of fishery GVP), Western Australian North Coast Shark Fishery (33.9 per cent) and the Western Australian South West Trawl Fishery (13.2 per cent). \r\n• Towns with the highest potential GVP displacement were Mooloolaba in Queensland ($515 100), Geraldton in Western Australia ($449 200) and Fremantle in Western Australia ($406 300). \r\n• The estimated net economic impact of the Panel-recommended network would be reduced regional economic activity of $7.9 million in the short term. Potential short term employment impacts were separately estimated at 18 total jobs (estimate derived from previous economic modelling) and 49 jobs (estimate derived from previous surveys of fishers). Changes in economic activity at the state / territory level are expected to be negligible in terms of the size of the economies. These estimates have been made by rescaling previous economic modelling and survey results (from 2012); ABARES was not commissioned to undertake new economic modelling or surveys. \r\n\r\n Note: This document is hosted on the Department of Environment website.

    "description": "This dataset presents the statistics of hospitalisations with a principal diagnosis associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) excluding principal diagnosis of dialysis distributed by sex and age for the years between 2012-2015. The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

    "title": "AusUrbHI Spatial Variation in Indicators of Breast Cancer Outcomes for Women in Queensland (SA2) 2000-2019",
    "description": "The Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project, a collaboration between NCRIS facilities, AURIN, PHRN, and researchers, aims to improve understanding of urban and regional health. This dataset, developed with Cancer Council Queensland and the Australian Cancer Atlas, provides spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes in Queensland, exploring associations between various determinants and cancer patterns. The dataset’s goal is to identify spatial variations in breast cancer outcomes within Queensland, and motivate further research into their drivers.\nThis dataset includes seven spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes for Queensland women, modeled using Bayesian statistics, covering the period of 2000-2019. These indicators, presented as Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) with 95% credible intervals and posterior probability differences (ppd), are at the Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2). The dataset provides modelled statistical indicators and geographic data, covering breast cancer outcomes, spatial epidemiology, health disparities, and cancer surveillance at the SA2 level (2016 ASGS) in Queensland, Australia. The intended application is for identifying geographical disparities in breast cancer, informing public health planning, and enabling further research.\nThe methodology uses linked health datasets from the Queensland Cancer Register, BreastScreen Queensland, and the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patients Data Collection. Bayesian spatial models with Besag-Yorke-Mollié (BYM) priors were applied, using a Poisson distribution with the log of expected counts as an offset, and incorporating spatial terms for neighboring regions. Models were validated using trace plots, density plots, Moran’s I statistics, and Geweke statistics.\nThe data is structured as a table, with each row representing an SA2 region, and columns representing indicator values and associated metrics. The complete attribute dictionary for the dataset is shown below:\n\nsa2: Five digital sa2 code using 2016 ASGS\nsa2name: Name of each sa2 area\n\nurban: Categorical variable with three levels: 1. brisbane/gold coast; 2. Cairns; 3. Rest of Queensland, with the first two representing the urban areas in Queensland. Categorised based on sa3 name.\n\n\nsir_incidence: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in incidence of breast cancer. SIR is using the total Queensland cohort as the reference population.\n\nlow_cri_incidence: The lower bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_incidence.\nhigh_cri_incidence: The higher bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_incidence.\n\nppd_incidence: The posterior probability difference of sir_incidence outcome, with ppd&gt;0.6 showing a significant difference from the Queensland average.\n\n\nsir_localised: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in proportion of invasive breast cancers that were diagnosed when localised. SIR is using the total Queensland cohort as the reference population.\n\nlow_cri_localised: The lower bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_localised.\nhigh_cri_localised: The higher bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_localised.\n\nppd_localised: The posterior probability difference of sir_localised outcome, with ppd&gt;0.6 showing a significant difference from the Queensland average.\n\n\nsir_survive5yrs: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in surviving at least five years among women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. SIR is using the total Queensland cohort as the reference population.\n\nlow_cri_survive5yrs: The lower bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_survive5yrs.\nhigh_cri_survive5yrs: The higher bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_survive5yrs.\n\nppd_survive5yrs: The posterior probability difference of sir_survive5yrs outcome, with ppd&gt;0.6 showing a significant difference from the Queensland average.\n\n\nsir_hospitalization: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in hospitalization rates among women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.

    "title": "Darling River Snail Indicative Distribution in NSW",
    "description": "The Darling River Snail (also known as ‘River Snail’) is a mediumsized (20-25 mm) freshwater snail that was once common and\nwidespread in the Darling River and its tributaries. However\npopulations declined rapidly over the last few decades, probably as a\nresult of weir building and other activities associated with river flow\nmanagement. They are now virtually extinct throughout their natural\nrange. In the last decade, living specimens have only been found\nfrom within irrigation pipelines in southern NSW. They are a critically\nendangered species – www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/threatenedspecies/threatened-species-list/critically/river-snail/river-snail\nThe methods used to create the predicted current distribution of the\nDarling River Snail are described fully in: NSW Department of\nPrimary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community Status 2015 – Final\nReport.\nAll available records of the species were collated and assessed for\naccuracy. For current distribution, only records after 1 January 1994\nwere used. Within the framework of the Australian Hydrological\nGeospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network, the records were\nassociated with attributes from the National Environmental Stream\nAttributes Database and River Styles® geomorphology. The\nAustralian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology\nnetwork (Geofabric) is a fully connected and directed stream network\nbased a 9 second DEM. It allocates a unique stream segment\nnumber to each river reach in Australia. The Environmental\nAttributes Database is a set of lookup tables supplying attributes describing the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the\nstream and catchment environment that was developed by the\nAustralian National University (ANU) in 2011 and updated in 2012.\nThe data is supplied as part of the supplementary Geofabric\nproducts which is associated with the 9 second DEM derived\nstreams and the National Catchment Boundaries based on 250k\nscale stream network. 30 Stream variables were assessed for the\nmodelling.\nRiver Styles® provides a high resolution categorical classification of\nriver character within a nested hierarchy of criteria based on valley\nsetting, channel planform, geomorphic units, and bed material. The\nNSW Office of Water compiled a spatial dataset of River Styles®\nclassifications for a large number of the waterways of NSW. From 65\nRiver Style® categories we generated two new fields representing\nPlanform (34 categories) and Substratum (8 categories) for each\nstream segment. River Style® planform and substratum categories\nwere then assigned to each Geofabric segment.\nMaxEnt 3.3.3 is a widely used species distribution modelling program\nthat utilises presence records to generate probabilities of occurrence\nbased on a suite of environmental variables quantified across the\narea of interest. It was used to model the current geographic\ndistribution of each listed threatened freshwater aquatic species or\npopulation. We utilised logistic output to plot the predicted\ndistribution of each species. This output equates to a probability that\nthe species will be observed in each river reach, given the\nenvironmental conditions that exist there relative to the\nenvironmental conditions where the species is known to occur. For\nthis mapping, above 33% probability was considered predicted\npresence. Only stream segments with a modelled average daily flow\nof more than five megalitres were selected for output. In addition,\npredicted separate populations were connected by manual\ninterpretation. The predicted values for each river reach were\nconverted from the Geofabric framework to the higher resolution\n2013 NSW Strahler Stream Order Hydroline.",

Division of Fisheries and Oceanography was set up to investigate the relationship between kelp: Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh 1820 and crayfish larvae. Alginates (Australia) P/L, based at Louisville in the Mercury Passage, were harvesting kelp at this time. This study was initiated to address concerns regarding the effect of harvesting on crayfish stocks.\nThe survey results are taken from an unpublished interim report presenting the results of the work at that stage (1965).\nApparently an aerial survey was used to determine stock distributions although this is not specified in the report.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual fishing effort by fishery and gear, that fishers have recorded in their logbooks for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea. Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nFishing effort is measured differently depending on the fishing method used. In this dataset we provide the most common measures that are used by scientists. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe effort data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Effort data are used in combination with catch data, spatial data, and other relevant information (such as independent surveys) to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time-period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may standardise effort for assessments to account for issues such as changes in gear efficiency, catchability of fish and skipper expertise. They may also filter out effort from their assessments because of data quality issues.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect effort each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as closures of fishing areas or reducing boat numbers. Similarly, changes in market demand can change fishing decisions and affect effort. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in April and May 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022009 Leg 1.\n\nDeparted: \tLautoka Fiji, April 22, 2009\nArrived:  \tNuku'Alofa, Tonga, May 18, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This thesis examines the relationships between human use and biological changes in the rocky intertidal zone of the Bunurong Marine Park, Victoria  between January 1990 and June 1991. The key areas of activities were to i) describe the  types and patterns of human activities on the reef,  ii) assess the impact  and recovery of reef biota to these activities with particular focus on Hormosira banksii, the dominant algal community and  iii) determine the natural fluctuations in reef communities to provide a baseline to detect future changes in response to protection.\r\n\r\nSurveys of human activities between January 1990 and April 1991 found walking to be the most common activity.  Levels of human use were greatest during school holidays followed by weekends and were lowest during term weekdays.  During school holidays use varied with the time of day and use on term weekend depended on weather.  \r\n\r\nThe impact of collecting intertidal gastropods and trampling were investigated.  There was no relationship between the observed patterns of human use and variations in the size distributions of collected and non-collected intertidal gastropods.  Experimental trampling showed that the dominant alga on these reefs, Hormosira banksii, was severely affected by trampling.  The cover of Hormosira was reduced by trampling and the decrease in cover depended on the level of trampling.  No significant effects of trampling were detected for any other species.   Trampled beds of Hormosirra banksii took well over a year to recover to the same level as adjacent mats. \r\n\r\nAlgal monitoring showed that the cover of Hormosira was stable over time, except for a large decrease due to desiccation in summer.  These findings are discussed in relation to the management of the Bunurong Marine National Park.",

    "title": "AIHW - Health Risk Factors - Adults who are Overweight or Obese Crude (%) (PHN) 2011-2015",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who are overweight or obese. Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30, or obese if their BMI was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

The positioning data under the NSW Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF) is fed to the web service by the Survey Control Information Management System (SCIMS), the database that contains the single source of truth for all marks within the state control survey network.\nThis service provides GDA94 coordinates, heights and related information for NSW survey marks that form the official State control survey network (as reported in SCIMS). This service controls the precision of numerical output in a manner that mirrors SCIMS Online available through the Spatial Services Portal.\nThe web service provides a wealth of data on each mark, including:\n<ul><li>Mark type (Permanent Mark, State Survey Mark, etc.) </li><li>Mark number </li><li>Horizontal coordinates and their accuracy (class and order) </li><li>Heights and their accuracy (class and order) </li><li>Status of the mark (destroyed, restricted access, etc.) </li></ul>\n\nThe Mark type is represented using various shapes and the accuracy of the mark (both vertical and horizontal) is communicated by the colour. \nThis web service allows users to easily integrate survey control mark data from SCIMS into Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant spatial platforms and applications. \nData provided by the NSW Survey Mark web service can be used in a variety of engineering and surveying applications, including but not limited to: \n<ul><li>Cadastral survey planning </li><li>Flood studies and hydrographic modelling </li><li>Infrastructure development</li><li>Site calibration at construction sites </li><li>Elevation modelling </li><li>Preservation of survey infrastructure</li></ul>\n\nThe NSW Survey Mark web service gives users an alternative method to access state control survey data that can be incorporated into their GIS package without needing to log into SCIMS Online.\n<b>Please note that SCIMS Online is the official option for obtaining state control survey data for cadastral surveys as it offers legal traceability.

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWomen who gave birth at 32 weeks or more gestation to a livebirth or a stillbirth, with known number of antenatal visits (includes women with no antenatal care).\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011.

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The commissioning of new dedicated FRB detection systems has led to an exponential increase in the detected FRBs over the last decade. Despite &gt;700 FRBs published to date, there is still a lack of understanding about the physical mechanisms through which FRB emission is produced. Due to the possibility of detecting multiple bursts from the same source in a repeating FRB, it forms an ideal sample set to uncover the physics of the source (e.g., emission mechanism, progenitor surrounding media), and test possible progenitor models. The coherent upgrade to the FRB detection system to ASKAP is expected to detect ~1-2 FRB/week. However, due to the limited fractional bandwidth available with ASKAP and survey nature of the telescope, probing the spectro-polarimetric characteristics of repeating sources is non-optimal. Hence, the large bandwidth offered by the ultra wideband-low (UWL) on Parkes/Murriyang is an ideal instrument to follow-up repeating FRB sources discovered through CRACO. Over the next ~6 months, we expect to double the number of repeaters that have been studied through the UWL. This will provide unprecedented insight into the progenitor environment and the surrounding media of repeating FRBs. We propose using the UWL to follow up repeater-like sources to study their wideband spectro-polarimetric characteristics.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

The RSF is an important component of the PWS visitor risk management policy and is related to the Recreational Opportunity Spectrum (ROS). Sites are  attributed with their level of acceptable public risk, neutral, moderate, substantial or severe. This layer is an important strategic recreation management tool, that defines the level of expectation and service levels for each site classification. The sites represent the land footprints of a visitor activity (ie campsites, visitor centres, picnic areas etc). In addition the footprints of management activity are also included (ie. workshops, offices, staff housing). Refer to attached document links for more detail on the site classifications. Sites are on reserved and crown land.\n\nView Dataset (permission required):\nhttps://maps.thelist.tas.gov.au/listmap/app/list/map?bmlayer=3&amp;layers=2410\n\nAMS Data Structure:\nhttps://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/public/PWS_AMS_Data_Structure.pdf",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.3) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n \n The flux station is located within an area of dryland agriculture. The surrounding area is dominated by broadacre farming practices. The vegetation cover is predominantly pasture. Elevation of the site is close to 330 m. Climate information comes from the nearby Pingelly BoM AWS station 010626 (1991 to 2016) and shows mean annual precipitation is approximately 445 mm with highest rainfall in June and July of 81 mm each month. Maximumum and minuimum annual rainfall is 775 and 217 mm, respectively. Maximum temperatures range from 31.9°C (in Jan) to 15.4°C (in July), while minimum temperatures range from 5.5°C (in July) to 16.0 °C (in Feb).",

    "description": "This dataset consists of an atlas of the habitat quality of the urbanized and agricultural landscapes of the Mission beach region in August 2006, 6 months after cyclone Larry. This analysis and classification includes habitat quality, canopy cover, vegetation quality, vegetation types, tenure type and aerial photography at a resolution of 0.5m.\n\nThese maps of habitat quality highlight potential priority areas for maintenance and/or restoration of connectivity and is a tool for natural resource managers to implement restoration goals at Mission beach.\n\nAll the PDF maps for this atlas can be accessed from the \"Mission Beach - Habitat Quality Atlas page\".\nhttp://eatlas.org.au/mission-beach_jcu_habitat-quality-2006_atlas\n\nThis work was undertaken as part of MTSRF Project 4.9.3. The remote sensing analyses used a novel computerized Anaglyph technique for stereoscopic classification of aerial photographs flown 6 months after Category 4 cyclone Larry. Vegetation polygons of canopy cover and vegetation type were digitized. GIS-based rapid assessment of habitat quality combined vegetation quality with remnant area or riparian width, an analysis providing an excellent surrogate of field-determined habitat quality in rural areas unaffected by cyclones. Field-truthing of the remotely sensed data at 44 sites in coastal Mission beach included rapid transect assessments of vegetation structure, disturbance and microclimate parameters. Repeated bird surveys over 2 years provided an indicator of faunal habitat quality.\n\n\nData Units:\n\nEach map consists of a 1 km x 1 km section of the Mission beach region with the following classifications:\n* Habitat Quality: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor, Cleared\n* Percentage Canopy Cover\n* Shape/Size index\n* Vegetation Quality Index: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor, Cleared\n* Vegetation Types: Rainforest, Sclerophyll Rainforest, Sclerophyll Open Forest, Sclerophyll Woodland, Sclerophyll Open Woodland, Melaleuca Woodland, Melaleuca Swamp Open Forest, Melaleuca Swamp Woodland, Melaleuca Swamp Open Woodland, Grassland, Beach Ridge & Swale, Mangrove, Samphire, Plantation, Cleared\n* Aerial Photography (0.5 m resolution)\n* Tenure: Freehold Land, Reserve State Lease, State Land\n\n\nReferences:\n- Goosem, M., Habitat quality and potential improvements to connectivity in the Mission Beach area, MTSRF Conference 2010",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC10) was collected from a depth of 335 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Isotopic values for 18O and 13C were obtained from Gs. ruber and correlated with the SPECMAP age-model. Radiocarbon dating of G. sacculifer was also undertaken at three sample depths, and then corrected and correlated with the curve. This yielded an age vs. depth profile from which it was possible to determine approximate sedimentation rates. The results place the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) date at 130cm and highlights a peak in sedimentation rate during the penultimate glacial / interglacial transition. Down the core the sedimentation rates vary considerably from a high of 12 cm/kyr down to <1 cm/kyr. This is probably the result of a considerable change in the sediment flux related to the sea level fluctuations.",

    "description": "The River Murray Channel Monitoring Plan (RMCMP) focuses on monitoring River Murray system scale responses to coordinated water for environment delivery in the Southern Connected Murray-Darling Basin. It builds on existing monitoring programs to fill gaps and to evaluate ecological responses to flow at as system scale, to inform and improve the way water for the environment is managed.\r\n\r\nImplementation of the RMCMP is expected to significantly improve monitoring coverage in the River Murray, focusing on productivity and fish indicators that will directly inform improved management and coordination of flows. Implementation is expected to focus on 2021-22 in the first instance, with commitments for future years not yet made. A key element of the Plan is an annual review of implementation, which will inform any refinements to the Plan over the five year period.\r\n\r\nThe RMCMP, jointly funded by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) and Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), examines the productivity and fish responses to flow in the River Murray Channel. Monitoring occurs at 4 reaches: 1) Hume to Torrumbarry, 2) Torrumbarry to Euston, 3) Euston to SA border and 4) SA border to Wellington. The data set includes fish census (abundance, length), ageing (otolith) and length/weight data. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dcceew.gov.au/water/cewo/publications/river-murray-channel-monitoring-plan-2021-22-to-2025-26\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH RMCMP (2023) <INSERT DATASET TITLE>.

    "description": "This Pre-Clearing map represents the pre-clearing extent of the State Vegetation Type Map (SVTM).  Both SVTM and SVTM (Pre-Clearing) map each Plant Community Type, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation at a regional scale across all tenures in NSW. Pre-clearing PCT mapping is available for both eastern NSW and Far Western NSW. Coverage of Central NSW is a work in progress. \n\nPre-clearing extent of PCTs was developed using a combination of aerial photographic interpretation, environmental layers and historical documents. This map is updated periodically as part of the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/integrated-bionet-vegetation-data-for-nsw\">Integrated BioNet Vegetation Data</a> program to improve quality and alignment to the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy. \n\nFurther information and technical documents about the SVTM is available from the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/state-vegetation-type-map\">State Vegetation Type Mapping Program Page</a>\n\n<strong>Current Release C2.0.M2.2 (December 2025)</strong>\n\nThis release includes revisions, using the most recent NSW PCT Classification Master list (represented by “C2.0” in the version release number). PCT spatial distributions were manually edited based on user and community feedback since the previous C2.0.M2.1 release. \n\nDetailed technical information is available <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/nsw-state-vegetation-type-map-technical-notes-2025\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>Data Access</strong>\n\nMap data may be downloaded, viewed within the SEED Map Viewer, or accessed via the underlying ArcGIS REST Services or WMS for integration in GIS or business applications. \n\nThe Trees Near Me NSW app provides quick access to view the map using a mobile device or desktop. Download the app from Google Play or the App Store, or access the web site at <a href=\"https://www.treesnearme.app/explore\">https://treesnearme.app</a>.\n\n<strong>Map Data Type</strong>\n\nThe map is supplied as ESRI Feature Class (Quickview) and 5m GeoTiff Raster, and can be viewed and analysed in most commercial and open-source spatial software packages. If you prefer to use the download package, we supply an ArcGIS v10.8 mxd and/or a layer file for suggested symbology. The raster attributes contain PCT, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation.\n\n<strong>Feedback and Support</strong>\n\nWe welcome your feedback to assist us in continuously improving our products. To help us track and process your feedback, please use the SEED Data Feedback tool available via the SEED map viewer or the Feedback function in Trees Near Me NSW. \n\nFor further support, contact the BioNet Team at <em><a href=\"mailto:bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au</a></em>.\n\n<strong>Useful Related Data</strong>\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-state-vegetation-type-map\">NSW State Vegetation Type Map</a>: regional scale map of extant NSW Plant Community Types, Vegetation classes and Vegetation Formations.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-bionet-flora-survey-data-collection-pctreferencesites\">NSW BioNet Flora Survey Plots – PCT Reference Sites</a>: full floristic plots used in the development of the quantitative Plant Community Type (PCT) classification.

    "description": "Regional Development Australia (with LGA's) 2015-16 (April 2016) \r\n\r\nRegional Development Australia (RDA) is an Australian Government initiative that brings together all levels of government to enhance the growth and development of Australia's regions. A national network of RDA committees has been established to achieve this objective. \r\n\r\nRDA Regions are created and maintained by the Dept. of Infrastructure and Regional Development to support this initiative. \r\n\r\nNotes \r\n\r\nThe RDA Regions (2015-16) were built from the ABS/PSMA LGA 2015 boundary dataset. \r\n\r\nThe RDA spatial data is updated as new LGA boundaries are released by ABS or as RDA regional boundaries move. \r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August 2011, the RDA representation of Lord Howe Island, previously RDA Northern Rivers was changed to RDA Mid North Coast. The 2011 dataset was updated to reflect this change. \r\n\r\nNT, Tas and ACT \r\n\r\nThese states and territories are defined as single RD regions. West Daly RC, which deamalgamated from Victoria-Daly RC was added 1/7/14.\r\n\r\nIn Tas, Macquarie Island is part of the Huon Valley LGA (due to historical decisions)\r\n\r\nSA \r\n\r\nRDA regions are not completely defined within LGA boundaries, with some RDA regions being defined from the previously existing 2007 South Australia Government Region boundaries. Thus, the large unincorporated LGA (Outback Communities Authority) is divided between 3 RDAs (see SA Government Regions for more information). \r\n\r\nMore work has also been done on identifying Outback Community Authority islands (which have been incorporated into their respective RDA's)\r\n\r\nNSW \r\n\r\nRDA South Coast includes the external territory of Jervis Bay. In previous data releases, Lord Howe Island (part of the ABS Unincorporated NSW) was part of RDA Northern Rivers. On the 16 of August 2011, Lord Howe Island was to be represented by Mid North Coast and is under the control of the LHI Board. \r\n\r\nNorfolk Island IS NOT YET part of any RDA \r\n\r\nThere has also been more work around Sydney Harbour identifying NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and Sydney Harbour Trust Islands.  The remainder of Unincorporated NSW now falls under the control of NSW Trade and Investment: Crown Lands\r\n\r\nVIC \r\n\r\nUnincorporated VIC (Snow fields and Islands) have been combined into their surrounding RDA's \r\n\r\nWA \r\n\r\nThe external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos/Keeling Islands are part of RD Mid West Gascoyne. \r\n\r\nRottnest Is has been separated from the City of Cockburn (as it is governed by an Authority), and Carnac, Edwards and Lancelin Islands have been identified as falling under the control of DPaW.\r\n\r\nThere was also an amalgamation between the City of Geraldton-Greenough and Shire of Mullewa on the 1st of July 2011 to form the City of Greater Geraldton. The LGA code for Geraldton-Greenough (53520) was retained for the new City of Greater Geraldton. \r\n\r\nQLD \r\n\r\nOn the 1/1/14, 4 councils deamalgamated. Mareeba Shire reformed from Tablelands Regional, Douglas Shire reformed from Cairns Regional, Livingstone Shire from Rockhampton Regional and Noosa Shire from Sunshine Coast Regional. LGA boundaries had minor adjustments from the 2007 boundaries, but there were no changes to the RDA boundaries. \r\n",

    "title": "Bundaberg Urban Glow Data",
    "description": "This dataset represents measurements collected from a network of 75 urban glow sensors within the Bundaberg Region. The principal data sets are point data representing the readings from the Sky Quality Meter (SQM) sensors. Data from all sensors are processed every 15 minutes using natural neighbour interpolation to generate a raster of urban glow across two sub-networks (City and Coastal).\r\n\r\n__Vector Point Data__\r\n\r\nThe point data are contained as individual feature classes for each processing time within an ArcGIS file geodatabase\r\n\r\n* ID: The SQM site identifier\r\n* Description: The locality and the number of the SQM in that locality.\r\n* deviceGroup: The categorisation of the SQM devices for processing of the data within sub-networks (i.e. coastal network or city network)\r\n* obsLocalTime: The date and time in Australian Eastern Standard time (UTC+10) of the observation\r\n* magnitude: SQM reading is a numeric value indicating the relative brightness of the night sky. Lower numbers indicate a brighter sky, while higher numbers indicate a darker sky. A dark sky with minimal light pollution typically registers as 22 or above. Units are measured in magnitudes per square arc second.\r\n* skyTemp: The temperature of the nearest object (i.e. clouds) in a 10 degree field of view above the sensor. This value will be low if there is nothing, but higher if there is cloud.\r\n* ambTemp: Measurement of ambient air temperature taken at the specified point in time.\r\n* cloudCover: skyTemp & ambTemp reading values are translated as follows:\r\n    * no cloud cover\r\n    * minimal effects from cloud cover\r\n    * moderate/medium effects from cloud cover\r\n    * high impact from cloud cover\r\n\r\n__Raster Data__\r\n \r\nA Natural Neighbour interpolation has been performed using the sites with valid SQM values to produce a Geotiff raster to depict the hot spots or bright areas of urban glow\r\n\r\n__Mapbooks__\r\n\r\nThe input points and the generated hotspot raster are compiled into a nightly PDF map book for easy interpretation of the results.\r\n\r\nThe Reducing Urban Glow project page can be found here https://www.bundaberg.qld.gov.au/environment/reducing-urban-glow",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated lucerne</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST012008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, April 10, 2008\nArrived:  \tSydney, New South Wales, April 14, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program seeks to understand the potential impacts associated with developing unconventional energy resources in key Australian basins. As a potential source of land use change, future seismic data acquisition may cause cumulative land change that may need to be quantified for such a holistic impact assessment. Given the extent of seismic exploration for conventional resources within the Cooper Basin, existing data could provide insight into survey parameters that may be representative of future surveys in the region. We perform an analysis of the historical seismic survey occurrence and acquisition parameters for the existing data in the Cooper GBA region. The spatio-temporal data analysis is used to derive a simple model that could be used as a forecasting tool for seismic survey parameters of interest (e.g. line kilometers) in a forward looking risk assessment.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis presents a data analysis of the datasets: \r\n•\tSeismic survey 3D - QLD\r\n•\tSeismic survey 2D - QLD\r\n•\tSouth Australian 2D Seismic Lines \r\n•\tSouth Australia 3D Seismic Survey Areas\r\n•\tPetroleum well locations – Queensland\r\n•\tPetroleum well locations - South Australia",

    "description": "This data was collected in August 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST022010.\n\nDeparted:  Fremantle, Australia, August 10, 2010\nArrived:  \tHobart, Australia, August 20, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

These surveys are run conjunction with the Eastern Australian Waterbird Survey (EAWS) since 1983.\r\n\r\nThe sourcing of this data was done predominately through a third-party external provider through contract agreements.\r\n\r\nRecently, Geoscience Australia has been developing a Wetland Insight Tool (WIT) to allow users to observe the spatiotemporal behaviour of wetlands in Australia.  The outcomes generated by this tool provide an insight into wetland habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Basin Plan Evaluation 2020 products\r\nA range of products have been developed and released as part of the Basin Plan Evaluation 2020.\r\n\r\n[Link to content landing zone](https://www.mdba.gov.au/water-management/basin-plan/basin-plan-evaluations/2020-basin-plan-evaluation)\r\n\r\n[Link to reports and data page](https://www.mdba.gov.au/publications-and-data/publications/2020-basin-plan-evaluation-reports-and-data)\r\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in January 2011, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Leveque Shelf (survey number SOL5754/GA0340), a sub-basin of the Browse Basin, in May 2013. This survey provides seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the Browse sedimentary basin. The basin, located on the Northwest Shelf, Western Australia, was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially suitable for CO2 storage. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The principal aim of the Leveque Shelf marine survey was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Leveque Shelf area that may extend to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research, combined with deeper geological studies undertaken concurrently, addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit, i.e. the basal sedimentary section (Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous), and the regional integrity of the Jamieson Formation (the seal unit overlying the main reservoir). This dataset comprises total chlorin concentrations and chlorin indices from the upper 2cm of seabed sediments.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.",

    "description": "This dataset shows the attendance rates for all NSW government schools in Semester One by alphabetical order. \nData Notes:\n\n\n2021 data is not comparable to previous years due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to calculation rules to align with ACARA’s national standards (version 3) and changes to the way attendance data is transferred into the department’s centralised data warehouse. Please refer to 2021 Semester 1 student attendance factsheet for more information.\n\n\n2020 data is not provided because students were encouraged to learn from home for several weeks in Semester 1. Please refer to the factsheet on The effects of COVID-19 on attendance during Semester 1 2020 for more information.\n\n\nIn 2018 NSW government schools implemented the national standards for student attendance data reporting. This resulted in a fall in attendance rates for most schools due to the inclusion of part day absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation. Data from 2018 onwards is not comparable with earlier years.\n\n\nSchools for Specific Purposes (SSPs) are only included from 2021. Prior to this SSP attendance data was not collected centrally.\n\n\nThe attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student days attended by full-time students in Years 1–10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended in Semester 1. Figures are aligned with the National Report on Schooling and the My School website.\n\n\nData is suppressed \"sp\" for schools where student numbers are below the reporting threshold.\n\n\nData is not available \"na\" for senior secondary schools or other schools where no students were enrolled in Years 1-10.\n\n\nBlank cells indicate no students were enrolled at the school that census year or the school was out of scope for attendance reporting.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nEducation Statistics &amp; Measurement, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation\n",

It was created as part of an initiative to innovatively monitor coastal dune erosion and visualize these changes over time for future management and mitigation. This data includes Orthomosaic, DSM, DTM, Elevation Contours, 3D Mesh, 3D Point Cloud and LiDAR constructed from over 500 images captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh\nThis LiDAR dataset is a 3D point cloud (i.e. a 3D set of points in .LAS format): the X,Y,Z position and colour information is stored for each point of the point cloud of the Floreat pipeline and surrounding dunes (2022 Flight-3 project area).",

    "description": "This project aims to continue to perform rapid measurements of relativistic parameters of southern binary pulsar systems using data from the Parkes Ultra Wideband Low (UWL) receiver and the MeerKAT telescope thereby enabling measurement of their component masses and in some cases, test theories of gravity. We will use the UWL data to obtain significant orbital coverage and timing baseline on these pulsars and obtain important constraints on orbital and temporal DM variations that will help in identifying the nature of the companion star. We will then use MeerKAT data at crucial orbital phases to improve our chances of measuring the relativistic parameters. Increase in the number of measured NS masses has profound implications for NS internal structure and for stellar and binary evolution physics.",

The APS Employee Census has been conducted since 2012 and collects APS employee opinions and perspectives on a range of topics, including employee engagement, wellbeing, and leadership. \r\n\r\nThe APS Employee Census provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the APS Employee Census means these files are over 200MB in size. \r\n\r\nDownloading and opening these files may take some time.\r\n\r\n## Technical notes\r\nFive files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2025 APS Employee Census questionnaire: This contains the 2025 APS Employee Census questionnaire.\r\n* 2025 APS Employee Census data dictionary: This file contains a list of variables and labels within the APS Employee Census.\r\n* 2025 APS Employee Census - 5 point dataset with data values: This CSV file contains individual responses to the 2025 APS Employee Census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au.

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of areas subject to overland flow flooding inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. \n\nThe overall overland flow layer consists of the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (100 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) flood extent sourced from the Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path mapping study (GHD, 2017).\n\nHigh impact area:\n\nIn high impact areas, overland flow is almost certain to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 5% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings.\n\nMedium impact area:\n\nFor the majority of medium impact areas, overland flow is very likely to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 2% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings, however these hazards are experienced less frequently than in high impact areas.\n\nLow impact area:\n\nFor the majority of low impact areas, overland flow is likely to occur during a single lifetime (70 years). An event of this size or larger has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. The overland flow is generally safe for people, vehicles and buildings; however, certain areas can experience greater hazards.\n\nlink in the Data and resources section on this page.\n\nDue to a system issue, this data is not displayed here.

Measurements are taken using a geological compass. Surfaces are recorded as dip - dip direction. Lineations are recorded as plunge - azimuth. Declination measured to magnetic north then corrected to true north automatically within the database. A small amount of pre-1995 structural data has been digitised from previous maps.\nField data is either recorded in a notebook in the field then typed into the database or recorded digitally in the field and automatically transferred into the database (this applies to the majority of data collected since 2002).\nDisplay - structural measurements have been divided into four categories to simplify display. Bedding contains measurements of sedimentary bedding where the bedding surface is upright, overturned or younging unknown. Foliation contains measurements of the commonly measured foliations seen in rocks such as cleavages etc. Folds contains measurements of structures directly associated with folds such as fold axis, axial surface etc. Other contains all other structural measurements including faults, joints, quartz vein orientations etc.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months from May to December for 2001 and includes the total over the months. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",
