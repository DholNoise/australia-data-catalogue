    "description": "The Measuring Broadband Australia (MBA) program relies on households across Australia volunteering to receive a Whitebox that tests the performance of their fixed-line broadband services. Thousands of tests are run and these measurements are used to calculate average speeds achieved and other metrics for different volunteer groups, such as volunteers on the NBN fixed-line services and volunteers on NBN fixed wireless services. The summary data released includes test results for all Whiteboxes used in MBA Report 28 for download, upload, latency and outages metrics. The results are de-identified to protect the privacy of the volunteers and the integrity of the MBA program.",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2020)* is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia’s Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nAustralia’s National Forest Inventory has previously used the four derived category combinations of Dillon et al. (2015) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/IndigenousForestEstate_20150828_v1.0.0.pdf) for reporting the Indigenous estate in *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2013* and *Australia’s State of the Forests Report 2018*. These four categories combined in various ways the individual attributes of the Indigenous estate, with an area of land or forest being allocated to only one of the four categories. However, the categories did not allow separate reporting on Indigenous ownership, management or co-management, or other special rights.​\r\n\r\nThe methodology described in Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/publications/indigenous-estate-report) disentangles the four categories of Dillon et al. (2015), and allows separate reporting of each of Indigenous ownership of land or forest, Indigenous management or co‑management of land or forest, and land or forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have other special rights. Separate spatial coverages were created for each of these attributes, and this new dataset can form the basis for subsequent reporting on the relationships between Indigenous peoples and land or forest.\r\n\r\nThe methods and data in this data package use the same sources of data used for assembling the *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* spatial dataset, but presents the information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes ownership, management of co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology of Jacobsen et al. (2020). The Indigenous land dataset is also combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset.​ The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the *Australia's State of the Forests Report* Series. Further information can be found on the Forests Australia website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/sofr-2018",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents key results from a national survey of 1,585 recreational boat operators about their vessel biofouling management actions. The purpose was to inform a national communication approach to reducing the risk of marine pest translocation via biofouling of recreational boats in the Australian marine environment. \r\n\r\n Biofouling is a term for the growth on a boat's hull that can move invasive pests and diseases from one marine environment to another, which is a biosecurity risk. \r\n\r\n Australia's national approach to domestic marine pest biosecurity relies on voluntary uptake of the national biofouling management guidelines by recreational vessel operators, to prevent and manage biofouling growth. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The study found that a large proportion of recreational boat operators already undertake a range of effective biofouling management actions on a regular basis, with more than 60 per cent using best-practice approaches, such as regularly cleaning the boat hull and niche areas of the boat, renewing anti-fouling coatings each year and capturing biofouling waste after cleaning. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents demonstrated considerable interest in doing the right thing to protect the environment. The analysis presents opportunities to develop messaging that could be used as part of future engagement strategies with recreational boaters to influence behaviour voluntarily and promote best practice biofouling management activities.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for grain producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Grain producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that grew at least 40 hectares of grain, oilseed or pulse crops. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n The AAGIS is funded by The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC), Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. \r\n\r\n This report was commissioned and funded by the GRDC. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income for grain producing farms is estimated to have increased by 7 per cent in 2014-15 to an average of $229 000 a farm as higher total cash receipts more than offset a small rise in total cash costs. The average rate of return was 2.8 per cent. In 2015-16 average farm cash income is estimated to have increased further to around $258 000 and the average rate of return to have increased to around 3.5 per cent. \r\n• Specialist grain farms (grain farms that obtained more than 50 per cent of their total receipts from crops sales) recorded an average farm cash income of $304 000 in 2014-15; for non-specialist farms it was about $124 000. On average, from 2000-01 to 2015-16, specialist farms recorded farm cash incomes around $125 000 higher than non-specialist farms. \r\n• The Western region recorded higher average farm incomes and rates of return than the Northern and Southern regions in 2014-15. The Western region is estimated to have again been the best performing region in 2015-16. \r\n• The cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth - at 1.8 per cent - of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity include new plant varieties, better water management and improvements in cropping equipment technology. \r\n",

    "description": "The _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights.\r\n\r\n_Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ presents information on the Indigenous land estate by the separate attributes of ownership, management or co-management, and other special rights, according to the new methodology described in the ABARES report _Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate: separate reporting of Indigenous ownership, management and other special rights_ (Jacobsen et al. 2020) (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/AusIndigLandForestEstate_v1.0.0.pdf). The Indigenous land dataset is then combined (intersected) with forest cover information from the _Forests of Australia (2023)_ dataset. The resulting output dataset provides information on the Indigenous estate for both land and forest.\r\n\r\nThe Indigenous estate land attributes are as follows:\r\n\r\n* __​Indigenous owned__: freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land or forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan\r\n* __Other special rights__: land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements, and legislated special cultural use provisions.​\r\n\r\nThe _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2024)_ dataset shows that a total of:\r\n\r\n* 154 million hectares of land in Australia (20%) is Indigenous owned, of which 24 million hectares is forest\r\n* 192 million hectares of land in Australia (25%) is under some form of Indigenous management, comprising 156 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 36 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed. Of this, 31 million hectares is forest, comprising 20.7 million hectares that is Indigenous managed and 10.6 million hectares that is Indigenous co-managed\r\n* 443 million hectares of land in Australia (58%) is subject to other special rights for Indigenous peoples and communities, of which 62 million hectares if forest.\r\n\r\nThese areas of land are not mutually exclusive: there is substantial overlap between Indigenous owned land, Indigenous managed or co-managed land, and land subject to other special rights. Spatial intersection of these attributes confirms the total area of land in the Indigenous estate in Australia as at 2023 was 536 million hectares (70%), and the total area of forest in the Indigenous estate as 70 million hectares, as reported in Indicator 6.4a Area of forest to which Indigenous people have use and rights that protect their special values and are recognised through formal and informal management regimes (available at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr/criterion-6/indicator-6.4a) of _Australia’s State of the Forests Report_ (available at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/sofr).",

    "title": "Australian fisheries economic indicators report 2015: financial and economic performance of the Northern Prawn Fishery",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents results of the 2015 Northern Prawn Fishery survey, comprising survey based estimates of financial and economic performance for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial years, as well as non-survey based estimates of economic performance for the fishery in the 2014-15 financial year. Other indicators presented in the report include the total factor productivity index, input costs and ouput prices and management costs. \r\n\r\n The Australian fisheries economic indicators report expands on and takes the place of the former Australian fisheries surveys report. The information and analysis contained in these reports are accessed by policy makers, managers, researchers and industry. Alongside the usual detailed information about the financial performance of the average vessel and the overall economic performance of the fishery, this report also provides analysis of additional economic indicators for the Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery. The construction of these indicators draw upon the data collected through the fisheries survey program. Together with the financial and economic performance information, these indicators help to form a comprehensive picture of the economic performance of the Northern Prawn Fishery over a number of years. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The report has found that profit at full equity, a profit indicator that assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, increased for the average boat in the fishery between 2012-13 and 2013-14, from $239 066 to $382 939. \r\n• Net economic returns (NER) for the fishery rose from $5.2 million in 2012-13 to $12.3 million in 2013-14. The increase in NER from 2012-13 to 2013-14 was primarily driven by faster growth in fishing income than in fishing costs. The growth in fishing income was driven by increased landings of tiger prawns and banana prawns offsetting slightly lower beach prices for each. \r\n• The report indicates that total factor productivity (TFP) improved from 2004-05 to 2013-14. A strong relationship is evident between TFP and landed banana prawn catch, which is in turn largely dependent on seasonal conditions. Improved productivity also reflects the targeting of maximum economic yield (MEY) in the tiger prawn component of the fishery from 2004-05, effort reduction targets by management and the structural adjustment package (completed 2006-07) removing excess capital in the industry. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n As part of a three year (2015-16 to 2017-18) joint project between Forest and Wood Products Australia (FWPA) and ABARES, ABARES developed quarterly sales volume forecasts for selected wood products from the FWPA Softwood Data series. This technical report documents the methods and assumption underlying ABARES forecasts. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The FWPA Softwood Data Series (FWPA 2016) was established in 2002 by Australia's major softwood sawmilling companies and provides monthly sales volumes for 44 detailed product categories. ABARES was tasked to estimate quarterly forecasts for four specific wood products; untreated structural pine less than 120mm, untreated structural pine greater than 120mm, termite treated structural pine and landscape wood products. These forecasts will be made available for members of the FWPA data dashboard. \r\n\r\n\r\n• The econometric models estimated in the report are not based on formal structural economic models of the relevant wood product markets. Instead, they are simple, statistically robust, predictive models that are based on historical relationships and patterns observed over the sample period. \r\n\r\n\r\n• In interpreting or using ABARES forecasts it should be noted, that the FWPA Softwood Data series do not include all producers in the industry and the number of participating producers is changing over time. As such, the series are not representative of national production or sales and the effects of new entrants in the data series has the potential to affect the validity of the estimated models. The models estimated in this study, and approaches used to generate forecasts, will be periodically reviewed by ABARES in order to improve the accuracy of forecasts over time. \r\n",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Australian Commonwealth fisheries are managed with the objective of maximising economic returns to the Australian community - an objective that may be served by increasing the efficiency of the fishing fleet. This paper presents a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. ABARES used boat-level data to explore the potential of the SFA approach to determine the efficiency of the fleet and find reasons for any inefficiencies. \r\n\r\n This preliminary work: • indicates significant inefficiency in the CTS fleet \r\n• provides some support for the hypothesis that a structural adjustment in 2006 resulted in less efficient boats leaving the fishery, which led to improved economic returns \r\n• shows that interannual effects, such as stock availability, management changes and technical change, play a large role in the estimated frontier and must be disentangled from each other in further work to provide more information for managers.\r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "Data layers provided by the LGA and the information within are only valid at the time of production. The habitat layer provided by the LGA may vary in spatial coverage of vegetation based on the date of production and the latest imagery used to determine current vegetation presence. \nPotential clearing of vegetation based on landuse zoning is only indicative as variable outcomes of vegetation clearance based on the landuse zoning can occur.\nKoala Corridor mapping is only indicative as koalas do not traverse the landscape in a linear direction, although they will seek favoured trees.\nKoala occupancy mapping is only indicative as records rely on recording koalas in the landscape, records are driven by human activity.\nNot all areas were assessed, only areas that have the potential to be developed and therefore the potential to impact koala habitat. \nThis research has been funded by the NSW Koala Research Plan under the NSW Koala Strategy.

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were already in very good condition at the end of winter. \r\n• Rainfall in September was well above average in most regions in the eastern states (including South Australia). This resulted in plentiful supplies of soil moisture being available to crops during the critical period for grain development. However, in some areas, particularly in New South Wales, the September rainfall resulted in flooding and waterlogged crops, which adversely affected grain development. \r\n• In Western Australia, spring rainfall was average to slightly below average--but timely--and aided grain development. However, severe frosts adversely affected grain development in some growing regions. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes with higher production forecast for every state. This represents a 14 per cent upward revision from the forecast ABARES published in the September 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n• For the major winter crops: wheat production is forecast to rise by 35 per cent to a record high of 32.6 million tonnes; barley production is forecast to rise by 24 per cent to a record high of 10.6 million tonnes; and canola production is forecast to rise by 22 per cent to 3.6 million tonnes, which would be the third-highest on record. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology indicated in its latest three-month rainfall outlook (December 2016 to February 2017), issued on 24 November 2016, that summer was likely to be drier and warmer than average. This should aid harvesting. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n• Australian cotton production is forecast to increase by 64 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.0 million tonnes of cotton lint and around 1.5 million tonnes of cottonseed. This forecast largely reflects increased planted area, which is estimated to have almost doubled to 520 000 hectares. \r\n• Area planted to grain sorghum is forecast to fall by 31 per cent in 2016-17 to 471 000 hectares, the lowest in 24 years. This reflects higher expected returns from growing cotton. Grain sorghum production is forecast to fall by 29 per cent to 1.4 million tonnes. \r\n• Area planted to rice is forecast to increase almost fourfold in 2016-17 to 90 000 hectares in response to an increase in the supply of irrigation water available to rice growers. However, area planted to rice is expected to be constrained by the later than usual winter crop harvest in southern New South Wales. Rice production is forecast to rise to 916 000 tonnes, an increase of more than three times on the previous season. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the first national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at September 2017. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). It complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 dataset (ABARES 2017). Agricultural commodities are assigned to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8 (ABARES 2016) classes based on; perceived intervention to the landscape, growing conditions and management, the intended use of the commodity, consistency with national and international reporting frameworks and standards, such as National Plantation Inventory, industry guidelines, Australian Bureau of Statistics, harmonised trade codes and ABARES commodity reports, where possible. \r\n\r\nCommodities data were produced as part of catchment scale land use mapping and primarily uses fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field (ABARES 2011, 2015). Field validation was critical for mapping commodities. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nJurisdictions captured commodity data (where possible) for those areas most recently mapped in the Catchment scale land use of Australia - Update September 2017 (ABARES 2017) with a focus on horticultural and intensive animal industries. Other commodities which are tertiary classes of the ALUM classification (such as sugar cane, cotton, rice, olives and grapes) have been mapped by jurisdictions for some time and are included in this dataset. Agricultural commodity level mapping is available for all of the Northern Territory, and is likely to be complete for the following commodities nationally: \r\n\r\n* Crops - rice, sugar cane, cotton\r\n* Fruit - bananas (except Southern Queensland), avocados, mangoes, olives, grapes\r\n* Nuts - macadamias\r\n* Livestock - dairy cattle, pigs, poultry, horse studs, aquaculture.\r\n\r\nCommodity information is selected from an agreed list of commodity names developed by ACLUMP partners. A commodity may be applied to one or many land use codes. For example the commodity 'wheat' is applied to class 3.3.1, 'Cropping' or 4.4.1, 'Irrigated cropping', while 'cattle' may be applied to any land use where cattle are observed including 2.1.0 'Grazing native vegetation', 3.2.0 'Grazing modified pastures', 4.2.0 'Grazing irrigated modified pastures', 5.2.2 'Feedlots' etc. \r\n\r\nThe commodity description is intended to add information to the catchment scale land use map which is not otherwise recorded in the ALUM Classification. Where there are several suitable commodity descriptions mappers are encouraged to record the most detailed description. For example when cattle breeds are known to be for milk production mappers would apply the commodity description 'cattle dairy' rather than just 'cattle'.\r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report examines Australian and international experience in monitoring farmgate and retail prices for food products. It also outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The food retail sector in Australia is highly concentrated while there is increasing consolidation in the food processing sector. There is some concern that this could lead to farmers receiving lower prices and consumers paying higher prices than would be the case in a perfectly competitive market. \r\n• The paper reviews local and international research in monitoring movements in farm and retail prices for food products, outlines a simple methodology to monitor farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products, and investigates the potential to apply the methodology to Australian data. \r\n• The review of international research found significant variation across countries in the importance they place on food price monitoring and analysis. Research has consistently found that the more processed food products are, the lower the farm share, and that farm shares have generally been declining over time. \r\n• The review also found that the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS) is a world leader in analysing prices in food supply chains. The paper outlines a relatively simple methodology used by the USDA ERS to monitor changes in farm shares and farm-to-retail price spreads for food products. \r\n• While there are limitations with the USDA ERS approach, an increase in farm-to-retail price spread or a decrease in farm share of the retail price could be a useful early indicator that competition issues are emerging within a supply chain. However, additional analysis will always be required to confirm whether the cause was an increase in market power because these changes can occur for a number of reasons, including differences in productivity in different sectors or input prices increasing at a faster rate in the retail sector than in the farm sector. Unfortunately, there is generally a lack of data that will allow a breakdown in marketing costs to facilitate this analysis. \r\n• One option for additional research is to replicate another methodology developed by the USDA ERS, which uses input-output data to decompose costs and profits between different sectors within a supply chain and to estimate returns to primary factors, including capital and labour. This type of analysis would be more expensive than the high-level analysis described in this paper but it would also be more informative than the farm share/price spread analysis in identifying the range of factors influencing prices, and lead to a more informed debate about the various factors influencing prices, including market power. \r\n",

    "description": "Since the peak of the Millennium drought, the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) has seen large increases in nut and cotton plantings, decreases in water supply due to environmental water recovery and tighter limits on water trade between regions. These changes have raised concerns about how the water market might cope under drought conditions. \r\n\r\n In this study, ABARES applies an economic model of the sMDB to simulate what would happen to the water market under a repeat of the Millennium drought, with current water demand, environmental water recovery, trade limits and carryover rules. These scenarios provide an indication of future water prices and trade patterns across the sMDB under a repeat of historical climate conditions (for the period 2002-03 to 2016-17). \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n• Modelling results suggest that under a repeat of historical conditions allocation water prices in the sMDB would rise no higher than the peaks observed during the previous drought. \r\n• Whilst demand for water has increased for cotton and almonds, this has been more than offset by reductions in demand in other industries particularly, grazing, dairy and rice. \r\n• Improvements in carryover rules will help to limit price rises under a repeat of the drought, with much larger volumes of water being stored between years. \r\n• Trade limits will likely be binding more often in the future, partly due to the changes in water demand. \r\n• While water price peaks are simulated to be no higher under a repeat of extreme drought conditions, they are higher on average, due in part to environmental water recovery. The modelling suggests a change in the distribution of prices, with fewer years of low prices.\r\n",

    "description": "####_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._####\r\n\r\n### Background ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information. \r\n\r\n### 2020 AIS data ###\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2020 AIS information lodged by multiple charities. \r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2020 AIS data. This report - the 8th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on [our website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/tools/reports/australian-charities-report-8th-edition).\r\n\r\n### Interpreting AIS data ###\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au).\r\n\r\n### Withheld information ###\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n### More ACNC data ###\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. \r\n",

    "description": "*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of national land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for application to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature conservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved tenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n This study examined the features of Australian wild dog management groups, particularly in terms of landholder participation and collaboration, to identify what helps or hinders the groups in achieving coordinated and effective wild dog management. The study was based on interviews with representatives from 30 groups across Australia. \r\n\r\n This work was undertaken as part of a broader ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n\r\n The study found that as well as reduced losses from wild dog attacks, the operations of many groups have resulted in more strategic and targeted control actions and better communication between neighbours. Wild dog management groups function as important social networks that help farming communities cope with the detrimental effects of wild dogs. The report makes suggestions about the support that groups may need in future to achieve wild dog management. \r\n\r\n The study findings have been used in the design of a national landholder survey on wild dog management, which ABARES conducted in late 2014.

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Tenure of Australia's forests (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\nTenure of Australia's forests (2013) v2.0 is a continental dataset of tenure classified into national forest tenure classes:  Multiple Use Public Forest, Nature Conservation Reserves, Other Crown Land, Leasehold, Private Freehold and Unresolved Tenure.  The dataset combines forest cover with land tenure information. \r\n\r\n The forest cover information was sourced from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0  dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset, reclassified in order to align the national forest types and national forest categories of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) forest cover dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013). \r\n\r\n The land tenure information was sourced from the commercially available Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) CADLite and Tenure datasets, and tenure data obtained from the former Forests NSW (now Forestry Corporation of NSW). The NFI - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments, whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests - used information from these sources to compile a national tenure dataset by applying a national classification to the data supplied by the states and territories to allow seamless integration. \r\n\r\n As with previous versions, this Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 dataset was produced by combining the NFI land tenure dataset with the most recent Forests of Australia dataset. The only difference between the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) and the Tenure of Australia's Forests (2013) v2.0 is that the latter has the updated national forest cover types and new national forest categories. The underlying land tenure data is the same in both versions of the 2013 forest tenure datasets. \r\n",

However, yields of dryland summer crops are expected to be constrained by hot and dry seasonal conditions during summer. \r\n• The Bureau of Meteorology's latest three-month rainfall outlook suggests above average rainfall is unlikely across the major summer cropping regions in Queensland and northern New South Wales. \r\n• Harvesting of 2016-17 winter crops is now largely complete and production is estimated to have exceeded the forecast of record production presented in the December 2016 edition of Australian crop report. \r\n",

    "description": "_Fires in Australia’s Forests 2016–21 (2024)_ is a continental spatial dataset of the extent and frequency of planned and unplanned fires occurring in forest in the five financial years between July 2016 and June 2021, assembled for _Australia's State of the Forests Report_ Indicator 3.1b Area of forest burnt by planned and unplanned fire. It was developed from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and territory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest Fire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest cover information sourced from the _Forests of Australia (2023)_ dataset (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/forest-cover), and forest tenure information sourced from the _Tenure of Australia’s Forests (2023)_ dataset.\r\n\r\nPlanned fire: Fire started in accordance with a fire management plan or planned burning program, such as fuel-reduction burning or prescribed burning.\r\n\r\nUnplanned fire: Fire started naturally (such as by lightning), accidentally, or deliberately (such as by arson), but not in accordance with planned fire management prescriptions. Also called bushfire or wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.​\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a financial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event occurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is recorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into two categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and advice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe _Fires in Australia’s forests 2016–21 (2024)_ dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's _National Forest Policy Statement_ and the _Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002_ (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting.​​",

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the former  Australian fisheries surveys report. The information and analysis contained in these reports are accessed by policy makers, managers, researchers and industry. Alongside the usual detailed information about the financial performance of the average vessel and the overall economic performance of the fishery, this report also provides analysis of additional economic indicators for the Commonwealth Torres Strait Prawn Fishery (TSPF). The construction of these indicators draw upon the data collected through the fisheries survey program. Together with the financial and economic performance information, these indicators help to form a comprehensive picture of the economic performance of the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery over a number of years. \r\n\r\n This report presents results of the 2013 Torres Strait Prawn Fishery survey, comprising survey based estimates of financial and economic performance for the 2010-11 and 2011-12 financial years, as well as non-survey based estimates of economic performance for the fishery in the 2012-13 financial year. Other indicators presented in the report include the productivity index, input costs and output prices and management costs. \r\n\r\n Financial performance  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - was negative for the average vessel in the fishery in 2010-11 and 2011-12, at -$89 491 and -$87 366 respectively. \r\n• The change in profit at full equity was primarily attributed to higher cash receipts, which in turn led to higher vessel cash income and higher profit at full equity. \r\n\r\n Economic performance  \r\n• The net economic returns (including management costs) remained negative at -$2.1 million in 2010-11 and -$2.7 million in 2011-12. \r\n• In 2012-13 preliminary net economic returns were estimated at -$2.3 million using non-survey based methods. \r\n• The negative net economic returns from the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery is mainly attributed to the high costs associated with operating in a remote fishery. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Established pests and weeds represent a high ongoing cost to Australian agriculture. The Australian Government has invested $50 million through the Australian Competitiveness White Paper to improve the way pest animals and weeds are managed and to increase the capacity of farmers to deal with these threats. This is through investment in projects that: develop new and improved control tools and technologies; improve land manager awareness and access to control tools and technologies; improve land manager knowledge of best practice pest animal and weed management; and increase land manager and community participation in pest animal and weed management activities. \r\n\r\n To enable the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to evaluate outcomes of this investment, baseline data is required to provide a national overview of the status and management of established pest animals and weeds. Currently, there is insufficient data available to establish the baseline. Therefore a national survey of agricultural land managers was undertaken to collect data on pest animal and weed status, impacts and management actions at the property and local area levels. \r\n\r\n This report presents the results of responses from 6470 agricultural land managers, representing broadacre, dairy, horticulture and other livestock industries across all natural resource management regions in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n Nearly 80 per cent of respondents were actively managing a pest animal, and 85 per cent were actively managing weeds on their property in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Shooting and ground baiting continue to be widely used tools for vertebrate pest management. Herbicide is used by 90 per cent of landholders in the management of weeds and reported as effective by the vast majority. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents reported that pest animal and weed control methods they were using were at least moderately effective. \r\n\r\n Agricultural businesses spend a significant amount on managing pest animals and weeds. An average of $19,620 was spent per agricultural business on undertaking pest animal and weed management activities. This include pest animal and weed management related expenditure on traps, baits, herbicides, pesticides/insecticides, fuel, fencing materials, and labour (including the cost of contractors) on the property in the last 12 months. \r\n• For those managing pest animals they spend an average of $7,023 per year (pest animals including feral, natives, insects and other pests (for example, parasites and mites)). \r\n• Agricultural businesses spend an average of $17,917 per year on weed management activities, this includes all activities undertaken as part of the businesses’ usual production cycle activities, for example spraying weeds before planting a crop. \r\n Pest animal and weed control activities took an average of 77 person days per agricultural business by owners/operators (including family members) and 39 person days by contractors, employees and other people (for example, volunteers) in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Nearly eight per cent of landholders were members of a pest animal or weed management group. The majority of the groups had developed a plan for coordinating management activities or collaborating with other stakeholders. \r\n\r\n A majority of land managers reported: new and improved control methods; access to information on control options and methods; more management activities by other land managers (private and public); and better access to biological controls as important actions that could improve pest animal and weed management.

The report focuses on the beef industries of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Australia. There are two objectives. The first is to assess the main drivers behind growth of beef exports from each country between 2000 and 2014. The second is to project the value of beef exports between 2014 and 2030 under scenarios reflecting hypothetical and actual changes to policies and operating environments. \r\n\r\n A bilateral trade decomposition model was designed to quantify the historical drivers of beef exports from Australia and its major competitors in South America, with the aim of drawing implications for projections of future bilateral trade flows. Projections are developed for the period from 2014 to 2030 that are indicative of the prospects for both regions to expand their exports under three policy scenarios. \r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2022 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2022 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2022 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide [withheld](https://www.acnc.gov.au/withhold) from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. \r\nWe have published explanatory notes to help you understand this dataset.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS.\r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the ACNC website.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.

    "description": "Horticulture farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated citrus, pome and stone fruit growing farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies, with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin accounts for about three-quarters of Australia's citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit production with a large percentage of these crops grown in the southern Basin. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash income for citrus farms increased to around $90 000 in 2013-14 and then declined to around $72 000 in 2014-15. Pome fruit and stone fruit growers achieved average farm cash incomes of around $108 000 and $75 000 in 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15 the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) was 0.4 per cent for citrus growers and 0.7 per cent for pome and stone fruit growers. \r\n\r\n An increasing proportion of citrus farms used drip/trickle systems and fewer farms used low-throw sprinklers. Other irrigation systems used by citrus growers included micro sprays, overhead sprinklers and flood/furrow irrigation. Low-throw sprinklers and drip/trickle irrigation were also the most commonly used systems on stone fruit farms. Pome fruit was irrigated using a range of systems, with the most popular systems being low-throw sprinklers, micro sprays and drip/trickle irrigation. \r\n\r\n Few citrus growers traded water from 2010-11 to 2012-13, but around 54 per cent were net sellers of water in 2013-14. Most pome and stone fruit growers were non-traders in all years except 2007-08 and 2013-14. ",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "This data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\r\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\r\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\r\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\r\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\r\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\r\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment Designated irrigation\r\nareas indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\r\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\r\nThe precise meaning of the term designated irrigation area varies from\r\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\r\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\r\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\r\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\r\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\r\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\r\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\r\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\r\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\r\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\r\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\r\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\r\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\r\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\r\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\r\nsource material is highly variable and completness of coverage is poor in\r\nsome regions.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\r\n__00211a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\nLineage: The data set was constructed in vector format by appending irrigation area boundary data sets supplied by various agencies. The component data sets are listed below. One of the component data sets which was supplied as separate tiles in ArcView shapefile format was assembled into a single shapefile data set in ArcView 3.1. All other processing was carried out in ARC/INFO 7.2.1 under SunOS using double precision coordinates. For all operations in which processing used a fuzzy tolerance, the value specified was 0.00001 degrees (about 1 m). The raster form of the data set was made from the vector form. 1) Ord River Scheme, Stage 1, irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by Agriculture WA in ArcView shapefile format.2) Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland. This data set was supplied by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows designated irrigation areas. The coordinate datum is not known with certainty and was assumed to be the Australian Geodetic Datum 1984.3) Northern Murray-Darling Basin irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows actual irrigation areas, based on interpretation of coarse scale imagery derived from Landsat TM images. The data set comprises 11 polygons. Of these, five have not been retained in the national data set because they largely coincide with the much higher resolution polygons of the Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. A sixth has not been retained because it proves to be almost entirely covered by a national park and a perennial lake. One of the polygons that was retained was edited to give precedence to a higher resolution polygon in the Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland data set which it partly overlies.4) Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. This data set was supplied by the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, in ArcView shapefile format, as 50 separate tiles. It shows actual irrigation areas and a variety of other land uses and land covers related to cotton growing. It is based on interpretation of aerial photography and satellite imagery with extensive field checking. Only the polygons showing irrigation areas were included in the national data set. The tiles were merged in ArcView using the merge function of the GeoProcessing Wizard. Further processing was undertaken in AR\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Cost of production - Australian beef cattle and sheep producers 2012-13 to 2014-15",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents and discusses cost of production estimates for beef cattle and sheep producers for the three years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The on-farm cost of beef production on a per kilogram live weight basis increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15, as producers increased farm expenditure in 2014-15 in response to the much higher prices received for beef cattle. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, producers pared back expenditure on beef inputs to a minimum in response to low beef cattle prices in an attempt to maintain operating margins (receipts per kilogram less costs of production). \r\n• The largest increase in production costs occurred in northern Australia, where many beef producers were also subject to dry seasonal conditions in 2013-14 and 2014-15. This resulted in increased expenditure on fodder and freight. Overall, the total cost of production increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15 by 33 cents per kilogram live weight in northern Australia and by 25 cents in southern Australia. \r\n• Total costs of production averaged over the three years ending 2014-15 were similar in southern and northern Australia, at 174 cents per kilogram live weight in southern Australia and 175 cents in northern Australia. Northern Australia includes Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley, Pilbara and Murchison-Gascoyne regions of Western Australia. All other regions are included in southern Australia. \r\n• Higher beef cattle prices in 2014-15 resulted in operating margins increasing relative to the very low margins recorded in 2013-14. However, expenditure on farm inputs increased, so operating margins were similar to those recorded in 2012-13. \r\n• The average on-farm cost of sheep production on a per kilogram live weight basis remained largely unchanged between 2012-13 and 2014-15. \r\n• The average cost of production for beef cattle and sheep producers for the period 2012-13 to 2014-15 decreased as production size increased, which indicates that significant economies of size exist in beef and sheep meat production. These economies of size would be an incentive to expand beef and sheep meat production to enhance profitability. \r\n• Economies of size for sheep producers appear to result mainly from larger sheep enterprises using farm capital and labour more efficiently. However, for beef producers, cash operating costs for larger herd size producers were lower than those for smaller producers and they used farm capital and labour more efficiently. \r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

The Department of Agriculture has invested in the application of satellite imagery to monitor ground cover for Australia. This is a collaborative partnership with CSIRO, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN), all states and the Northern Territory. This data update includes maps and charts of median bare soil, green and non-green vegetation for Australia from 2000 to 2014 by month, season and year. This information enables regular monitoring of ground cover to assess environmental targets, such as those for the National Landcare Program, relating to soil erosion and land management in Australia. \r\n\r\n The updated ground cover summary statistics and supporting metadata will also be available for download from the National Computational Infrastructure web page https://remote-sensing.nci.org.au/u39/public/html/modis/fractionalcover-metrics-abares/.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2050 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin.Areas of risk are based on groundwater levels and air photo\r\ninterpretation. The merged data, at a nominal scale of 1:250 000, show actual\r\nareas where dryland salinity or water-tables less than 2 metres have been\r\nmeasured. For the extent map, every delineated area is underpinned by either\r\nair photo data or by one or more groundwater bores. Therefore, the area at\r\nrisk is regarded as conservative due to limitations in the spatial coverage of\r\nair photo and bore data.  number of techniques to spatially extrapolate these\r\ndata to infer potential areas at risk were trialed but were considered\r\nscientifically or statistically inadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on\r\nareas at risk having groundwater levels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment\r\nbased on groundwater less than 5 m and rising was considered inappropriate.\r\nTotal areas affected with groundwater less than 5 m and rising have been\r\npresented, but only for improved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a03.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "Rice farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated rice growing farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies, with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focused on rice growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where almost all of Australia's rice is produced. \r\n\r\n After 100 per cent closing water allocations in 2012-13, there were falls in allocations in 2013-14 and particularly in 2014-15. Average farm cash incomes in 2014-15 fell by around 28 per cent to around $132 000. The average rate of return was 1.7 per cent, higher than the average for all survey years of 1.3 per cent. \r\n\r\n All rice growers used flood irrigation because of the need to apply large volumes of water to rice crops at high delivery rates. \r\n\r\n In most survey years, a majority of rice farms did not buy or sell irrigation water. Of those farms that did trade water, there were more sellers than buyers of water. On average, sellers of water recorded higher rates of return on capital than either buyers or those not trading water. ",

    "description": "ABARES has produced the 2016 update to the About My Region reports. Based on the regional boundaries set by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ASGS SA4 regions), each regional profile presents an overview of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors in the region and the recent financial performance of the broadacre and, where relevant, dairy and vegetable industries. These reports are being released for the first time online as a series of web pages. \r\n\r\nAbout My Region consists of the 56 profiles and a web site providing access. The web site contains a list of regions, organised by state that link to the profiles. The About My Region report series is already available on the ABARES website, however, for the first time the latest updates will be published as a set of web pages. All data used in the update of these profiles have previously been released by ABARES or ABS. \r\n\r\n The December 2016 issue updates one section of each profile, giving the most recent available data on the number and type of farms by industry classification, and the distribution of farms by estimated value of agricultural operations (EVAO). \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Overview Since 2007 ABARES has conducted an annual survey of vegetable growing farm businesses to provide industry and government with information about farm-level production and the financial situation of vegetable growers. This report contains results from the ABARES survey of vegetable growing farms conducted from March to June 2016, which collected data on the characteristics of vegetable farms in 2014-15 and 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• In 2015-16 average farm cash income of Australian vegetable-growing farms is estimated to have increased to around $249 000 per farm. Vegetable cash receipts increased as a result of higher vegetable production, mainly from an increase in crop yields. \r\n• The average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) of Australian vegetable-growing farms increased to 3.0 per cent in 2014-15 and 3.6 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n• In 2014-15 an estimated 12 per cent of vegetable-growing farms made additions to total capital. These consisted primarily of land purchases but also included plant, machinery and equipment. \r\n• The majority of debt held by Australian vegetable-growing farms is for working capital management and land purchases. Nationally, farm debt fell by 7 per cent during 2014-15 to an average of $454 200 (in 2015-16 dollars). \r\n",

Cite as: Sheng, Y, Jackson, T and Lawson, K ,2018, Evaluating the benefits from transport infrastructure in agriculture: a hedonic analysis of farmland prices. Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics. doi:10.1111/1467-8489.12243 \r\n\r\n Access to transport infrastructure generates a range of benefits to the agriculture sector; many of which are difficult to measure directly. In this study, we use hedonic regression analysis of farm-level data to examine the contribution of transport infrastructure to the value of farmland traded between 2009 and 2011 through its impact on farm productivity. \r\n\r\n We show that a one per cent of reduction in the cost of transportation between farms and ports leads to a 0.33 per cent increase in land prices, and there is no significant difference between rail and road transportation at the aggregate level. Moreover, the benefits generated by particular types of infrastructure services vary between industries and with farm size, suggesting there are multiple channels through which public infrastructure influences agricultural production. Our findings help to inform future investment decisions in Australia and in other countries by providing new evidence regarding the benefits of existing transport infrastructure. ",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n The productivity and cost of labour have considerable impacts on farm profitability, especially in the labour intensive horticulture industry. \r\n\r\n In this study, commissioned by the World Bank, we compared the labour productivity of seasonal workers employed under the Australian Government's Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) and working holiday makers, and the implications for farm profitability - using a survey, wages data and interviews with employers participating in the SWP. It builds on a previous ABARES study, by including analysis of the non-wage labour costs and factors that may influence growers' decision-making about labour choices. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n\r\n\r\n• The productivity of seasonal workers was higher than that of working holiday makers for the farm businesses in the study. Seasonal workers were 20 per cent more productive than working holiday makers for fruit picking tasks. Seasonal workers who returned to the farm had higher average productivity as they required minimal induction and training in subsequent seasons. \r\n• The non-wage labour cost related to seasonal workers was 2.3 times higher per hour worked than for working holiday makers, and was strongly influenced by requirements under the SWP such as recruitment, administration processes and training. However, the direct monetary benefits of hiring seasonal workers is likely to at least cover the higher non-wage labour costs and hence deliver a profitability gain. \r\n• This study found that in addition to the direct monetary benefits associated with different labour sources, growers recognised the reliability of seasonal workers as beneficial and a key risk management strategy during labour intensive harvest periods. Working holiday makers provide for greater labour flexibility at short notice. It was common for growers to employ seasonal workers and working holiday makers in a complementary fashion where seasonal workers formed the core of the workforce and working holiday makers were employed casually as needed. \r\n• The study suggests the relatively higher productivity and other benefits of accessing seasonal workers warrant further promotion of the SWP in the Australian horticulture industry. It also suggests that further streamlining the recruitment process and other SWP requirements for approved employers could increase the attractiveness for farmers to participate in the program. \r\n",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n Key issues  • Seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during winter were very favourable, and crops are generally in very good condition at the beginning of spring. \r\n• In parts of New South Wales and far southern Western Australia crops were waterlogged by very high winter rainfall, which is expected to constrain yields in these regions. \r\n• In its latest three-month rainfall outlook (September to November 2016), issued on 25 August 2016, the Bureau of Meteorology forecast spring rainfall to be around average in most cropping regions in Australia. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 16 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 46.1 million tonnes, driven by significant increases in forecast production in Western Australia and Victoria. \r\n• Wheat production is forecast to increase by 16 per cent in 2016-17 to 28.1 million tonnes, barley production by 11 per cent to 9.5 million tonnes and canola production by 23 per cent to around 3.6 million tonnes. Wheat and barley production are both forecast to be the second highest on record and canola production to be the third highest. \r\n• Total area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Planting conditions for dryland crops are expected to be favourable, and supplies of irrigation water for irrigated crops are expected to be higher than in 2015-16. \r\n• Forecast increases in area planted to rice and cotton in 2016-17 are expected to more than offset a forecast fall in area planted to grain sorghum. \r\n• Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 28 per cent to around 4.8 million tonnes. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n The report A stocktake of selected agricultural markets of the European Union: Opportunities for Australia compiles five articles on EU agricultural industries that were originally published in ABARES Agricultural Commodities quarterly reports between June 2016 and March 2017. These articles were on almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. The report examines EU domestic policies and markets, and trade opportunities for Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Since the mid 1990s the share of total Australian exports destined for the EU has been declining in favour of more lucrative and geographically closer Asian markets. \r\n• Part of the reason for the decline in the share of Australian exports to the EU has been caused by the regulation that supports the EU agricultural sector. EU agricultural imports are subject to restrictive quotas, in-quota tariffs and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• The Australian Government and the European Commission are working towards commencing negotiations for a free trade agreement. As the European Union is one of the largest consumers of agricultural goods in the world, a preferential agreement that improves access to the EU market may present opportunities for Australian agricultural exporters. \r\n• The commodities covered in this report are almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. These are high value or growing Australian agricultural industries. \r\n• The EU imports agricultural products from a large number of countries and has numerous existing trade arrangements with these countries. Australia therefore faces significant competition in the EU market for the five commodities. \r\n• The articles discuss the existing trade trends and EU policies for each of the five commodities. For beef, dairy and sugar it is posited that only a significant reduction in tariffs or enlargement of quotas would precipitate a strong diversion of Australian trade away from the geographically closer Asian markets to the European Union. This is because of weakening EU import demand given growing supplies of lower-priced, domestically produced product. \r\n• Australian exports of sheep meat to the European Union are constrained by a relatively small quota of 20,000 tonnes, which it has largely filled in each of the past 5 years. Australian exporters of sheep meat would benefit from improved access to that market given strengthening EU demand for sheep meat and relatively high prices. \r\n• EU imports of almonds are subject to a low tariff and import demand has been growing steadily. Removal of the tariff on Australian almonds would improve Australia's relative competitiveness but gains are expected to be modest over the medium term given the dominant foothold of the United States in the EU almond market. \r\n• The effect of Brexit on EU agricultural commodities markets and trade is uncertain at this stage. \r\n",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.

    "title": "Setting economic target reference points for multiple species in mixed fisheries",
    "description": "This publication was produced by CSIRO for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation with research and data support by ABARES.  \r\n\r\n The report develops a framework that can be used to assist managers to cost effectively develop target reference points that are consistent with the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy Policy for multispecies in mixed fisheries. The report addresses the problem of determining appropriate target reference points for target and by-product stocks in multispecies fisheries. The applicability of this framework is demonstrated using a case study fishery, the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. \r\n\r\n The report uses generic logistic and exponential bio-economic models to produce a target reference point consistent with the current management framework taking into consideration a wide range of biological and economic conditions. The output was included in the development of a generic decision support framework using two cost effective approaches: regression tree analysis and the Bayesian Network approach. Sensitivity tests were also conducted on all 4 models. The project also develops a separate set of bio-economic models specific to the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery examining the static and dynamic aspects of maximum economic yield. \r\n\r\n The results from the generic models suggest that the key determinants of the target reference point of individual species in multispecies mixed fisheries are catchability, growth rates and share of total fishery revenue. Other variables, such as costs of fishing, prices and number of species in the fishery are also influential but to a lesser degree. For the case study fishery, both of the cost effective approaches performed well and achieved better results than the current default proxy target reference point. An incidental result from the study is that attempting to impose a target reference point on all species may not be necessary (or feasible) in multispecies fisheries. Instead, imposing a target on the dominant species (in terms of revenue share) for each sub-fleet results in outcomes close to optimal, and reduces conflicts in catches where target reference points are not perfectly aligned.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Rapidly changing operating environments of government and their stakeholders threaten to outdate existing policy practices. Policymakers will need to adopt fresh ways of thinking, develop new skills and access innovative ideas. This will affect government policy making on issues affecting agriculture, fishing, forestry, water and rural communities more broadly. This report brings together a set of innovative ideas that collectively offer new thinking, new skills and new tools for policymakers both in the department and elsewhere. Innovation in policy and regulatory practice will help us continue to deliver outcomes for Australian agriculture and the community. The report reinforces the department's commitment to innovation as a core capability for the future. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The report comprises a wide range of findings resulting from a global scan of online and expert sources. The analysis reflects on issues - such as governance, risk and capability - that might affect the adoption of innovations within a government setting. \r\n\r\n Report findings are classified into three emergent themes that are interdependent in nature: \r\n• Thinking in new ways is critical to improving policy practice. Innovative thinking considers knowledge to be socially created, rather than a set of hard, incontestable facts. \r\n• New skills in contemporary and innovative practices can increase the range and depth of existing public sector capabilities \r\n• New tools for policymakers can improve the overall policy process and provide innovative policy instruments for specific policy problems. \r\n Innovation in government differs from private sector innovation, because these sectors vary considerably in their approach to risk, public accountability and managing success.

The report was commissioned by Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and expands on results that were published in  Agricultural Commodities (March quarter 2015)  and the  Australian farm survey results 2012-13 to 2014-15  report released in March 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Most farms producing lambs for slaughter are mixed enterprises, deriving receipts from cropping, beef cattle, sheep and wool and from the sale of slaughter lambs. \r\n• Farm cash income of specialist slaughter lamb producing farms, those farms most reliant on lamb production, is estimated to have increased from an average of $80 900 a farm in 2013-14 to $98 300 a farm in 2014-15. This increase was mainly a result of higher prices for lambs and sheep. \r\n• Farm cash incomes and business profit of all slaughter lamb producers are estimated to have fallen in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14. Reduced grain production in 2014-15 is estimated to have resulted in lower average total receipts of slaughter lamb producing farms despite an increase in sheep and lamb receipts mainly a result of increased prices. Average farm cash income of slaughter lamb producers is estimated to have declined by 8 per cent from an average of $180 100 a farm in 2013-14 to $166 000 a farm in 2014-15, in real terms. \r\n• Farm debt of slaughter lamb producing farms averaged $649 577 a farm in 2013-14, slightly more than that in 2012-13 ($641 400). Farm debt is estimated to have reduced in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 as a result of loan repayment and reductions in new borrowings. \r\n• Asset values and new investment remain high for slaughter lamb producing farms and while debt is also high, equity ratios and debt servicing are in line with long-term averages. \r\n",

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Forests of Australia (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\n*Forests of Australia (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, \r\n including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as \"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to\r\nstate and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2016), also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2016), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map\r\nas forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "This report examines three potential outlook scenarios for Australia's forestry sector using analysis of the potential availability and use of logs, forecasts of wood product consumption, and the opportunities for processing of wood products and investment. \r\n\r\n ABARES conducted a number of workshops with industry and government stakeholders to refine the scenarios and test the assumptions supporting this analysis. A business-as-usual scenario was analysed, which depicts a future assuming current economic, policy and environmental factors affecting the forestry sector remain unchanged over the projection period (to 2050). Two alternative scenarios (priority-to-productivity and constrained-wood-production) are also examined. Sensitivity testing was also conducted to identify the influence of key parameters. \r\n\r\n The analysis in this report highlights some key opportunities for Australia's forestry sector, as well as the economic and policy factors required for realising these opportunities. The results affirm that a positive investment environment for upgrading and expanding wood processing infrastructure will underpin growth in Australia's forestry sector. ",

    "description": "Paper presented at the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES) 2016 Conference. \r\n\r\n Achieving an efficient allocation of fishery resource stocks between commercial and recreational fishers is often hampered by incomplete information about the economic value of these fisheries to the community. Economic data for Australia's recreational fishing sector are currently not readily available in a form that can be used for resource allocation decisions. The little data that are available provide a limited picture of the economic value of the sector. This is largely due to the non-market nature of goods produced by recreational fishing. \r\n\r\n This paper provides a theoretical framework for how non-market values associated with recreational fishing can be derived using the travel cost method. It then combines this with economic information from the commercial sector to assess the effect of changes in allocation of a fish stock between recreational and commercial fishers. The framework assumes that the commercial and recreational catch is regulated via a total allowable catch. The paper also highlights some of the impediments of using this framework in applied analysis. The description of the travel cost method in a recreational fishing context is supported by a summary of some recent work undertaken by ABARES in valuing game fishing activities in eastern Australia. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Research, development and extension (RD&E) is central to the competitiveness of Australia's agriculture industry. Growth in investment pushed the value of RD&E funding in Australia to $3.3 billion in 2014-15. Funding for rural R&D increased from $2.6 billion ten years before, in real terms. This includes public and private investment related to primary production, sustainable resource use, agricultural inputs and the processing sector. \r\n\r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Public sector delivering the R&D building blocks  \r\n\r\n• The public sector remains the largest overall source of rural R&D funding. Public funding for rural R&D increased from $1.4 billion to $1.54 billion (in real terms). This growth was driven by growth in funding from the Australian Government and universities, which offset a decline in funding from the state and territory governments. The public sector plays an important role in funding R&D particularly longer-term fundamental research. \r\n\r\n Private sector funding boosting R&D investment  \r\n\r\n• The private sector funding grew strongly over the ten years examined and now plays a greater role in funding rural R&D. Total private R&D funding increased from $912 million in 2005-06 to $1.46 billion in 2014-15 in real terms. Greater private funding stemmed from private firms increasing investment in their own R&D, with slower growth in contributions to the rural Research and Development Corporations (RDCs). \r\n\r\n Based on recent trends in Australia and internationally, the private sector has the potential to play a greater role in Australian R&D investment. The private sector concentres on marketable technologies like those related to seeds or chemicals that are more likely to generate additional profits. However, growth in private sector investment is not guaranteed and will depend on both the expected return on R&D investment and the international competitiveness of our R&D providers. \r\n\r\n Extending the ideas  \r\n\r\n• Getting innovations out of the laboratory and in to the field and factory is also essential to lift producer efficiency. Total rural extension funding is estimated at $316 million in 2014-15. Just under half of this funding was provided by the private sector through farm advisors to boost farm profitability. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This publication summarises the forecasts presented in the December 2016 editions of ABARES Australian crop report and Agricultural commodities as well as material from an ABARES report on productivity in the Australian grains industry released in October 2016. \r\n\r\n This publication was commissioned by the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC). \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n\r\n World indicator prices of wheat and coarse grains are forecast to fall in 2016-17 as a result of expected plentiful supplies globally. In contrast, world oilseeds indicator prices are forecast to rise because of a fall in supplies in the early part of 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Favourable seasonal conditions in most cropping regions during spring boosted the production potential of crops, which were generally in very good condition at the end of winter. Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 32 per cent in 2016-17 to a record 52.4 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tTotal area planted to summer crops is forecast to rise by 15 per cent in 2016-17 to around 1.4 million hectares. Producers are expected to increase planted area in response to favourable levels of soil moisture early in the planting window and plentiful supplies of irrigation water. Total summer crop production is forecast to rise by 21 per cent in 2016-17 to around 4.6 million tonnes. \r\n\r\n\tThe cropping industry recorded the second highest total factor productivity growth--at 1.8 per cent--of all broadacre industries between 2000-01 and 2013-14. Key drivers of cropping industry productivity growth include larger machinery and cropping equipment, new plant varieties, better water management and a better understanding of harvesting and planting strategies.

    "description": "Analysing the economic potential of forestry for carbon sequestration under alternative carbon price paths  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n The introduction of a carbon price under the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) may be effective in promoting afforestation in Australia and contribute to Australia's emissions target through carbon sequestration. Rates of sequestration will depend on the stringency of the emissions reduction target, and hence the level of the carbon price. However, the rate of afforestation arising because of the carbon price may potentially affect the attractiveness of agricultural land use activities in Australia. In general, higher carbon prices are expected to decrease the profitability and attractiveness of other land use activities, such as agriculture, in favour of timber plantations and environmental plantings which generate carbon credits under the CPRS. \r\n\r\n ABARE has been commissioned by the Commonwealth Treasury to estimate the potential increase in afforestation activity on agricultural land under four hypothetical scenarios and a reference case. The key assumptions underlying ABARE estimates are described in some detail in this report. Assumptions relating to the cost of investment of afforestation and the area of land available for switching are important determinants of the land use conversion. Afforestation activity is assumed to include the establishment of commercial plantations and environmental plantings between 2007 and 2100. ",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ### \r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nAs at 15 December 2017, over 48,500 registered charities had submitted their 2016 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2016 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key issues  • There has been a generally favourable start to the 2016-17 winter crop season, especially in Western Australia. Seasonal conditions have been more varied in the eastern states but there was timely above average rainfall in late autumn and early winter in these states. \r\n• According to the latest three-month rainfall outlook (June to August 2016) issued by the Bureau of Meteorology on 26 May 2016, winter rainfall is likely to be above average in most cropping regions. \r\n• The total area planted to winter crops in Australia is forecast to increase by around 1 per cent in 2016-17 to 22.3 million hectares. The area planted to canola, oats and some pulses is forecast to increase. However, the area planted to wheat and barley is forecast to decline, reflecting more favourable expected returns from growing other crops. \r\n• Total winter crop production is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2016-17 to 42.3 million tonnes, which largely reflects a forecast increase in average yields. \r\n• Harvesting of 2015-16 summer crops is now largely complete. Total Australian summer crop production is estimated to have fallen by 13 per cent in 2015-16 to 3.7 million tonnes, largely because of a fall in rice production\r\n",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU beef industry, world biofuel policies and the South American wine industry. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 6.1 per cent to around $60.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 4.2 per cent increase to $56.7 billion in 2015-16. At this forecast level the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 16 per cent higher than the average of $52 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to decrease by 2.2 per cent to $28.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 14.7 per cent to $31.7 billion in 2016-17. This reflects forecast increases in the gross value of horticulture and cotton production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to increase by 6.7 per cent to $47.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.4 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.6 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2016-17 are wheat (up 25 per cent), wool (3 per cent), sugar (23 per cent), wine (3 per cent), barley (15 per cent), cotton (56 per cent), chickpeas (74 per cent), lamb (4 per cent), canola (33 per cent) and rock lobster (6 per cent). \r\n• The forecast increases in export earnings are expected to be partly offset by forecast falls in beef and veal (down 17 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (17 per cent) and mutton (12 per cent). Export earnings for dairy products are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 3.4 per cent to $1.6 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7.1 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US75 cents in 2016-17, slightly higher than the average of US73 cents in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU beef industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers and importers of beef. Access to the EU market is controlled by strict animal health requirements and various quotas, which limit the amount of beef that can be imported. \r\n• As the European Union is a high value market for beef, improved access for Australia from a free trade agreement would likely lead to increased exports to this market. \r\n\r\n Oils ain't oils  \r\n• Biofuel policies in some of the world's largest biofuel producing economies have the potential to affect returns to Australian agricultural exports such as canola, sugar and coarse grains. \r\n• This article looks at recent developments in the world's leading biofuel producers and consumers (the United States, European Union and Brazil) and discusses the expected impact on world commodity prices in 2016-17 and the high-level implications for agricultural commodities in the medium term. \r\n South American wine industry  \r\n• South America is a major world producer and exporter of wine, accounting for almost 14 per cent of world production. Wine exports from South America have increased markedly in the past 15 years and its wine increasingly competes in Australia's major and emerging export markets. \r\n• This article focuses on the development of the Argentine and Chilean wine industries, with a focus on their competitiveness with Australian wine exports. \r\n",

    "title": "ACNC 2015 Annual Information Statement Data",
    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2015 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for a charity’s 2015 reporting year. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2014 – 30 June 2015, for others it will be the 2015 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2015 reporting period. \r\n\r\nSome charities report to the ACNC as part of a reporting group. The 2015 AIS information for these charities is attached as a separate dataset on this page. Any analysis of AIS data should include those charities as well.  \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS collects information about charity finances. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a network of researchers who are interested in the sector, and hold regular teleconferences. If you are interested in becoming involved in the Research network, please [email us](research@acnc.gov.au). The ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

These datasets replace the previous 2020 December updates. \r\nVersion 2 fixes issues caused during the conversion of the state vector datasets to rasters, where single pixel horizontal lines were generated in local areas. This does not affect the date or scale of mapping.\r\n\r\nThese data were compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs and other authoritative sources through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). These datasets are not recommended for change analysis or for national land use statistics—instead use the Land use of Australia 2010-11 to 2015-16.\r\n\r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n\r\nA seamless raster dataset that combines land use vector data for all state and territory jurisdictions, at a spatial resolution of 50 by 50 metres.\r\nShows a single dominant land use for each location, based on the management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies).\r\nUpdates have been made to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, the capital city of Adelaide, parts of the Great Barrier Reef NRM regions, and national updates to select horticultural tree crops and protected cropping structures. There are also minor corrections to Western Australia, and more accurate representation of mining areas in South Australia.  \r\nThe date of mapping (2008 to 2023) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary and are provided as supporting datasets. \r\nProduced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. \r\nRefer to the metadata and ABARES website for additional information.\r\n \r\nAbout the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023 spatial dataset:\r\n- Provides location, extent and year verified for 185 commodities, where mapped, as a vector dataset. \r\n- Commodity data are validated in the field and using other sources.\r\n- Generally, a single commodity is shown at a location reflecting the most recent date that location was verified.\r\n- The location of a commodity may change on a seasonal to annual basis, depending on factors such as climate, markets or farming systems.\r\n- Not nationally complete or comprehensive, and with various dates of capture (1967 to 2023) and input mapping products (2014 to 2023). \r\n- Refer to the metadata for additional information.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n- Land use: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 version 2, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, June, CC BY 4.0, DOI: 10.25814/2w2p-ph98\r\n- Commodities: ABARES 2024, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2023, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "Report produced in collaboration between Universities and Commonwealth and State Government agencies.  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  provide national assessments of the status of key wild-capture fish stocks. The reports provide scientifically based stock status assessments for 68 key species (or species complexes), which cumulatively contribute over 90 percent of the value and 85 percent of the volume from Australian fisheries. \r\n• Stock status assessments in the 2014 reports are based on the abundance and level of harvest in 2013. In total, 238 stocks were assessed across the 68 key species; 129 stocks were classified as sustainable, these contribute around 87.5 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. There were 7 stocks classified as transitional-recovering, 19 as transitional-depleting, 11 as overfished and 4 as environmentally limited. There were 68 stocks where status was classified as undefined; these stocks contribute 6.4 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  focus on the status of targeted fish stocks. The status classifications do not consider broader ecosystem impacts of fishing, such as bycatch or habitat impacts, or social and economic considerations. These elements may be included in future editions, or companion reports. \r\n• The reports rely on a consistent national reporting framework that was developed collaboratively by fisheries scientists from around Australia. The framework provides transparency and consistency in stock status reporting across jurisdictions. \r\n• The Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  builds on the 2012 inaugural edition with 19 new species. Four of the new species are caught in Commonwealth fisheries. The additional species were nominated by the states and the Northern Territory as either iconic species that are likely to be seen in retail outlets or historically overfished species. \r\n• There were minor alterations to the national stock status classification framework and species chapters. The main update to the framework is the inclusion of the new environmentally limited stock category. The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  Advisory Group included this additional category to describe stocks depleted below the limit reference point by environmental factors rather than fishing. \r\n• Between 2012 and 2014 there have been a number of changes to stock structure and stock status for some species. In both cases the changes are based on the most recent and reliable information available. \r\n• The reports were developed collaboratively by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) and government fishery research agencies from all states, the Northern Territory and the CSIRO; more than 100 fisheries researchers were involved. \r\n",

    "description": "The Australian water markets report 2014-15 presents detailed information on water markets for the 2014-15 financial year, including statistics on water access entitlement and water allocation trade, market performance (trade processing times), entitlements on issue and environmental water. These statistics are presented nationally, for the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), and by state for systems outside the sMDB. \r\n\r\n Accompanying the report is a database of water trades from 2007-08 to 2014-15, and a spreadsheet containing the data underlying all report figures and commonly requested statistics. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n\r\n In 2014-15, Australian water access entitlement trade and water allocation trade totalled 1796 GL and 5784 GL respectively. For water access entitlement trade, this was a decrease of 614 GL or 34 per cent compared to 2013-14, largely reflecting a decrease in Commonwealth environmental water recovery. For water allocation trade, this was an increase of 243 GL or 4 per cent compared to 2013-14. The Murray-Darling Basin accounted for 81 per cent of national water access entitlement trade and 94 per cent of national water allocation trade, after excluding 2172 GL of environmental transfers in the sMDB. \r\n\r\n The 2014-15 water year was characterised by below-average rainfall, runoff and streamflow in Australia. Storage volumes declined significantly, from 70 per cent to 59 per cent nationally. This continued a trend of declining storage volumes since the flood events of 2011 and 2012. The poor seasonal conditions resulted in water allocation percentages in major water markets being generally lower in 2014-15 than in 2013-14, driving increases in water allocation and entitlement prices in most water systems. \r\n\r\n Historically, there have been few constraints on trade between regions and trading zones within the major sMDB market, leading to fairly consistent water prices between regions. However, in recent seasons, trade restrictions have become more important, with changes in trade flows, the introduction of new limits and the reintroduction of previously suspended limits. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15, just 52 GL of water was recovered by the Commonwealth, predominantly through infrastructure. Around 5 GL of entitlements were purchased in 2014-15, mainly from the northern MDB. ",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.

    "description": "The Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update 2020 dataset is the national compilation of catchment scale land use data available for Australia (CLUM), as at December 2020. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2018. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. The CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management Classification version 8. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program. Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2008 to 2019) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. Date and scale of mapping are provided in a supporting dataset.\r\n\r\n#What’s new?#\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the December 2018 version: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nThe following areas include some reclassification; the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory, rural residential areas in New South Wales.\t\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. \r\n\r\n#Citation#\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n The report presents results and analysis from a national survey of Australian sheep and cattle landholders in late 2014, in areas affected by wild dogs. The results are combined with data from a similar 2010 survey to assess longitudinal changes in wild dog impacts and management activities. \r\n\r\n Topics cover landholders' perspectives on wild dog problem severity and distribution, personal and economic impacts and collective management actions. The study also quantifies factors that influence the effectiveness of wild dog management groups and their achievement of outcomes. Around 1010 landholders participated in the 2014 survey. \r\n\r\n This study is the final phase in an ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n",

    "description": "Irrigated agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin: an economic survey of irrigators 2012-13 to 2014-15 presents key farm performance measures for irrigated horticulture, dairy, cotton and rice farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n The first three survey years (2006-07 to 2009-10) were severely affected by drought, with record low inflows to river systems and low irrigation water allocations. Incomes of horticulture, dairy, rice and cotton farms were relatively low throughout this period. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash incomes from 2010-11 onwards were mostly higher than in the first three survey years as seasonal conditions improved and water allocations increased. \r\n\r\n Water trading was an important tool for irrigators to manage low water allocations during severe drought, particularly between 2006-07 and 2008-09. The survey results show the proportion of farms trading water allocations rose from 2006-07 to 2008-09, then declined until 2010-11 as water supplies became more plentiful after the drought ended. ",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2017 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the long running ABARES  Australian fisheries surveys report. The report presents results from ABARES' fishery surveys on financial returns to fishers and net economic returns from fisheries to the Australian community. The report includes a range of other economic indicators, including productivity analysis. \r\n\r\nThis report covers the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS), and the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector (GHTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with new results for financial years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - has decreased since 2008-09, from $267 000 to $205 000 in 2012-13. In the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector, it has fallen from $200 000 in 2008-09 to $15 000 in 2012-13. This indicator assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, and includes income from all sources. \r\n• Net economic return in the Commonwealth Trawl Sector has declined from $7.3 million in 2010-11 to an estimated $1.4 million in 2013-14. Net economic returns in the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector has declined from $7.2 million to an estimated -$4.4 million in 2013-14. \r\n• The decline in net economic returns in both sectors may suggest that the total allowable catch settings may be misaligned with the Harvest Strategy Policy target of achieving maximum economic yield from the fishery. \r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nThis data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment.aDesignated irrigation\nareasa indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\nThe precise meaning of the term adesignated irrigation areaa varies from\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\nsource material is highly variable and completedness of coverage is poor in\nsome regions.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\n__00211a01.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof forest and non-forest land over which Indigenous peoples and\r\ncommunities have ownership, management, or rights of use, assembled\r\nfor *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from\r\nmultiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets\r\nrelated to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous\r\nland dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the\r\nForests of Australia (2018) dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies Indigenous land into four categories:\r\n*Indigenous owned and managed: freehold land that is both owned\r\nand managed by Indigenous communities\r\n*Indigenous managed: land that is managed, but not owned, by\r\nIndigenous communities; and lands that are owned by Indigenous\r\npeople but have formal shared management agreements with\r\nAustralia and state and territory government agencies\r\n*Indigenous co-managed: land that is owned and managed by other\r\nparties, but has a formal, legally binding agreement in place that\r\nincludes input from Indigenous people in the process of\r\ndeveloping and implementing a management plan\r\n*Other Special rights: land subject to native title determination,\r\nregistered Indigenous land use agreement, and legislated special\r\ncultural use provision.\r\n\r\nThe *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "    \n\nDefinition: Mean annual dissolved concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil\nwater (mg of nitrogen per kg of water), averaged for both soil layers.\nInterpretation: The dissolved N concentration is calculated as the ratio of\nthe mineral N store to soil water store, which assumes that all the mineral N\nis in solution. Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these\nstores, but not on their ratio. The pattern of mineral N concentrations is\nexplained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N\nstore (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air\ndryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy\nlimitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that\ndecreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-\narid tropical environments. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes (1) current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation; (2) current agricultural inputs of nutrients\n(nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertiliser, legume crops, and legume pastures;\n(3) current nutrient offtakes by product removal (harvest, stock).\nNMnlConc0.Agric a Mean annual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water\n(mgN kgH2O-1) in the aAgrica (present day) scenario NMnlConc0.Base a Mean\nannual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water (mgN kgH2O-1) in the\naBasea (pre-1788) scenario Data is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_cmnswr9cl\n__02811a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Australian lamb: Financial performance of lamb producers, 2013-14 to 2015-16 - Research report 16.9",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for lamb producers for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Lamb producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that sold, on average, 200 or more lambs for slaughter a year over the three years ending 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Farm cash income of lamb producing farms rose on average over the period 2013-14 to 2014-15. The majority of the rise in farm incomes came from higher beef and lamb receipts due to increased prices and sales for both commodities. Average farm cash income of lamb producing farms is estimated to have increased further in 2015-16 mainly as a result of increased crop, wool and beef cattle sales. \r\n• Average incomes of lamb producing farms are estimated to have risen from 2014-15 to 2015-16 in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The majority of the increase in farm incomes in these states was from higher cropping receipts. \r\n• In real terms, the estimated average farm incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 were among the highest recorded since 2001-02. \r\n• Rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for lamb producers fell marginally from 2.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 2.5 per cent in 2014-15. The average rate of return is estimated to have increased in 2015-16 to around 3.0 per cent, reflecting higher incomes. \r\n• Average debt for lamb producers increased in real terms by around 88 per cent from $323 000 in 2000-01 (in 2015-16 dollars) to an estimated $605 000 in 2015-16. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of increases in average farm size and borrowing for land purchase, as well as for ongoing working capital. \r\n• Overall, changes in average debt over time have been modest relative to lamb producers' capacity to service debt by generating income. On average, around 8 per cent of lamb producers' farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments over the 10 years to 2015-16. In 2015-16 an estimated 6 per cent of farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments. \r\n",

    "title": "Potential displacement of commercial fisheries by a Commonwealth marine reserve zoning scheme",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The Government commissioned an independent review of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves that were originally proclaimed in November 2012. The Department of the Environment commissioned ABARES to assess potential displacement of commercial fishing by alternative marine reserve designs and zoning options considered by the Bioregional Advisory Panel. The report details potential displacement by the network proclaimed in 2012 and the network recommended by the Panel in 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  • The potential impact of the Panel recommended (2015) zoning on commercial fisheries in the regions is relatively small, compared with the total gross value of production (GVP) from all wild capture fisheries. However, while much of the total impact is diffuse, some of the potential impact is concentrated in particular fisheries, entitlement holders and towns. \r\n• The Panel recommended (2015) zoning would potentially displace an estimated annual average 587.6 t of catch, with an annual average GVP of $4.51 million. This is less than the proclaimed network (2012), which would displace 1032 t of catch, with a GVP of $8.21 million. \r\n• For individual entitlements, there are a large number for which the potential impacts of the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning are relatively low (more than 700 entitlements with less than $2500 displaced per year) and a small number of entitlements for which the potential impacts are higher (17 entitlements over $50 000). The largest displacement from one entitlement was $164 000. These figures do not include South Australian entitlements because ABARES did not receive fisheries data at this scale for South Australian fisheries. A single business unit may hold multiple entitlements and so the impact on a business unit would be the sum of the individual entitlement impacts. \r\n• At the fishery level, the largest GVP displacements from the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning would be from the Western Australian West Coast Rock Lobster Fishery ($823 000), Commonwealth Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery ($585 800) and Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery ($488 200). \r\n• In terms of the proportion of GVP from the entire fishery, the largest displacements would be from the Commonwealth Coral Sea Fishery (71.2 per cent of fishery GVP), Western Australian North Coast Shark Fishery (33.9 per cent) and the Western Australian South West Trawl Fishery (13.2 per cent). \r\n• Towns with the highest potential GVP displacement were Mooloolaba in Queensland ($515 100), Geraldton in Western Australia ($449 200) and Fremantle in Western Australia ($406 300). \r\n• The estimated net economic impact of the Panel-recommended network would be reduced regional economic activity of $7.9 million in the short term. Potential short term employment impacts were separately estimated at 18 total jobs (estimate derived from previous economic modelling) and 49 jobs (estimate derived from previous surveys of fishers). Changes in economic activity at the state / territory level are expected to be negligible in terms of the size of the economies. These estimates have been made by rescaling previous economic modelling and survey results (from 2012); ABARES was not commissioned to undertake new economic modelling or surveys. \r\n\r\n Note: This document is hosted on the Department of Environment website.

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Leadbeater's possum  Gymnobelideus leadbeateri  is a listed threatened species found mainly in montane ash and snowgum forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, with a small occurrence in swamp forests in Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Threats to the species include wildfire, loss of hollow-bearing trees, and the harvesting of native forests. As a consequence, the species is a focus of sustainable forest management. \r\n\r\n The species was nominated for re-listing as Critically Endangered under the  Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  (EPBC Act) in 2013, from its previous category of endangered, with comments on the nomination requested by January 2014. Its listing category was raised from Endangered to Critically Endangered in May 2015, based on the recommendation of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. An updated Draft Recovery Plan for the species was then prepared with input from stakeholders. \r\n\r\n Over the period from 2013 to 2017, ABARES prepared briefing notes regarding the listing, conservation, recovery and management of Leadbeater's possum and the related issue of fire and forest harvesting. This publication brings together a series of these briefing notes. \r\n\r\n The briefing notes are presented as written at the dates indicated, except that occasional minor or typographical errors have been corrected, URLs updated, intra- and inter-departmental references removed, and footnotes now include clarifying amendments. The briefing notes are individually paginated. ",

    "description": "    \n\nCalculated annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) potential evaporation (mm) for the\nperiod 1980-1999. Calculated by the Priestley-Taylor method. Interpretation:\nPotential evaporation is an expression of the amount of water that it should\nbe possible to evaporate from an open water surface given the prevailing solar\nradiation, air temperature, and air dryness conditions. Potential evaporation\nis generally high over the Australian continent, significantly exceeding\nrainfall in all but the wettest areas. It is extreme (approaching 10mm/day) in\nthe northern inland in summer. It decreases with decreasing solar radiation,\nthat is with increasing southern latitude and in winter. Potential evaporation\nalso decreases with proximity to coasts, because of increasing cloudiness.\nActual evaporation is controlled by the various resistances to moisture loss\noffered by plants and soil. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation.EvapPT.00, EvapPT.01 a| EvapPT.12 a Mean\nannual and monthly potential evaporation (mm)Data is in albers equal area, and\nunprojected using GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ampe_r9cl\n__01512a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the current *Forest's of Australia (2023)* dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data.**\r\n\r\nForests of Australia (2013) v2.0 is a continental dataset of forest extent by national forest categories and types. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. \r\n\r\n A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\n The dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 presents the new NFI classification with three national forest categories, as reported by the NFI in  Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013  (SOFR 2013), and replaces the spatial dataset titled Forests of Australia (2013). The three national forest categories are: Native forest, Industrial plantations and Other forests. The 'Native forest' category has previously been reported by the NFI, however, 'Industrial plantations' and 'Other forests' are new categories for planted forests: 'Industrial plantations', for plantations managed commercially and reported through the National Plantation Inventory (NPI), and 'Other forest' for planted forest not managed commercially or otherwise not reported through the NPI. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's  National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS)  and the  Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) Act 2002.  The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

It was\r\ndeveloped from multiple fire area datasets contributed by state and\r\nterritory government agencies, after consultation with Australia’s Forest\r\nFire Management Group. The fire dataset is then combined with forest\r\ncover information sourced from the *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018, \r\nand forest tenure information sourced from the *Tenure of Australia’s\r\nForests (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nForest areas burnt by fire are allocated by the month of the fire to a\r\nfinancial year (July–June inclusive). Where more than one fire event\r\noccurs on any one hectare during a financial year, only the first fire is\r\nrecorded for that area in the financial year. Fires are also classified into\r\ntwo categories, planned and unplanned, based on the fire seasonality and\r\nadvice from state and territory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe *Fires in Australia’s forests 2011–16 (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is provided as part of the five-yearly Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n The March edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities to 2021-22. \r\n The outlook will be an important focal point at the conference and underpin many presentations delivered by ABARES speakers at the conference. \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts, as well as articles on the EU sheep meat industry; farm performance of broadacre and dairy farms; productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries; and disaggregating farm performance by size. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8.3 per cent to a record $63.8 billion in 2016-17 before easing by 3.9 per cent to a forecast $61.3 billion in 2017-18. Despite the forecast decline, the gross value of farm production in 2017-18 would be 17.3 per cent higher than the average of $52.3 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 4.4 per cent to $31.2 billion in 2017-18, following a forecast decrease of 2.6 per cent in 2016-17. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of livestock production in 2017-18 would be around 28 per cent higher than the average of $24.4 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to decrease by 11.3 per cent to $30 billion in 2017-18, after a forecast increase of 20.2 per cent in 2016-17. The decrease follows record production of wheat and barley in 2016-17, which resulted from favourable seasonal conditions during winter and spring. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of crop production in 2017-18 would be around 8 per cent higher than the average of $27.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• In 2021-22 the gross value of farm production is projected to be around $59.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8.6 per cent higher than the average of $54.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 (also in 2016-17 dollars). In 2021-22 the gross value of crop production is projected to be around $29.0 billion and the gross value of livestock production is projected to be around $30.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars). \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $48.7 billion in 2017-18, higher than the forecast $47.7 billion in 2016-17. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2017-18 are beef and veal (up 1 per cent), wool (10 per cent), dairy products (11 per cent), sugar (10 per cent), cotton (35 per cent), wine (5 per cent), lamb (3 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (4 per cent), rock lobster (6 per cent) and mutton (1 per cent). \r\n• Forecast increases in 2017-18 are expected to be partly offset by expected declines in export earnings for wheat (down 9 per cent), coarse grains (11 per cent), canola (6 per cent) and chickpeas (42 per cent). \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of wool, dairy products, sugar, wine, lamb, barley, canola, rock lobster and mutton are forecast to increase in 2017-18. Export prices for cotton and chickpeas are forecast to fall. Prices for beef and veal, wheat and live feeder/slaughter cattle are forecast to remain around the same as in 2016-17. \r\n• In 2021-22 the value of farm exports is projected to be around $46.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8 per cent higher than the average of $43.1 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• The value of crop exports is projected to be $24.9 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 7 per cent higher than the average of $23.2 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. The value of livestock exports is projected to be $21.8 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 10 per cent higher than the average of $19.8 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 2.3 per cent in 2017-18 to $1.5 billion, after decreasing by a forecast 3.4 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 3.3 per cent in 2017 and 3.4 per cent in 2018. Growth is expected to rise further to around 3.5 per cent in 2019 before declining to 3.4 per cent in 2021 and 3.3 per cent in 2022. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.8 per cent in 2017-18. Over the medium term to 2021-22, economic growth is assumed to average around 3 per cent. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2017-18, slightly lower than the forecast average of US75 cents in 2016-17. It is assumed to appreciate slightly over the medium term, reaching US74 cents towards 2021-22. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n The EU sheep meat industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers of sheep meat. Imports are controlled by import quotas and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. \r\n• Australia is the second largest exporter to the European Union, behind New Zealand, although its allocated quota is just 8 per cent that of New Zealand's. \r\n• As a high value market for sheep meat, expanding sheep meat exports to the European Union would benefit the Australian industry. However, until the trade outcomes of Brexit are known, opportunities for Australian sheep meat exporters are uncertain. \r\n\r\n Farm performance: broadacre and dairy farms, 2014-15 to 2016-17  \r\n• In 2016-17 farm cash income for Australian broadacre farms is projected to average $216,000 a farm, the highest recorded in the past 20 years. \r\n• Record broadacre farm cash incomes this year are the result of near record winter grain production in most regions and good prices for beef cattle, sheep, lamb and wool. \r\n• Average farm cash income is projected to increase for broadacre farms in all states except Tasmania in 2016-17. \r\n• Farm cash income for dairy farms is projected to decline by 17 per cent nationally to an average of $105,000 a farm in 2016-17, reflecting lower average farmgate milk prices and reduced milk production. \r\n\r\n Productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries  \r\n• From 1977-78 to 2014-15, productivity in the broadacre industries averaged 1.1 per cent a year as a result of declining input use (down 1 per cent a year) and modest output growth (up 0.1 per cent a year). \r\n• In the dairy industry, productivity growth averaged 1.5 per cent a year between 1978-79 and 2014-15. This reflected average annual growth of 1.3 per cent in output and an average annual decline of 0.2 per cent in input use. \r\n\r\n Disaggregating farm performance by size  \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms produced 46 per cent of total output, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms produced 12 per cent of total output. \r\n• The average rate of return, including capital appreciation, generated by the largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms was 8.2 per cent, while the smallest 10 per cent generated average returns of -2.8 per cent. \r\n• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms had the lowest average equity ratio of all farms (79 per cent), while the smallest 10 per cent of farms had the highest average equity ratio (97 per cent). \r\n",

    "title": "Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017",
    "description": "##This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at September 2017. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update May 2016 released in June 2016. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2003 to 2017) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the May 2016 version: Desert Channels and Mackay-Whitsundays natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland; the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges NRM region in South Australia (extending into part of the Murray-Darling Basin NRM region); the state of New South Wales; the state of Victoria; the state of Tasmania; the state of Western Australia; and the Northern Territory. The capital city of Adelaide was also updated using 2016 mesh block information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This equates to over 585 million hectares or 76% of Australia, the largest update of catchment scale land use mapping to date. \r\n\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. Users should also note that it is not possible to calculate land use change statistics between annual CLUM national compilations as not all regions are updated each year; land use mapping methodologies, precision, accuracy and source data (in particular satellite imagery) have improved over the years; and the land use classification has changed over time. In particular, the major differences between this September 2017 version and the May 2016 version are:\r\n\r\n* The September 2017 version has been mapped to version 8 of the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification (released in October 2016)\r\n* Improvements to the Western Australia mapping including improved mapping of native forests, conservation areas, topographic features, horticulture and intensive animal production\r\n* Changes to the mapping of native and modified pastures in New South Wales\r\n* Changes to the mapping of dairies in Tasmania so that only the dairy infrastructure is mapped as dairies and the dairy pastures are mapped as modified pastures.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to calculate change when earlier land use datasets have been revised and corrected to ensure that changes detected are real change and not an artefact of the mapping process. The Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) have done this on an NRM regions basis for Queensland and can be accessed at:\r\n\r\n* Data: Search the Queensland Spatial Catalogue (http://dds.information.qld.gov.au/dds/) for \"Land Use Mapping\"\r\n* Reports: https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/vegetation/mapping/qlump-reports.\r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). As a seamless spatial dataset for Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as irrigated horticulture and dryland cropping) and more specific land use categories such as grapes, cotton, cereals, sugar and tree fruits. These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Australia. A complementary dataset Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Commodities - September 2017 provides commodity level mapping as a vector dataset. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of catchment scale mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The date of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. The most current mapping occurs in intensive agricultural areas; older mapping generally occurs in the semi-arid and pastoral zones. \r\nThe primary classes of land use in the ALUM Classification are:\r\n \r\n1. Conservation and natural environments - land used primarily for conservation purposes, based on maintaining the essentially natural ecosystems present\r\n2. Production from relatively natural environments - land used mainly for primary production with limited change to the native vegetation\r\n3. Production from dryland agriculture and plantations - land used mainly for primary production based on dryland farming systems\r\n4. Production from irrigated agriculture and plantations - land used mostly for primary production based on irrigated farming\r\n5. Intensive uses - land subject to extensive modification, generally in association with closer residential settlement, commercial or industrial uses\r\n6. Water - water features (water is regarded as an essential aspect of the classification, even though it is primarily a land cover type, not a land use)\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Update September 2017 is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). ACLUMP, of which ABARES is a partner, promotes the development of consistent information on land use and land management practices. This consortium of Australian, state and territory government partners is critical to providing nationally consistent land use mapping at both catchment and national scale, underpinned by common technical standards including an agreed national land use classification. ACLUMP provides a national land use data directory and the maintenance of land use datasets on Australian and state government data repositories.

    "description": "ABARES Lessons from the water market report analyses trends in water allocation prices in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), between 2000-01 and 2015-16. This report analyses the major demand and supply side drivers of water allocation prices in the sMDB, drawing on historical data for 2000-01 to 2015-16. The study disentangles the effects of climate variability (rainfall, water storage and allocation volumes) from the key policy changes (including Commonwealth purchase of entitlements for the environment) and irrigation sector changes that have occurred during the period. \r\n\r\nKey Issues • The main driver of change in water prices over this period has been variation in rainfall, storages and allocations. During the peak of the drought water prices jumped to more than $1 000 per ML, before dropping to near zero during the flood years (2010-11 and 2011-12). Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, storage volumes steadily decreased and prices steadily increased. \r\n• However, ABARES finds that even after controlling for these dry conditions, market prices during 2014-15 and 2015-16 were higher than expected from past experience. The report finds that these higher prices can be explained by a combination of demand and supply factors including: Commonwealth entitlement purchases, state carryover rule changes, interregional trade restrictions and commodity price fluctuations and irrigation land-use changes. \r\n• While Commonwealth entitlement purchases reduce the supply of water and have an upward effect on prices, these are offset to some extent by Commonwealth investments in water saving infrastructure. Further, even if water savings are ignored, Commonwealth entitlement purchases offer only a partial explanation for the increase in water prices. \r\n• Another important factor has been changes to carryover rules particularly in Victoria, which have led to large increases in carryover volumes since 2007-08. This increase carryover since 2007-08 has contributed to higher allocation prices in the market. Despite this, carryover remains a positive development that will benefit irrigators in the long run by keeping prices lower in drought years. \r\n",

    "description": "*Forests of Australia (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation\r\nand land cover data inputs, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as:\r\n\"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single\r\nstem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2021) (unpublished, also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2020), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map as forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This technical report estimates the responsiveness of demand for structural pine to changes in timber and steel prices. Measures of demand responsiveness can provide valuable insights into the potential implications of changes in policy or market settings on volumes and prices received by producers. The analysis focuses on estimating short-term price elasticities of demand--a formal measure of the sensitivity of demand--to changes in prices in the same quarter or recent past. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The estimates in this report suggest that the importance of timber and steel prices on the quantity of structural timber demanded in the short-run is limited. However, the volume of residential construction activity was found to have a substantial effect for demand of domestically produced structural pine products. In particular, new house commencements explain a great deal of the quarter-on-quarter changes in the quantity of domestic structural pine sales. This confirms the common assertion by industry that house commencements are the primary driver for structural timber demand within Australia. \r\n\r\n Looking forward, changes in consumer preferences, socio-demographic trends and building regulations will likely play a much greater role in the choice of building materials used in housing construction compared with timber and steel prices. Trends suggest consumers are placing more weight on the environmental benefits of structural materials. Changing architectural styles will change the material requirements for a standard home. A global trend towards higher-density living will likely promote a shift toward multi-unit buildings, with recent changes to the National Construction Code opening the way for increased timber use in the midrise construction market, leading to greater timber use in multi-level buildings. \r\n",

The ability to trace livestock allows Australia to respond quickly to food safety incidents and disease outbreaks. The purpose of this Decision Regulation Impact Statement (Decision RIS) is to recommend a preferred option for improving the NLIS for sheep and goats to meet the National Livestock Traceability Performance Standards. \r\n\r\n This Decision RIS identifies the nature of the problem to be solved and explains the rationale for the preferred option. It also assesses the costs and benefits of all the options under consideration. This Decision RIS follows the guidelines of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in the Best Practice Regulation Guide. It has been approved for release by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. ",

The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset. \r\n\r\n The update was necessary in order to align the forest cover types of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013) and also to introduce an attribute containing forest category information into the dataset. The update had no impact on the Indigenous land management categories reported by the Australia's Indigenous forest estate dataset, and minimal impact on the area of forest types reported against each land management category. \r\n\r\n\tThe  Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0 dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands, and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\n\tThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and SOFR 2013. The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are: 1.\tIndigenous owned and managed; \r\n2.\tIndigenous managed; \r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and \r\n4.\tOther Special rights. \r\n These categories align with the reporting requirements for the NIFS and SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is  the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012,  charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. \r\n\r\nGenerally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. \r\n\r\nThis dataset provides a record of the 2013 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2013 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2012 – 30 June 2013, for others it will be the 2013 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nFor the 2013 financial year (being the first period for reporting to the ACNC), the Commissioner exercised her discretion to extend the due date for lodgement to 31 March 2014. As at August 2014, approximately 42 000 registered charities have filed their 2013 AIS with the ACNC. The dataset is updated fortnightly.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the [ACNC Register](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity). There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information:\r\n\r\n-\tis commercially sensitive and it could cause harm\r\n-\tis false, confusing or misleading\r\n-\tis offensive\r\n-\tcould endanger public safety\r\n-\tfalls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund).\r\n\r\nSome charities have asked for their details to be withheld. If their withholding request is pending or has been approved, the AIS data relating to these charities has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity).\r\n\r\nThe 2013 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2013 reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS will ask further questions, particularly in relation to financial information for medium and large charities. The dataset of 2014 Annual Information Statements will be uploaded to data.gov.au in due course.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datatsets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://www.data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. ",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThis data relates to the average annual family income of broadacre and dairy\r\nfarm properties which responded to the ABARE annual farm survey over a three\r\nyear period from 1996 -1997 to 1998 -1999. Average annual family income is\r\ncalculated as the family share of farm income plus any wages (that are\r\nincluded as farm costs for taxation assessment) paid to the owner manager,\r\nspouse and dependant children, plus all off-farm income of owner manager and\r\nspouse. The data is reported at the Statistical Division (SD) level for\r\nAustralia. This data relates to broadacre and dairy farms run by owner\r\nmanagers and has been collected by annual farm survey interview and is\r\nsupplemented by information in the farm accounts. The data is presented at a\r\nscale of 25000000. The following attributes are contained within the dataset;\r\nSd code a a unique 3 digit code for Statistical Divisions (SD), Sd name a the\r\nname of the Statistical Division (SD), Faminc a the average annual farm family\r\nincome for the period 1996-1997 to 1998-1999. RSE a the relative standard\r\nerror of the average farm equity ratio for the period 1996-1997 to 1998-1999.\r\nAg_land_ha a hectares of agricultural land use in the Statistical Division\r\n(SD). Note that metropolitan areas are assigned a value of -99999, whilst\r\nareas with no data are assigned a value of -88888.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_afi__r9aa\r\n__00512a00.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2018 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This issue of the Australian forest and wood products statistics (AFWPS) includes updated 2015-16 data for key domestic indicators of forestry sector activity, including sales and service income and industry valued added. It also includes interim estimates of the volume and value of logs harvested in 2016-17, along with updated 2016-17 trade statistics for wood products and data for housing and other residential commencements. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Forestry industry value added, or contribution to GDP, increased for the third year in a row, growing by 9 per cent to $8.6 billion in 2015-16. Sales and service income for the forestry sector also grew strongly to $23.7 billion in 2015-16 (up 7 per cent from the previous year). \r\n• ABARES estimates that Australia's forestry sector continued to grow strongly in 2016-17, with the total volume and value of logs harvested reaching record levels. Estimated total volume log harvest from native forests and commercial plantations increased by 9 per cent to 32.8 million cubic metres and estimated total value increased by 12 per cent to $2.5 billion. \r\n• After four consecutive years of growth in residential construction activity in Australia, dwelling commencements fell by 6 per cent to 219,300 in 2016-17. The decrease in commencements of other residential buildings (including units and house conversions) was greater than the decrease in house commencements. \r\n• Australia's trade in wood products has been growing since 2012-13 and reached a record level of $8.6 billion in 2016-17. The value of exports reached a record level of $3.4 billion (up 9 per cent from the previous year), while the value of imports fell to $5.3 billion (down 4 per cent from a record level in the previous year). \r\n• China was our largest trading partner in 2016-17 for wood products, accounting for over a quarter of Australia's total wood product imports, nearly half of total wood product exports and the majority of total wood products export growth over the year. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for beef producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Beef producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that had at least 100 head of beef cattle on hand at 30 June 2015. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Average total cash receipts for Australian beef farms increased by around 14 per cent in 2014-15 to $391 000 and by a similar percentage in the following year to around $442 000. \r\n• The increases in total cash receipts largely reflected higher receipts from cattle sales, which were largely a result of higher cattle prices. \r\n• In real terms, estimated average farm cash incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 are among the highest recorded since 2000-01. \r\n• Northern region beef farms recorded higher average farm incomes than farms in the Southern region in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. \r\n• Reflecting higher incomes, the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for beef farms increased from -0.1 per cent in 2013-14 to 0.6 per cent in 2014-15 and is estimated to increase further in 2015-16 to around 1.9 per cent. \r\n• Average beef farm debt trended upwards, in real terms, between 2000-01 and 2014-15. In 2014-15 average total debt was around $460 000 a farm. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of a rapid increase in average farm size. \r\n• However, increases in debt over time has largely been supported by an accompanying increase in the total capital value of beef farms. Consequently, average farm business equity ratios remained relatively steady over the period 2000-01 to 2015-16. \r\n",

    "description": "Wine grape farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated wine grape farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on wine grape farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where most of the Basin's wine grapes are produced. Average farm cash incomes of wine grape farms rose from 2006-07 to 2011-12 before falling in 2012-13 in response to lower grape production. An increase in production contributed to slightly higher average farm cash incomes in 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n Grape crops in many areas of the Basin require regular irrigation because of the warm and relatively dry climate. From 2006-07 to 2014-15 the average volume of water used on wine grape farms mostly increased with this increase mainly due to an increase in average farm size. The proportion of grape farms using drip/trickle irrigation technologies has increased. \r\n\r\n The number of grape growers trading temporary water allocations varied from year to year. The years with the highest proportions of net buyers were 2007-08 and 2008-09. ",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for Plant Health Australia  \r\n Overview  \r\n Experience from overseas indicates that the cost of an incursion by black-striped mussel is likely to be large without management. This report presents a comparison of the estimated costs associated with the alternative responses to an incursion: eradication and containment. Hypothetical incursions of black-striped mussel in ten case study areas across four Australian ports were considered. The cost of eradicating the initial mussel incursion from a case study area is compared to the cost of containing the mussel population to the port encompassing the case study area. The findings indicate that eradication is in most cases the preferred and less costly option over a range of time scales with the caveat that the likelihood of successful eradication will depend on early detection and response. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n•  Mytilopsis sallei  (black-striped mussel) is an invasive marine species that has been translocated from its native range in the Caribbean to a large number of ports in southern and eastern Asia. \r\n• An incursion of black-striped mussel in Darwin in 1999 was successfully eradicated at a cost of in excess of $3.2 million in 2012 terms. This species has been reported to have become established in a number of overseas trading ports, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai. The risks of translocation to Australia have therefore increased in recent years. \r\n• If an incursion by this species is not managed, it has the potential to cause significant and widespread economic and environmental damage. \r\n• A comparison of the costs associated with eradication with those of containment and control in a range of scenarios found that in many cases eradication is the preferred option, but containment and control may be preferred in some situations. \r\n",

    "title": "ACNC 2014 Annual Information Statement data",
    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2014 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2014 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2013 – 30 June 2014, for others it will be the 2014 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nAs at November 2016, approximately 46 000 registered charities have submitted their 2014 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2014 reporting period. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS asked information about charity finances for the first time. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greated detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe maps represent a compilation of dryland salinity risk and hazard mapping\r\nfor 2000, 2020 and 2050. The map shows the broad distribution of areas\r\nconsidered as having either a high salinity risk or a high salinity hazard. In\r\nsouthern Australia where groundwater level and trend data are available,\r\nassessments that are more confident have been possible. However, in northern\r\nAustralia groundwater data for trend analysis are very sparse or non-existent.\r\nIn these regions, salinity assessments have been based on the presence of\r\ngeological, landscape, regolith, land use and climate attributes which are the\r\nprime drivers of salinity. This national map provides a basis for identifying\r\nthose regions where more detailed assessments are warranted, and where land\r\nuse changes should be targeted if the risks are to be managed.The bulk of non-\r\nagricultural areas in Western Australia, South Australia and western New South\r\nWales were considered to have a very low salinity risk and were not\r\nassessed.Please note that the Commonwealth and all suppliers of source data\r\nused to derive the maps of aAustralia, Forecast Areas Containing Land of High\r\nHazard or Risk of Dryland Salinity from 2000 to 2050a3 do not warrant the\r\naccuracy or completedness of information in this product.

    "description": "#Updated September 2021 to include land use tiles. These tiles address issues with analysis of the large single dataset.#\r\n\r\nThis vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. \r\n\r\nThe vector geodatabase has been cut into 7 shapefile tiles. This reduces the file size and enables more analysis. The extent of tiles is shown below:  \r\n•\tSwan Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth West Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth Coast Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tNorthern Agricultural Region Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tPeel Harvey Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tAvon Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tRangelands Natural Resource Management region\r\n",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##2021 AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2021 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2021 AIS data. This report - the 9th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover spatial datasets, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and Territory agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to the states' and territories' data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nForests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and the Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002. The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

    "title": "Australian honey bee industry: 2014-15 survey results",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n ABARES has produced a report containing the results of analysis of beekeeping financial and physical performance data collected from beekeeping businesses in 2015-16. Key performance measures for beekeeping businesses are presented, including analysis of pollination services, use of public lands, challenges facing the beekeeping industry and the extent to which research and information is sought and implemented. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES Australian Honey Bee Industry Survey conducted in 2016. It provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing the current situation of Australian beekeeping businesses, as well as monitoring changes from previous surveys conducted in 2002 and 2008. \r\n\r\n The survey was funded by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, as part of the Australian Government's response to a recommendation from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report from 2014 on the future of the beekeeping and pollination service industries in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Over 13,000 registered beekeepers operate across Australia. The number of commercial beekeepers fell by 25 per cent over the 10 years to 2015-16. \r\n• Most honey produced came from non-agricultural private land (39 per cent) or public land (39 per cent). 23 per cent was produced from agricultural land. Larger businesses were more likely to derive a greater proportion of total honey produced from public land. \r\n• The majority of beekeeping cash receipts came from honey sales (85 per cent) in 2014-15. Cash receipts from paid pollination were the second largest component of receipts (11 per cent). Business cash income averaged $70 400 and was significantly higher in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. \r\n• Small operators had negative business profit and rate of return in 2014-15, while small-medium, medium and large operators experienced increasingly large positive rates of return and business profit. \r\n• Paid pollination was conducted by around 44 per cent of beekeepers in 2014-15. The proportion of beekeepers and the value of payments received were higher in areas that produced large amounts of bee-pollination dependent crops such as almonds and cherries. \r\n• Drought was the most commonly cited challenge to honey production by beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 (70 per cent of beekeepers). Half of beekeeping businesses indicated that the use of agricultural chemicals negatively impacted floral resources available and thus their honey production. \r\n• The most common disease and pest affecting beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 were chalkbrood and the small hive beetle. The greatest financial impacts were caused by the small hive beetle and American foulbrood. \r\n• Nearly three quarters of beekeeping businesses changed their management practices in 2014-15 as a result of research. Large businesses were more responsive to research findings than smaller operators. \r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\nAustralia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 report presents forecasts of sawlog and pulplog volumes available from softwood and hardwood plantations. Changes in log availability have important implications for Australia's rural economies; the size, type and geographical location of wood and paper product manufacturing industries; the national supply of wood products; Australia's trade balance; and Australia's export income. \r\n\r\n This report has been prepared by ABARES under the auspices of the National Plantation Inventory--a program that has collected data and reported on plantations established primarily for wood production in Australia since 1993. Comprehensive plantation log availability forecast reports are published every five years and Australia's plantation log supply 2015-2059 is the fifth log supply report. \r\n\r\n In this report, forecasts are presented for softwood and hardwood sawlog and pulplog volumes by National Plantation Inventory region, based on the combination of forecasts supplied by plantation owners and managers through a survey and ABARES modelled forecasts. For the modelled forecasts, ABARES did not account for any future changes in social, economic or environmental parameters. \r\n\r\n Key Points  \r\n• The potential log availability from Australia's commercial plantation estate is forecast to increase to an annual average of 29.7 million cubic metres in the 2015-19 period, followed by a decline to an annual average of 27.0 million cubic metres a year for the 2020-24 period. The 2015 to 2059 average total plantation log availability forecast is 10 per cent lower in this report, compared with the 2012 log supply report; the average hardwood log availability forecast is 21 per cent lower and the average softwood log availability forecast is 2 per cent lower. \r\n• The majority of the decline in total log availability is because the expected yield from hardwood plantations is forecast to decline as plantations of low commerciality are not replanted and some lease agreements with landholders are not renewed. \r\n• ABARES estimates that the total commercial plantation estate may decrease by around 80 000 to 100 000 hectares over the next 10 to 15 years as new plantation establishment will not be sufficient to offset removals of low commerciality plantations unless there are new drivers to expand or maintain the current plantation estate. \r\n",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "This technical report uses farm survey data to measure the contribution of cross-farm resource reallocation to industry-level productivity growth within Australian broadacre agriculture. The results show that resource reallocation between farms accounted for around half the industry-level productivity growth that occurred between 1978 and 2010, and its contribution appears to have increased over time. This effect is mainly caused by the asymetric impact of technological progress on incumbent farms, as reflected in difference in productivity growth and the relative mobility of different production factors. These findings provide useful insights for policy-makers considering industry-level reforms as a means of imrpving aggregate agricultural productivity. ",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall.

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU sugar industry, EU almond industry and investment on Australia's farms. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 3.3 per cent to around $58.4 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 3.8 per cent increase to $56.5 billion in 2015-16. If realised, the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 13 per cent higher than the five-year average of $51.8 billion between 2011-12 and 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to remain largely unchanged at $29.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 6.6 per cent to $29.2 billion in 2016-17. This mainly reflects forecast increases in the gross values of horticulture, cotton and oilseed production offsetting forecast decreases in the gross values of wheat and barley production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to fall slightly to $44 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.3 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.5 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to fall in 2016-17 are beef and veal (-12 per cent), dairy products (-1 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (-4 per cent), chickpeas (-32 per cent) and mutton (-17 per cent). Export earnings for wheat are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• The forecast decreases in 2016-17 are expected to be partly offset by forecast rises in export earnings for wool (6 per cent), sugar (21 per cent), wine (1 per cent), cotton (40 per cent), lamb (3 per cent) and canola (43 per cent). \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 8 per cent to $1.7 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.8 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia averaged 2.9 per cent in 2015-16 and is assumed to average 2.7 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2016-17, largely unchanged from the estimated average for 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU sugar industry  \r\n• The EU sugar market is highly regulated, with domestic price support, export subsidies and import restrictions. This stocktake of EU domestic and trade policies that support the EU sugar market will inform government and industry in the lead up to the commencement of Australia-EU FTA negotiations. \r\n• Australia's access to the EU sugar market is constrained by a country-specific tariff rate quota. Any improved access through either lower tariffs or increased quota would improve Australia's competitiveness in that market. \r\n\r\n The EU almond industry  \r\n• The European Union is the world's largest consumer and importer of almonds and has been a growing export market for Australian almonds since 2005-06. \r\n• However, significant benefits from an Australian-EU FTA are unlikely for Australian almonds because import tariffs are already low and equal to those faced by the United States, the main supplier to this market. \r\n\r\n Investment in Australian farms  \r\n• Investment in Australian farms is substantial, with net additions of non-land capital items on broadacre and dairy farms currently worth around $2 billion a year. \r\n• Farm operators and their spouses provide most of the capital used to fund the ownership and operation of Australian farms; corporate investors account for less than one-fifth of total capital. The strength of the family farm business structure suggests that corporate investors are unlikely to significantly displace family farmers in the near future. \r\n",

    "description": "## This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at March 2014. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (1997 to 2012) and scale of mapping (1:25 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 7, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. ",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2000 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a01.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The beef sectors of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have grown significantly over the past two decades. This report profiles the beef industries of these four beef exporting South American nations, as well as Australia, and evaluates the trends and key factors behind the growth in real export values since 2000. Forward looking scenario analysis based on actual and hypothetical changes to policies and operating environments is undertaken to assess the potential impacts on Australia's future beef exports. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n\r\n Global demand for beef is expected to expand significantly over the next several decades, especially in Asia, which will present opportunities for exporters. \r\n\r\n Australia and South America, together, account for almost half of world trade in beef. \r\n\r\n South America is emerging as a significant competitor for the Australian beef industry, as market access to Australia's traditional markets is improving. \r\n\r\n For the five beef exporting countries profiled in this report, improved market access was the main driver of real export revenue growth (in 2000 US dollar terms) between 2000 and 2014. Other contributing drivers include changes in export supply costs, exchange rate movements and growth in demand for beef. \r\n\r\n Three forward-looking scenarios assess the potential change to export growth from 2014 to 2030 from changes in domestic and international operating environments. These include: the removal of Argentine agricultural export requirements; improved market access for South American beef; and improvements in transport infrastructure for Brazil and Australia. \r\n\r\n To maintain its export competitiveness, Australia will need to: 1. improve productivity growth both on and off the farm \r\n2. continue to target premium markets and improve market access in order to be responsive to changes in the market \r\n3. maintain a production system that ensures its status as a clean and green beef producer so that it will be able to distinguish itself on quality when it cannot compete on price with lower-cost exporters. \r\n",

The Indigenous use and rights information was sourced from multiple Indigenous land ownership, land management and land rights datasets from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies. The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset. The dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR). The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are:\r\n1.\tIndigenous owned and managed;\r\n2.\tIndigenous managed;\r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and\r\n4.\tOther Special rights.\r\nThese categories align with the reporting requirements of the SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.\r\n",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The December edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities in 2015-16, and updates the outlook ABARES released in September 2015. \r\n\r\n In addition to commodity forecasts, this publication includes two boxes: \r\n• seasonal conditions in Australia \r\n• farm cash income of broadacre farms \r\n and one article: • key agricultural outcomes of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. \r\n\r\nFarmer/stakeholder implications \r\n The Agricultural commodities report provides high quality and timely information that supports higher farm gate returns through informed decision making by primary producers. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8 per cent in 2015-16 to around $57.6 billion, following an estimated increase of 4 per cent to $53.5 billion in 2014-15. At this forecast level, the gross value of farm production in 2015-16 would be around 17 per cent higher than the average of $49.4 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 13 per cent in 2015-16 to $30.0 billion following an estimated increase of 16 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects expected increases in the farmgate prices for beef cattle, lamb, sheep and wool. \r\n• The forecast increases in farmgate prices are expected to more than offset a forecast decline of 5 per cent in the volume index of livestock production in 2015-16. This mainly reflects an assumption of more favourable seasonal conditions in the latter half of 2015-16 leading to reduced slaughter as a result of herd and flock rebuilding. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 2 per cent in 2015-16 to $27.6 billion alongside an expected increase of 2 per cent in the volume index of crop production. This mainly reflects increases in horticultural production offsetting the falling world prices of grains and oilseeds. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $44.0 billion in 2015-16, following a rise of 6 per cent to an estimated $43.6 billion in 2014-15. At this level, export earnings from farm commodities in 2015-16 would be around 15 per cent higher than the average of $38.2 billion over the five years to 2014-15 in nominal terms. \r\n• Agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2015-16 include: wheat (up 3 per cent to $5.7 billion), wool (9 per cent to $3.5 billion), wine (3 per cent to $2.1 billion), lamb (1 per cent to $1.7 billion), sugar (8 per cent to $1.4 billion), live feeder/slaughter cattle (16 per cent to $1.3 billion) and chickpeas (56 per cent to $0.6 billion). \r\n• These forecast increases are expected to be largely offset by forecast falls in export earnings from beef and veal (down 3 per cent to $8.6 billion), dairy (6 per cent to $2.3 billion), coarse grains (14 per cent to $2.3 billion), canola (8 per cent to $1.2 billion), cotton (21 per cent to $1.2 billion) and mutton (2 per cent to $0.8 billion). \r\n• Export earnings from fisheries products are forecast to increase by 17 per cent to around $1.7 billion in 2015-16, after increasing by an estimated 10 per cent to $1.4 billion in 2014-15. \r\n• The index of unit export returns for Australian farm exports is forecast to rise by 7 per cent in 2015-16, following an estimated rise of 6 per cent in 2014-15. The forecast increase in 2015-16 mainly reflects the effect of the assumed lower value of the Australian dollar, especially against the US dollar. \r\n• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of beef and veal, wool, wine, lamb, live feeder/slaughter cattle, rock lobster, mutton and chickpeas are forecast to increase in 2015-16. In contrast, export prices of wheat, barley, sugar and dairy products are forecast to decline. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n• World economic growth is assumed to be 3.1 per cent in 2015 and 3.4 per cent in 2016. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2015-16, compared with 2.2 per cent in 2014-15. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average around US72 cents in 2015-16, 14 per cent lower than the average of US84 cents in 2014-15. \r\n",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2023 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2023 AIS data. This report - the 11th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",
