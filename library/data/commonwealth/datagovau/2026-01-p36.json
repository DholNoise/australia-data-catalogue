    "description": "This Bio Acoustic data was collected in February/March 2010 under the IMOS Ship of Opportunity (SOOP) Bio Acoustic (BA) program on Austral Fisheries FV Southern Champion (IMOS platform code: VHGI).\n\nDeparted:  Australia, February 27, 2010\nArrived:  \t Australia, March 3, 2010\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the sheep (June joining) model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP for urgent medical care in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nShort description: A network of natural and semi-natural areas which support critical ecosystem services, including connected native species habitats, and which provide for implementation of living infrastructure, active travel, climate adaptation and community wellbeing outcomes. An output of the Connecting Nature, Connecting People program, developed to guide land use and management decisions.\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\nMETHODS\nData collection / creation: The ecological network was initially derived from potential habitat and connectivity model outputs for grassland, woodland and aquatic-riparian ecosystems. These model outputs indicate potential habitat areas, fragmentation and whether a patch is big enough to provide core or corridor habitat functions for specific taxa groups. The network was created by identifying key patches of core habitat and corridors, as well as missing links that could reconnect fragmented patches. These were reviewed by several ecologists until the proposed network was agreed upon.\nThese agreed areas were converted to spatial data. Polygons were drawn around the relevant potential habitat and connectivity model outputs to simplify the data and visualise connections between habitat patches. The output was overlaid over other environmental data, including sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways and many more. Boundaries were adjusted to reflect these values as needed.\nThe ecological network was reviewed by subject matter experts and tested in a draft policy document released for public comment. Further revisions to boundaries were made following feedback. The final layer was dissolved and checked for geometry issues. \nNOTES ON USE\nQuality: The network considers an abundance and variety of datasets, including protected areas, potential habitat and connectivity maps, distribution of sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways, restoration projects, urban open spaces and community sites. Data was sourced from authoritative sources where possible. The network was verified and refined through wide distribution and review of the draft dataset, including by ACT Government ecologists and community members. Where possible, polygon boundaries were drawn around existing features (such as lakes or mapped habitat). Polygons were checked against the most recent aerial imagery to verify values and boundaries. This broad review of existing data and consultation on the output provides confidence the output represents the extent of our collective knowledge and provides a holistic illustration of known values.\nLimitations: The urban ACT Ecological network is a concept only. Polygon boundaries are hand drawn and imprecise. The data has not been ground-truthed. Boundaries should be considered approximate and verified with additional data and ground surveys. Further, the network does not assess feasibility or priorities. It does not consider species presence or absence, habitat condition, management regimes or tenure. This information should be gathered for decision making by referring to other environmental datasets, undertaking ground surveys and consulting with subject matter experts. \nData refinement: The dataset could be further improved by testing corridors against a feasibility ruleset (e.g. distance between core patches, width). Additionally, future research may support a wider range of uses by adopting a more technical approach to establish polygon boundaries or areas of interest. This would support higher spatial accuracy and enable greater certainty on what areas are within the network. A quantitative approach could support spatial statistics to aid decision making, e.g. through the ability to prioritise corridors. The Least-Cost Pathway Method is recommended for further study.\nSHARING\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0623S, 150.7672E) between 13/9/90 and 30/10/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nUsers should be aware that there appears to be some distortion of data within these files. For example, the depth data recorded by the meter maintained around 11.5m produced negative values and also readings of 132m! Salinity readings from the 5.5m current meter are also missing for the start of the record.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 5.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Modelling of landscape capacity for 75 landscape-managed NSW threatened species. \n\nLandscape capacity is a measure of how usable habitat is for supporting populations based on the quality of habitat and how easily species can move across the landscape to access sufficient resources to support a population. This project maps climate-informed landscape capacity. This mapping shows how well NSW landscapes can support fauna populations into future climate. The location of climate refugia are identified. These are areas that support species populations through time, from pre-industrial times and into the future.\n\nThe methods and descriptions of outputs are provided in the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/persistence-landscapes-project\">project report</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/d44cb0df-0242-4db3-9126-8c26aba7f80a/resource/27c36e75-690e-4fcd-88b4-b89bbdfafeba/download/plp_reportcards_final2025.pdf\">Two page species forecasts</a> summarise results for each species. \n\nEach species model is projected into NARCliM (v1.0) climate futures. The dataset comprises: individual models for 1750, 2000, 2030 and 2070 epochs; 'consensus' maps across 12 climate models for 2070; and multi-species refugia and landscape capacity across time maps (<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/edf6e375-57c5-4f55-93f0-422a0af1900c\">for the 75 threatened species</a>, and also including site-managed species <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/c76d5cd9-b3d1-4622-a4d5-55aed553e38b\">here</a>). \n\nThe individual species geotiff files are grouped into zip files which are large and may take considerable time to download.\n\nThese resources are outputs of the Persistence in the Landscape Project (PLP). \n\nThis item contains landscape capacity rasters for the following species, for pre-industrial (1750), 2000, 2030 and 2070, based on NARCliM 1.0 projections:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Artamus cyanopterus cyanopterus</em>,    <strong>Dusky Woodswallow</strong></li>\n<li><em>Atrichornis rufescens</em>,  <strong>Rufous Scrub-bird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Botaurus poiciloptilus</em>, <strong>Australasian Bittern</strong></li>\n<li><em>Burhinus grallarius</em>,    <strong>Bush Stone-curlew</strong></li>\n<li><em>Callocephalon fimbriatum</em>, <strong>Gang-gang Cockatoo</strong></li>\n<li><em>Calyptorhynchus banksii samueli</em>, <strong>Red-tailed Black-Cockatoo</strong> (inland subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Calyptorhynchus lathami</em>, <strong>South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo</strong>- updated to <em>Calyptorhynchus lathami lathami</em> in the report</li>\n<li><em>Certhionyx variegatus</em>, <strong>Pied Honeyeater</strong></li>\n<li><em>Chthonicola sagittata</em>, <strong>Speckled Warbler</strong> - updated to <em>Pyrrholaemus sagittatus</em> in the report</li>\n<li><em>Cinclosoma castanotum</em>, <strong>Chestnut Quail-thrush</strong></li>\n<li><em>Circus assimilis</em>, <strong>Spotted Harrier</strong></li>\n<li><em>Climacteris picumnus victoriae</em>, <strong>Brown Treecreeper</strong> (eastern subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Coracina lineata</em>, <strong>Barred Cuckoo-shrike</strong></li>\n<li><em>Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni</em>, <strong>Coxen's Fig-Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Daphoenositta chrysoptera</em>, <strong>Varied Sittella</strong></li>\n<li><em>Dasyornis brachypterus</em>, <strong>Eastern Bristlebird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Glossopsitta pusilla</em>, <strong>Little Lorikeet</strong> - updated to <em>Parvipsitta pusilla</em> in the report </li>\n<li><em>Grantiella picta</em>, <strong>Painted Honeyeater</strong></li>\n<li><em>Hieraaetus morphnoides</em>, <strong>Little Eagle</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ixobrychus flavicollis</em>, <strong>Black Bittern</strong></li>\n<li><em>Lathamus discolor</em>, <strong>Swift Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Lophochroa leadbeateri</em>, <strong>Pink Cockatoo</strong></li>\n<li><em>Melanodryas cucullata cucullata</em>, <strong>Hooded Robin</strong> (south-eastern form)</li>\n<li><em>Melithreptus gularis gularis</em>, <strong>Black-chinned Honeyeater</strong> (eastern subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Menura alberti</em>, <strong>Albert's Lyrebird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Neophema pulchella</em>, <strong>Turquoise Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ninox connivens</em>, <strong>Barking Owl</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ninox strenua</em>, <strong>Powerful Owl</strong></li>\n<li><em>Oxyura australis</em>, <strong>Blue-billed Duck</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pachycephala inornata</em>, <strong>Gilbert's Whistler</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pachycephala olivacea</em>, <strong>Olive Whistler</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pandion cristatus</em>, <strong>Eastern Osprey</strong></li>\n<li><em>Petroica boodang</em>, <strong>Scarlet Robin</strong></li>\n<li><em>Petroica phoenicea</em>, <strong>Flame Robin</strong></li>\n<li><em>Podargus ocellatus</em>, <strong>Marbled Frogmouth</strong></li>\n<li><em>Polytelis swainsonii</em>, <strong>Superb Parrot</strong> (breeding)</li>\n<li><em>Ptilinopus magnificus</em>, <strong>Wompoo Fruit-Dove</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ptilinopus regina</em>, <strong>Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove</strong></li>\n<li><em>Stagonopleura guttata</em>, <strong>Diamond Firetail</strong></li>\n<li><em>Stictonetta naevosa</em>, <strong>Freckled Duck</strong></li>\n<li><em>Tyto tenebricosa</em>, <strong>Sooty Owl</strong></li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "Site NTB-9 is sampled monthly by Nyrstar Hobart as part of the  Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "In March and April, 2012, Geoscience Australia undertook a seabed characterisation survey, aimed at supporting the assessment of CO2 storage potential of the Vlaming Sub-basin, Western Australia.  The survey, undertaken as part of the National CO2 Infrastructure Plan program was targeted to provide an understanding of the link between the deep geological features of the area and the seabed, and connectivity between them as possible evidence for seal integrity.  Data was acquired in two sections of the Rottnest Shelf lying above the regional seal - the South Perth Shale - and the underlying potentially CO2-suitable reservoir, the Gage Sandstone. Seabed samples were taken from 43 stations, and included 89 seabed grab samples.  A total of 653 km2 of multibeam and backscatter data was obtained. Chirper shallow sub-bottom profile data was acquired concurrently. 6.65 km2 of side-scan sonar imagery was also obtained. The two surveyed areas, (Area 1 and Area 2), are set within a shallow sediment starved shelf setting. Area 2, situated to the southwest of Rottnest Island, is characterised by coralline red algal (rhodolith) beds, with ridges and mounds having significant rhodolith accumulations. The geomorphic expression of structural discontinuities outcropping at the seabed is evident by the presence of linear fault-like structures notable in Area 1, and north-south trending lineaments in Area 2. North-south trending structural lineaments on the outer section of Area 2 have in places, mounds standing 4-5 m above the seafloor in water depths of 80-85 m.  Although there are apparent spatial correlations between seabed geomorphology and the structural geology of the basin, the precise relationship between ridges and mounds that are overlain by rhodolith accumulations, fluid seepage, and Vlaming Sub-basin geology is uncertain, and requires further work to elucidate any links.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R2.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, January 06, 2012\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January, 2012\n\nData was collected from 7th-12th of January.\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Canberra East SA2 by AURIN.",

    "description": "This dataset presents extent and condition data for Australian rivers and streams for three time periods: 2010–11, 2015–16 and 2020–21.\r\n\r\nFreshwater ecological condition, especially that of rivers, is known to be influenced strongly by adjacent land use. Land Use Intensity (LUI), extracted from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARES) Land Use data [(Land use of Australia 2010–11 to 2020–21)](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/land-use-of-australia-2010-11-to-2020-21), is used as a proxy for inferring the condition (landscape characteristic) of freshwater ecosystems. \r\n\r\nLand Use Intensity (LUI) is defined by the ALUM classification [(Australian Land Use and Management Classification Version 8 (October 2016))](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification) as a measure of the intensity of different land uses, with the primary classes ordered from 1 (mostly natural) to 5 (intensive uses) in terms of increasing intensity. Category 6 represents areas obscured by water bodies. These areas are excluded from the ordinal classification as they do not have associated land-use intensity levels, thus cannot be used as a proxy for river condition.\r\n\r\nThe data was compiled using river extent data sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) [Geofabric v3.3](https://www.bom.gov.au/water/geofabric). River segments were created based on two characteristics: River Region, which are reporting regions for major river catchments in Australia, sourced from the Regions product within the BoM Geofabric v3.3; and Ecosystem Functional Group (EFG), which is the finest level of the [International Union for Conservation of Nature’s](https://iucn.org/) [Global Ecosystem Typology](https://global-ecosystems.org/) (IUCN GET) classification system.\r\n\r\nThe river segments were further broken down by assigning the LUI category for each of the corresponding time periods. Spatial layers representing Land Use Intensity were overlaid with river segments, allowing each segment to inherit the LUI classification from the adjacent land use. The subsequent river fragments were then grouped into multipart line features, with each feature representing a unique combination of River Region, EFG, and LUI for each period. This process is described in the [National Ecosystem Accounts, experimental estimates Methodology](https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/national-ecosystem-accounts-experimental-estimates-methodology/2020-21).\r\n\r\nThis dataset was used to produce summary statistics for the [National Ecosystem Accounts, experimental estimates](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/environment/environmental-accounts/national-ecosystem-accounts-experimental-estimates/2020-21). The statistics provide an overview of river condition across river regions, states and territories, based on the total length of rivers that fall within each of the LUI categories. ",

The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Flood Hazard and North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory.

This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions.

    "description": "This data was collected in March 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS042008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, March 20, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, March 26, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

This dataset contains locations of Wilson's stoorm petrel nests, mapped in the Mawson region during 2004-2005 season. Location of nests were recorded with handheld Trimble Geoexplorer GPS receivers, differentially corrected and stored as an Arcview point shapefile(ESRI software). Descriptive information relating to each bird nest was recorded and a detailed description of data fields is provided in description of the shapefile. A text  file also provide the attribute information (formatted for input into R statistical software).\n\nThis work has been completed as part of ASAC project 2704 (ASAC_2704).\n\nFields recorded\n\n   Species\n\n   Activity\n\n   Type\n\n   Entrances\n\n   Slope\n\n   Remnants\n\n   Latitude\n\n   Longitude\n\n   Date\n\n   Snow\n\n   Eggchick\n\n   Cavitysize\n\n   Cavitydepth\n\n   Distnn\n\n   Substrate\n\n   Comments\n\n   SitedotID\n\n   Aspect\n\n   Firstfred",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

A complex flood frequency\nprocedure was necessary to account for the attenuation of floods by Burrendong Dam and the\ncoincidence of peaks on the Macquarie and Bell Rivers. It is very difficult to estimate the\naccuracy of the design discharges predicted by the flood frequency analysis. Several factors\nlimit the accuracy of the discharges obtained, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Uncertainty associated with gauging station rating curves and,</li>\n<li>Relatively short length of records for hydrologic data.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDesign flood levels and velocities were calculated using a computer based one-dimensional\nunsteady flow hydraulic model. Flood levels have been quoted to the nearest 0.1 m, the\naccepted limit of accuracy for hydraulic models. This aspect must be borne in mind when\nusing the results for development purposes.\n\nFlood mitigation options should be considered as part of a floodplain management study. The\nMIKE 11 hydraulic model developed as part of this study can be used to model flood\nmitigation options.\n\nThree rock weirs have recently been constructed in the Bell River to control the bed and bank\nerosion. Over a period the many years, the bed level of the Bell River may rise as sediment is\ndeposited upstream of these weirs. The effect this would have on flood levels should also be\nconsidered in the floodplain management study.\n\nUntil a floodplain management study and floodplain management plan can be completed,\ncouncil should formulate a interim flood policy. This interim plan should be based on the\nlevels and velocities contained in this report.",

This will secure long-term protection of biodiversity and associated environmental values. The policy recognises the protection and management of significant bushland areas as a fundamental consideration in the planning process, while also seeking to integrate and balance wider environmental, social and economic considerations. In general terms, the policy does not prevent development where it consistent with the policy measures in this policy and other planning and environmental considerations.\n\nThe three key objectives of this policy are:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nto establish a conservation system at the regional level (through Bush Forever areas and to operate with the clearing controls under the Environmental Protection Act 1986) that is, as far as is achievable, comprehensive, adequate and representative of the ecological communities of the Swan Coastal Plain portion of the Perth Metropolitan Region; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nto seek to protect and manage significant bushland recommended for protection and management for conservation purposes through a range of implementation mechanisms and as a collective and shared responsibility and general duty of care on the part of government, landowners and the community; and \n</li>\n<li>\n\nto provide a policy and implementation framework for significant bushland areas recommended for protection and management to assist conservation planning, planning assessment and decision-making processes.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\n\n\nSILO is a Queensland Government database containing continuous daily climate data for Australia from 1889 to present. Gridded datasets are constructed by spatially interpolating the observed point data. Continuous point datasets are constructed by supplementing the available point data with interpolated estimates when observed data are missing.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nSILO provides climate datasets that are ready to use. Raw observational data typically contain missing data and are only available at the location of meteorological recording stations. SILO provides point datasets with no missing data and gridded datasets which cover mainland Australia and some islands.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nLineage statement:\n\n(A)\tProcessing System Version History\n\n\\*\tPrior to 2001\n\nThe interpolation system used the algorithm detailed in Jeffrey et al.1\n\n\\*\t2001-2009\n\nThe normalisation procedure was modified. Observational rainfall, when accumulated over a sufficient period and raised to an appropriate fractional power, is (to a reasonable approximation) normally distributed. In the original procedure the fractional power was fixed at 0.5 and a normal distribution was fitted to the transformed data using a maximum likelihood technique. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the goodness of fit, with a threshold value of 0.8. In 2001 the procedure was modified to allow the fractional power to vary between 0.4 and 0.6. The normalisation parameters (fractional power, mean and standard deviation) at each station were spatially interpolated using a thin plate smoothing spline.\n\n\\*\t2009-2011\n\nThe normalisation procedure was modified. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was removed, enabling normalisation parameters to be computed for all stations having sufficient data. Previously parameters were only computed for those stations having data that were adequately modelled by a normal distribution, as determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\n\\*\tJanuary 2012 - November 2012\n\nThe normalisation procedure was modified:\n\no\tThe Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test was reintroduced, with a threshold value of 0.1.\n\no\tData from Bellenden Ker Top station were included in the computation of normalisation parameters. The station was previously omitted on the basis of having insufficient data. It was forcibly included to ensure the steep rainfall gradient in the region was reflected in the normalisation parameters.\n\no\tThe elevation data used when interpolating normalisation parameters were modified. Previously a mean elevation was assigned to each station, taken from the nearest grid cell in a 0.05&#xB0;   0.05&#xB0; digital elevation model. The procedure was modified to use the actual station elevation instead of the mean. In mountainous regions the discrepancy was substantial and cross validation tests showed a significant improvement in error statistics.\n\no\tThe station data are normalised using: (i) a power parameter extracted from the nearest pixel in the gridded power surface. The surface was obtained by interpolating the power parameters fitted at station locations using a maximum likelihood algorithm; and (ii) mean and standard deviation parameters which had been fitted at station locations using a smoothing spline. Mean and standard deviation parameters were fitted at the subset of stations having at least 40 years of data, using a maximum likelihood algorithm. The fitted data were then spatially interpolated to construct: (a) gridded mean and standard deviation surfaces (for use in a subsequent de-normalisation procedure); and (b) interpolated estimates of the parameters at all station locations (not just the subset having long data records). The parameters fitted using maximum likelihood (at the subset of stations having long data records) may differ from those fitted by the interpolation algorithm, owing to the smoothing nature of the spline algorithm which was used. Previously, station data were normalised using mean and standard deviation parameters which were taken from the nearest pixel in the respective mean and standard deviation surfaces.\n\n\\*\tNovember 2012 - May 2013\n\nThe algorithm used for selecting monthly rainfall data for interpolation was modified. Prior to November 2012, the system was as follows:\n\no\tAccumulated monthly rainfall was computed by the Bureau of Meteorology;\n\no\tRainfall accumulations spanning the end of a month were assigned to the last month included in the accumulation period;\n\no\tA monthly rainfall value was provided for all stations which submitted at least one daily report. Zero rainfall was assumed for all missing values; and\n\no\tSILO imposed a complex set of ad-hoc rules which aimed to identify stations which had ceased reporting in real time. In such cases it would not be appropriate to assume zero rainfall for days when a report was not available. The rules were only applied when processing data for January 2001 and onwards.\n\nIn November 2012 a modified algorithm was implemented:\n\no\tSILO computed the accumulated monthly rainfall by summing the daily reports;\n\no\tRainfall accumulations spanning the end of a month were discarded;\n\no\tA monthly rainfall value was not computed for a given station if any day throughout the month was not accounted for - either through a daily report or an accumulation; and\n\no\tThe SILO ad-hoc rules were not applied.\n\n\\*\tMay 2013 - current\n\nThe algorithm used for selecting monthly rainfall data for interpolation was modified. The modified algorithm is only applied to datasets for the period October 2001 - current and is as follows:\n\no\tSILO computes the accumulated monthly rainfall by summing the daily reports;\n\no\tRainfall accumulations spanning the end of a month are pro-rata distributed onto the two months included in the accumulation period;\n\no\tA monthly rainfall value is computed for all stations which have at least 21 days accounted for throughout the month. Zero rainfall is assumed for all missing values; and\n\no\tThe SILO ad-hoc rules are applied when processing data for January 2001 and onwards.\n\nDatasets for the period January 1889-September 2001 are prepared using the system that was in effect prior to November 2012.\n\n\n\nLineage statement:\n\n(A)\tProcessing System Version History\n\nNo changes have been made to the processing system since SILO's inception.\n\n(B)\tMajor Historical Data Updates\n\n\\*\tAll observational data and station coordinates were updated in 2009. \n\n\\*\tStation coordinates were updated on 26 January 2012.\n\n \n\nProcess step:\n\nThe observed data are interpolated using a tri-variate thin plate smoothing spline, with latitude, longitude and elevation as independent variables.4 A two-pass interpolation system is used. All available observational data are interpolated in the first pass and residuals computed for all data points. The residual is the difference between the observed and interpolated values. Data points with high residuals may be indicative of erroneous data and are excluded from a subsequent interpolation which generates the &#xFB01;nal gridded surface. The surface covers the region 112&#x2DA;E - 154&#x2DA;E, 10&#x2DA;S - 44&#x2DA;S on a regular 0.05&#x2DA; &#xD7; 0.05&#x2DA;grid and is restricted to land areas on mainland Australia and some islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nGridded datasets for the period 1957-current are obtained by interpolation of the raw data. \n\nGridded datasets for the period 1957-current are obtained by interpolation of the raw data. Gridded datasets for the period 1889-1956 were constructed using an anomaly interpolation technique. The daily departure from the long term mean is interpolated, and the gridded dataset is constructed by adding the gridded anomaly to the gridded long term mean. The long term means were constructed using data from the period 1957-2001. The anomaly interpolation technique is described in Rayner et al.6  \n\n\n\nThe observed and interpolated datasets evolve as new data becomes available and the existing data are improved through quality control procedures. Modifications gradually decrease over time, with most datasets undergoing little change 12 months after the date of observation.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\n\"Queensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts\" (2013) SILO Patched Point data for Narrabri (54120) and Gunnedah (55023) stations in the Namoi subregion.

    "description": "The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) sub-facility aims to enable accurate, quality controlled, SST data to be supplied in near real-time (within 24 hours) from SOOPs and research vessels in the Australian region.\n\nRemotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data is an important input to ocean, numerical weather prediction, seasonal and climate models.  In order to improve calibration and validation of satellite SST in the Australian region, there is a need for high quality in situ SST observations with greater timeliness, spatial and temporal coverage than is currently available.  Regions particularly lacking in moored or drifting buoy observations are the Western Pacific Tropical Warm Pool region (Indonesia), close to the Australian coast (including Bass Strait) and the Southern Ocean.  Current ship SST observations from ships of opportunity (SOOP) are either of questionable accuracy or difficult to access in a timely manner.  \n\nThere are five vessels carrying automatic weather stations (AWS) that participate in the Australian Volunteer Observing Fleet (AVOF) program and two vessels equipped with a newly designed system for real-time SST data acquisition. Their routes include the Southern Ocean, coastal Australia (Queensland to South Australia), Bass Strait, Pacific Ocean, South-East Asia and the Tasman Sea. Four AVOF vessels with hull-mounted temperature sensors (Sea Bird SBE 48) and one with a digital oceanographic thermometer (Sea Bird SBE 38, RV L’Astrolabe) are supplying high-quality bulk SST data hourly. There is also one passenger ferry that is currently taking SST measurements using the high-accuracy SBE 38 sensor (MV SeaFlyte – Hillarys Harbour-Rottnest Island). In addition, there are now near real-time SST data streams available from two Australian research vessels (RV Southern Surveyor and RSV Aurora Australis), one New Zealand research vessel (RV Tangaroa), and a small research vessel operated by CSIRO near the south-east coast of Western Australia (RV Linnaeus). In total, twelve vessels send SST data in real-time. All SST data are being quality assured, placed on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and fed into the Bureau of Meteorology's near real-time satellite SST data validation system and operational regional and global SST analyses. Additionally, there are historical SST observations from four vessels which are not currently available in real-time: passenger ferry MV Fantasea, Whitsundays area, radiometer and bulk SST (November 2008 to March 2010); two AVOF vessels: MV Iron Yandi (February 2010 to January 2011) and PV Pacific Sun (December 2010 to July 2012); and one Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS), MV Pacific Celebes which has been carrying high-quality scientific equipment (January 2008 to March 2012).",

    "description": "This dataset represents fine-scale floristic vegetation mapping within eastern freehold lands of the Nambucca Local Government Area (LGA) and targeted mapping of Threatened Ecological Communities (TEC) outside public lands throughout the LGA. Vegetation has been classified into Plant community types (PCT), classes and formations, with the composition of respective vegetation species identified. Mapping was conducted by vegetation mapping ‘experts’ (NSW Office of Environment and Heritage) between 2013 and 2015, and was based on 3-D PLANAR modelling, aerial photography interpretation and field floristic assessment. Additionally, basic disturbance information is captured along with a selection of prominent weeds where identified by interpreters.\nVegetation mapping and a field verification program were conducted, in two stages, for parts of the Nambucca Shire Council Local Government Area (Nambucca LGA) using high-resolution digital aerial imagery. The aim of the project was to map the vegetation and plant community types in the coastal and lowland areas of the Nambucca LGA outside National Park and State Forest Estate in order to: • Define the extent of vegetation on the valley floors, to provide a refined and accurate layer of woody and non-woody vegetation cover for private land and coastal Crown Land within the Nambucca LGA. • Delineate the potential occurrence of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) on freehold lands and coastal Crown Land in the Nambucca LGA (Stage 1). • Map all coastal and lowland vegetation communities on freehold land and coastal Crown Land (Stage 2). • Identify areas of the Stage 2 mapped vegetation to be used in habitat modelling for the Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). The vegetation map is suitable for use at a scale of 1:5000 and will support environmental planning and assessment at the level of local government areas and regions. The map is indicative of the vegetation and threatened ecological communities occurring within an individual property or development land area. However, it is recommended that decision making be based on further flora surveys and expert-driven site assessment to meet the requirements of the TSC Act and other planning instruments on a case-by-case basis.\nVIS_ID 4473",

    "description": "We propose to undertake a pulsar survey along the Galactic Plane using the new Methanol Multibeam receiver in order to uncover pulsars previously selected against in lower frequency surveys. The scientific aims of this survey are\n(a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies, (b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, (c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (e.g. a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and\n(d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies. Simulations have shown that we expect to find a total of 200 pulsars of which about one half will be new detections.",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Lower North Coast catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow. Data accessed from The Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data Portal.\nThis work is funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage project based at Macquarie University with industry partners Landcare Australia and Hunter-Central Rivers Local Land Services. \nThis work is published in two Open Access papers:\n\nAgnew D, Fryirs K (2022) Identifying corridors of river recovery in coastal NSW Australia, for use in river management decision support and prioritisation systems.

    "description": "A land parcel is an area of land with defined boundaries, under unique ownership for specific real property rights. A property is something that is capable of being owned, either in the form of real property (land) or personal property (chattels). The interest can involve physical aspects, such as the use of land, or conceptual rights, such as a right to use the land in the future.\r\nThe cadastre is an up to date parcel based land information system which contains a record of interests in land (i.e. rights, restrictions and responsibilities). The cadastre includes a geometric description of land parcels linked to other records describing the nature of the interests, the ownership or control of those interests, and often the value of the parcel and its improvements. A cadastral product or service visualises the boundaries of land parcels, often buildings on land, the parcel identifier, basic topographic features and sometimes boundary corner monumentation. The land parcel and property theme provides the basic fabric of land ownership. It consists of the national cadastral database and associated parcel and property information.\r\nDescriptive data includes the identifier, tenure, ownership type, size, value, land\r\nuse and legal rights or restrictions associated with each separate land object.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) for women aged 20 to 69, by age group. The NCSP began in 1991. It aims to reduce cervical cancer cases, illness and deaths in Australia. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nParticipation in the NCSP for this report was defined as the percentage of women in the population aged 20-69 who had at least one Pap test in a 2-year period. Participation rates were calculated using the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 20-69 for the relevant 2-year reporting period adjusted for the estimated proportion of women who have had a hysterectomy.\n\n\nA PHN was assigned to women using a postcode to PHN correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nPostcode is used for mailing purposes and may not reflect where a woman resides.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to a PHN and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nThe time period of some PHN data presented is prior to the initiation of PHNs, which were in established in June 2015.\n\n\nSome duplication may occur where the same test is reported to the cervical screening register in two or more jurisdictions. This may lead to erroneous results when focusing on smaller geographical areas. This may affect border areas more than others.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n\nPHN205 Murray includes Albury, NSW.\n\n",

Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/).

Most are in parks and playgrounds while some can also be found along main roads or near tourist attractions. Our water fountains are not only useful, they are something of a tourist attraction in themselves - with some more than 100 years old.   This dataset contains locations of drinking fountains and their accessibility in the City of Sydney.   For more information on drinking fountains, visit the City of Sydney website.",

    "description": "Irrigated agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin: an economic survey of irrigators 2012-13 to 2014-15 presents key farm performance measures for irrigated horticulture, dairy, cotton and rice farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n The first three survey years (2006-07 to 2009-10) were severely affected by drought, with record low inflows to river systems and low irrigation water allocations. Incomes of horticulture, dairy, rice and cotton farms were relatively low throughout this period. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash incomes from 2010-11 onwards were mostly higher than in the first three survey years as seasonal conditions improved and water allocations increased. \r\n\r\n Water trading was an important tool for irrigators to manage low water allocations during severe drought, particularly between 2006-07 and 2008-09. The survey results show the proportion of farms trading water allocations rose from 2006-07 to 2008-09, then declined until 2010-11 as water supplies became more plentiful after the drought ended. ",

    "description": "### _NOTE: This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._ ###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nEach financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including if the information: \r\n\r\n- is commercially sensitive and could cause harm \r\n- is false, confusing or misleading \r\n- is offensive \r\n- could endanger public safety \r\n- falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nIf a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/charity](acnc.gov.au/charity). \r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used to find the AIS information lodged by multiple charities. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. \r\n\r\nThe 2017 AIS collects information about charity finances, and financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. \r\n\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. \r\n\r\nFor more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-public/understanding-charities/financial-information-charity-register-0). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view them. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset was compiled by the Water for Sustainable Hydrogen project from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The spatial causal network comprises a rigorous and comprehensive scientific assessment of potential causal pathways by which hydrogen and renewable energy development can affect environmental assets. The network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "title": "Genetic management of threatened koala populations: Using genotyping-by-sequencing to define meaningful conservation goals",
    "description": "Genetic management is a critical component of threatened species conservation. Understanding spatial patterns of genetic diversity is essential for evaluating the resilience of fragmented populations to accelerating anthropogenic threats. Nowhere is this more relevant than on the Australian continent, which is experiencing an ongoing loss of biodiversity that exceeds any other developed nation. However, while threatened species management is generally the purview of state governments, intensive data collection at this scale is often neglected, despite arguably being the most useful for guiding ongoing conservation efforts. Using a proprietary genome complexity reduction-based method, we generated a data set of high-quality Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate spatial patterns and indices of genetic diversity in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), a highly specialised folivorous marsupial that is experiencing rapid and widespread population declines across much of its former range. Genotyping of 314 individual koalas sourced from across the state of New South Wales was performed using the Diversity Arrays Technology platform (DArTseq™) with funding provided by the NSW Government under the New South Wales Koala Strategy (Grant Agreement No. KR_2019_01). \nOur findings demonstrate that current management divisions across the state of NSW do not fully represent the distribution of genetic diversity among extant koala populations, and that care must be taken to ensure that translocation paradigms based on these frameworks do not inadvertently restrict gene flow between populations and regions that were historically interconnected. We also recommend that koala populations should be prioritised for conservation action based on the scale and severity of the threatening processes that they are currently faced with, rather than placing too much emphasis on their perceived value (e.g., as reservoirs of potentially adaptive alleles), as our data indicate that existing genetic variation in koalas is primarily partitioned amongst individual animals. As such, the extirpation of koalas from any part of their range represents a potentially critical reduction of genetic diversity for this iconic Australian species.",

    "description": "The objectives of the work in SE Queensland (Nov. 2011) was to revisit dive sites inside and outside of a green zone offshore of Moreton Island.  There were a few issues associated with working on a small vessel and on the final day of operations the AUV was lost in part due to the vessel not having sufficient fuel to stay on station when the vehicle did not surface on the completion of its dive.  An extensive search was conducted over the following three days using Coast Guard vessels and aerial search but the AUV was not located.  Two weeks later the vehicle washed ashore some 100km to the North of the site where it was last seen.  It had sustained relatively little damage but this incident highlights the vulnerability of the Facility to the loss of its one asset.  An ARC LIEF proposal has been submitted to support the development of multiple, smaller AUVs to help maintain the AUV Facility observing program",

    "description": "This data was collected in May 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2012_T02.\n\nDeparted: \tBrisbane, QLD, May 02, 2012\nArrived:   \tLautoka, Fiji, May 09, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. Effective environmental impact assessment (EIA) relies on rigorous scientific assessment of all potential causal pathways by which large-scale developments may impact on valued assets in a region. Despite their importance to decision-making, many EIAs are flawed by incomplete analysis of causal pathways, limited spatial assessment and a lack of transparency about how risks have been evaluated across the region. To address these, we developed an EIA methodology based on network analysis of potential causal pathways in a given region. This network approach is coupled with a systematic evaluation of the likelihood, consequence and mitigation options for each causal pathway from one or more human activities to multiple valued assets. The method includes analysis of the confidence in these evaluations, recognizing where knowledge gaps constrain assessments of risks to particular assets. The causal network approach is complemented by a spatially explicit analysis of the region that allows residual risk (i.e. risk remaining after all feasible mitigations) to be mapped for all valued assets. This identifies which activities could lead to potential impacts of varying concern (rated from ‘very low’ to ‘potentially high’), their likely pathways, which valued assets are at risk and where these residual risks are greatest. The output maps reveal ‘risk hotspots’ where more detailed local-scale assessments and monitoring should focus. This dataset contains the spreadsheets describing the causal network for the Cooper GBA region and the spatial grids evaluating likelihood, consequence and mitigation. The dataset also contains a spreadsheet summarising the results and all output grids with the level of concern.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset has the input spreadsheet describing the nodes and links in the Cooper causal network (COO_input.xlsx) and the spreadsheet summarizing the results of the spatial causal network analysis (COO_output.xlsx). The dataset also contains all the grids associated with the link evaluations (grids/input) as geotiff files. The filename corresponds to the entries in the gridname column in the input spreadsheet. The dataset also contains the output grids as geotiff files. These are stored in the directory grids/outputs, organised in a directory per endpoint. Each of these directories contains: 1. a png file of the subnetwork of links leading to that endpoint, 2. the overall impact grid (geotiff), 3. a heatmap of number of processes of concern for each endpoint (geotiff) and three subdirectories (activity, stressor, process) of the impact grids of the causal pathways that contain the activity, stressor or process.",

    "description": "The Ecosystem Diversity component of the LTIM Project catalogued the different ecosystem types in the Basin that received Commonwealth environmental water annually and cumulatively over the five-year duration of the project (2014-15 to 2018-19). The evaluation was conducted at a whole-of-basin scale to assess the extent to which water-dependent ecosystem types were supported by Commonwealth environmental water and the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to Basin Plan biodiversity objectives. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project examined the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and assisted the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives. \r\n\r\nEcosystem types in the Basin are defined using the interim Australian National Aquatic Ecosystems (ANAE) Classification Framework. The ANAE Classification Framework was applied to the best available jurisdictional mapping for Basin wetlands, floodplains and rivers by Brooks et al. (2014)  to produce the interim Murray-Darling Basin Aquatic Ecosystem Classification data set. Ecosystem types that received Commonwealth environmental water were identified by intersecting the ANAE mapping with the annual Commonwealth environmental water inundation and LTIM valleys spatial layer. The evaluation was updated retrospectively to include improvements to the ANAE mapping that were published during the LTIM Project.  The final data sets include these updates.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Ecosystem Diversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We thank them for their knowledge and science and respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "After nearly three years of monitoring, comprising with the Parkes telescope and the FAST telescopes, FRB 20220529 is proven to be an extremely interesting repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential ~200-day RM period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare has been observed in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate the paleo sea-ice record for marine sediment core SO136-111. We applied a generalized additive model, and compared the estimates from GAM with those estimates derived from weighted averaging partial least squares, the Imbrie and Kipp Transfer function and the Modern Analogue Technique.\nWe provide the first record of paleo winter sea-ice concentration data for core SO136-111, based on a diatom proxy. Core SO136-111 provides a record for winter sea-ice concentrations over the last 220 kyr BP.\n\nGravity core SO136-111 (56°40'S, 160°14'E, water depth 3912 m) was retrieved from the Emerald Basin, in the East Indian sector of the Southern Ocean south of the modern Antarctic Polar Front. The core was retrieved in 1998 during the TASQWA cruise on board the FS SONNE.",

    "description": "Traditional pulsar searching techniques are not sensitive enough to extreme pulsars such as millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in compact binaries (e.g., Pulsar-Blackhole binary systems), extremely fast spinning pulsars (e.g., sub-MSPs), and high dispersion measure (DM) pulsars. Such a situation is now changed thanks to the development of next generation radio telescope arrays such as Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). ASKAP is capable of conducting highly sensitive radio continuum surveys with wide sky coverage (e.g, Evolutionary Map of The Universe survey). One of the solutions is to find pulsar candidates in radio continuum surveys such as ASKAP surveys and then carry out targeted searches. This technique allows us to search over the wide bandwidth with full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. In this proposal, we propose to observe 16 pulsar candidates identified in the Galactic plane using new ASKAP EMU images. We found 22 candidates by selecting sources with spectral index steeper than -2.0 and compactness less than 1.2. Among them 13 are known pulsars and a reasonable number of candidates to follow up (9 sources). In total, we have 16 candidates including seven sources from 2023APRS semester. Because of the dense ionised medium in the Galactic Plane, MSPs are likely to be missed by previous pulsar surveys carried out at 1.4 GHz. Here, we propose a targeted pulsar search with the Parkes UWL which allow us to search pulsation at higher frequencies and therefore avoid strong DM smearing and scattering effects.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "Core MD88-779 was taken during the 1988 French ASPARA IV cruise in the South East Indian Ocean aboard the Marion DuFresne. The core was situated on the South Tasman Rise (47º50.690S, 146º32.750E) at a depth of 2260m. Although the core recovered was 6.7m long, only the top 2.6m were studied as preliminary investigations had indicated that this section covered the last two glacial cycles.\n\nIsotopic analysis was performed on tests of the benthic foraminifera Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi. The record contains two climatic cycles that reach into isotope-stage 7. The benthic isotope curve of core MD88-779, however, shows a melding of isotopic stages 3-5, which are difficult to separate with depth.\n\nThe age-model is derived through comparison with the benthic SPECMAP stack of Martinson et al. (1987). The core covers 200kyr over 260cm, and thus has a low sedimentation rate. It also shows a reduction of sedimentation from the Holocene rates to that of the last glacial (oxygen-isotope stage 2). \n\nThe complete loss of a diatom record at 170cm and 210/220cm in the core is extremely unusual. The diatom signal is interpreted as having been removed by increased water mass velocity, extreme post-depositional silica dissolution or decreased productivity. There is no sedimentological evidence from the core which provides further interpretation.",

    "description": "Modelling of landscape capacity for 75 landscape-managed NSW threatened species. \n\nLandscape capacity is a measure of how usable habitat is for supporting populations based on the quality of habitat and how easily species can move across the landscape to access sufficient resources to support a population. This project maps climate-informed landscape capacity. This mapping shows how well NSW landscapes can support fauna populations into future climate. The location of climate refugia are identified. These are areas that support species populations through time, from pre-industrial times and into the future.\n\nThe methods and descriptions of outputs are provided in the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/persistence-landscapes-project\">project report</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/d44cb0df-0242-4db3-9126-8c26aba7f80a/resource/27c36e75-690e-4fcd-88b4-b89bbdfafeba/download/plp_reportcards_final2025.pdf\">Two page species forecasts</a> summarise results for each species.\n\nEach species model is projected into NARCliM (v1.0) climate futures. The dataset comprises: individual models for 1750, 2000, 2030 and 2070 epochs; 'consensus' maps across 12 climate models for 2070; and multi-species refugia and landscape capacity across time maps (<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/edf6e375-57c5-4f55-93f0-422a0af1900c\">for the 75 threatened species</a>, and also including site-managed species <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/c76d5cd9-b3d1-4622-a4d5-55aed553e38b\">here</a>). \n\nThe individual species geotiff files are grouped into zip files which are large and may take considerable time to download.\n\nThese resources are outputs of the Persistence in the Landscape Project (PLP). \n\nThis item contains a zip file of landscape capacity rasters for the following reptile species, for pre-industrial (1750), 2000, 2030 and 2070, based on NARCliM 1.0 projections:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Aprasia parapulchella</em>, <strong>Pink-tailed Legless Lizard</strong></li>\n<li><em>Brachyurophis fasciolatus</em>, <strong>Narrow-banded Snake</strong></li>\n<li><em>Coeranoscincus reticulatus</em>, <strong>Three-toed Snake-tooth Skink</strong></li>\n<li><em>Delma impar</em>, <strong>Striped Legless Lizard</strong></li>\n<li><em>Harrisoniascincus zia</em>, <strong>Rainforest Cool-skink</strong></li>\n<li><em>Hoplocephalus bitorquatus</em>, <strong>Pale-headed Snake</strong></li>\n<li><em>Hoplocephalus stephensii</em>, <strong>Stephens' Banded Snake</strong></li>\n<li><em>Silvascincus tryoni</em>, <strong>Tryon's Skink</strong></li>\n<li><em>Varanus rosenbergi</em>, <strong>Rosenberg's Goanna</strong></li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who gave birth and smoked during pregnancy. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers who smoked during pregnancy, and the denominator as the total number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers with a stated smoking status.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid.\n\n\nA woman's smoking status during pregnancy is self-reported.\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a stated smoking  status for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

They include areas of sediment supply (sources), sediment loss (sinks), and the sediment transport processes linking them (pathways). Sediment transport pathways include both alongshore and cross-shore processes, and therefore cells are best represented in two-dimensions.

    "description": "The South-East Queensland 200m mooring (IMOS platform code SEQ200) is part of the East Australian Current (EAC) array. It was initially deployed on the 25/03/2012 at (27.34 S, 153.77 E). The site depth is 200m.\n\nObservations of currents, temperature, and conductivity are measured.\n\nIn conjunction with the SEQ400 mooring and the North Stradbroke Island National Reference Station (NRS NSI), this mooring forms the inshore component of the the EAC mooring array. The East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200m or more. \n\nManagement of this mooring is undertaken by staff from the National Reference Station (North Stradbroke and Maria Island).",
