The data provides a revision of existing vegetation mapping with scored sensitivity values for a range of criteria, used to derive a sensitivity index. This will aid in the determination of areas that may be suitable for World Heritage listing throughout the Cessnock Local Government Area.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW Government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n* Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.

    "description": "Historically, low-lying land adjacent to rivers and coastlines has been favoured for settlement as they provided sources of fresh water, food, transportation and waste disposal. These areas become affected by flooding during sufficiently heavy or prolonged rainfall, high tides or storm surges and cyclones. In the north-west of the State flooding is most likely to be caused by the summer monsoon or tropical cyclones while floods in the south-west are more likely to occur in response to heavy winter rainfalls.\n\nWhile historical flood records and information extend as far back as 1830, detailed information on peak flood levels is typically limited to the last few decades.\n\nThis dataset shows the extent of flooding (polylines) that has occurred during major flood events in Western Australia.\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the historical flood mapping, 3 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Historical Flood Levels (m AHD)\nFPM Historical Extent of Flooding\nFPM Historical Floodplain Area\n\nThe major flood events that are covered in this dataset are:\n\nBow Bridge Townsite (June 1988)\nCorrigin Townsite (January 1982)\nEsperance Townsite (January 2007)\nKupungarri to Willare (including Dales Yard &amp; Mount Joseph gauging stations) - Fitzroy River (January 2023) \nLake Grace Townsite (January 2006)\nMerredin Townsite (February 1979)\nPerth (February 2017)\nTambellup Townsite (January 1982)\nWarmun Aboriginal Community (March 2011)\nYork Townsite (July 2021, August 2022)\n\nOther major flood events that have occurred in the past include:\n\nBlackwood River (1945, 1955, 1963, 1964, 1982)\nCollie River (1945, 1963, 1964, 1974, 1982)\nFitzroy River (1983, 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002, 2011)\nGascoyne River (1960, 1961, 1980, 1995, 2000, 2010)\nGreenough River (1888, 1927, 1953, 1971, 1988, 1999, 2006)\nMoore River (1934, 1955, 1961, 1995, 1999)\nMurray River (1862, 1945, 1955, 1964)\nPreston River (1964, 1967, 1974, 1983, 1990, 2011)\nSwan River (1862, 1872, 1945, 1955, 1964, 1983)\n\nThe historical flood information is used in the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation's floodplain management activities to ensure that floodplains are managed for the benefit of the whole community, minimising the risk and damages and protecting environmental values.\n\nFloodplain mapping datasets and floodplain development strategies for rivers and major watercourses in Western Australia are also available from the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation.\n\nGLOSSARY:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "Transit lanes can be used by vehicles containing a certain number of people. Public buses and minibuses, taxis, hire cars with HC number plates, motorcycles and bicycles, as well as emergency, special purpose and breakdown vehicles, can also use transit lanes, regardless of the number of people in their vehicles.\nTransit lanes can only be used during the times and days specified on the sign when there are two or more people in a vehicle, including the driver. If there are less than the required number of people in the vehicle, a transit lane can only be entered for a maximum of 100m to:  \n* Enter or leave the road  \n* Overtake another vehicle turning right or making a U-turn  \n* Enter a lane from the side of the road.\nPlease be advised this data is valid as at 2008. Also it demarcates the location of where the transit lanes are stamped on the road, not necessarily of the extent of the lanes themselves.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Cumberland Plain flux station is located in a dry sclerophyll forest. The Cumberland Plain Woodland is now an endangered ecological community that encompasses distinct groupings of plants growing on clayey soils. The canopy is dominated by <em>Eucalyptus moluccana</em> and <em>Eucalyptus fibrosa</em>, which host an expanding population of mistletoe. Average canopy height is 23&nbsp;m, the elevation of the site is 20&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 800&nbsp;mm. \nFluxes of water vapour, carbon dioxide and heat are quantified with the open-path eddy flux technique from a 30&nbsp;m tall mast. Additional measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave and longwave radiation and net, diffuse and direct radiation and the photochemical reflectance index. In addition, profiles of humidity and CO2 are measured at eight levels within the canopy, as well as measurements of soil moisture content, soil heat fluxes, soil temperature, and 10&nbsp;hr fuel moisture dynamics. In addition, regular monitoring of understory species abundance, mistletoe infection, leaf area index and litterfall are also performed.",

The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially.   The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes.  The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS.  The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field.  AMS is also set up to be used by other Department Planning, Industry &amp; Environment groups eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\n\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hazards, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point.\nDetailed documentation is available including:\n-  Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets)\n-  Data Model\n-  Business Rules\n-  Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed.  Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

    "description": "This data set shows the occupancy and size of spectacled flying-fox camps across the distribution of the spectacled flying-fox in the Wet Tropics Region.  Camp locations are also provided.  Data was collected monthly and all camps in the region were monitored each month.\r\n\r\nThis data was collected to provide information on the dynamics in abundance and distribution of the spectacled flying-fox.  It is part of a long term monitoring program that has been running since 2004. For further information see the publicaton:\r\nTait, J., Perotto-Baldivieso, H. L., McKeown, A., & Westcott, D. A. (2014). Are Flying-Foxes Coming to Town? Urbanisation of the Spectacled Flying-Fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) in Australia. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109810\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a subset of the complete time series corresponding to the collection period of the NERP TE program, from June 2011 - Oct 2014.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nMonthly surveys were conducted as daytime ground counts and followed the methodology outlined for the National Flying-fox Monitoring Program (Westcott et al. 2011; http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/391f5fed-e287-4dd3-85ac-640037926ef5/files/310112-monitoring-methodology.pdf).  Surveys were conducted by a single surveyor.  All camps were surveyed over a 2-3 day period.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nThis data covers the ¿counted¿ population only.  An unknown and variable proportion of the population roost in unknown locations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data is provided as a 28 kb Excel file with camp names, latitude and longitude of camp location and columns for each survey month.  Camps are never dropped from the survey so blanks represent camps with no spectacled flying-foxes present during the survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nWestcott D. A. & McKeown A.

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Canberra) with SA2 code (81113).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Canberra East SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for cthe selected SA2 area. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2018 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "Bush Fire Prone Land is mapped within a local government area, which becomes the trigger for planning for bush fire protection. Bush Fire Prone Land mapping is intended to designate areas of the State that are considered to be higher bush fire risk for development control purposes. Not being designated bush fire prone is not a guarantee that losses from bush fires will not occur. The NSW Bush Fire Prone Land dataset is a map prepared in accordance with the Guide for Bush Fire Prone Land Mapping (BFPL Mapping Guide) and certified by the Commissioner of NSW RFS under purposes of Section 10.3 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 No 203. \nOver time there has been various releases of the BFPL Mapping Guide, in which the categories and types of vegetation included in the BFPL map have changed. The version of the guide under which, each polygon or LGA was certified is contained in the data. \nBFPL is an area of land that can support a bush fire or is likely to be subject to bush fire attack, as designated on a bush fire prone land map. The definition of bushfire vegetation categories under guideline version 5b: * Vegetation Category 1 consists of: &gt; Areas of forest, woodlands, heaths (tall and short), forested wetlands and timber plantations. * Vegetation Category 2 consists of: &gt;Rainforests. &gt;Lower risk vegetation parcels. These vegetation parcels represent a lower bush fire risk to surrounding development and consist of: - Remnant vegetation; - Land with ongoing land management practices that actively reduces bush fire risk. * Vegetation Category 3 consists of: &gt; Grasslands, freshwater wetlands, semi-arid woodlands, alpine complex and arid shrublands. * Buffers are created based on the bushfire vegetation, with buffering distance being 100 metres for vegetation category 1 and 30 metres for vegetation category 2 and 3. \nVegetation excluded from the bushfire vegetation categories include isolated areas of vegetation less than one hectare, managed lands and some agricultural lands. Please refer to BFPL Mapping Guide for a full list of exclusions.\nThe legislative context of this dataset is as follows: On 1 August 2002, the Rural Fires and Environmental Assessment Legislation Amendment Act 2002 (Amendment Act) came into effect. The Act amended both the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and the Rural Fire Services Act 1997 to ensure that people, property and the environment are more fully protected against the dangers that may arise from bushfires. Councils are required to map bushfire prone land within their local government area, which becomes the trigger for the consideration of bushfire protection measures when developing land. BFPL Mapping Guidelines are available from www.rfs.nsw.gov.au\nhttp://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/4412/Guideline-for-Councils-to-Bushfire-Prone-Area-Land-Mapping.pdf",

The voyage took place from 11-22 November 2021 departing from Hobart (TAS) and returning to Hobart (TAS).\nThe Kongsberg SBP120 (sub bottom profiler) was used to acquire data containing the specular reflections at different sediment interfaces below the seafloor. The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP120 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\nData are stored in .raw ( 1332 files 7.99GB) raw and .seg (XX files XX GB) segy formats at CSIRO.\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "A detailed study of flood behaviour of the Macquarie River at\nDubbo has been undertaken.\n\nThe peak discharge for the 100 years event was estimated taking into account the behaviour of Burrendong Dam and a joint flood frequency study with flows from the Bell River. Flood levels, flood velocities and the floodway limits were determined for the 100 year event using the HEC-2 water surface profile computer program.\n\nA preliminary assessment of flood damages in Dubbo showed that the average annual damages are in the order of $137,000. Under 100 years flood conditions approximately 15 residential properties and 47 commercial properties would be inundated by floodwaters up to 2.9m deep.\n\nThe presence an operation of Burrendong Dam has been assessed as significantly reducing the impact of flooding at Dubbo. Additional structural mitigation measures have not been recommended.\n\nNon structural  methods in particular flood warning and flood awareness strategies and development controls are considered to be appropriate measures for Dubbo.\n\nFor verification of the hydraulic model and the monitoring of future floods, it is recommended that a system of peak flood level indicators be installed. It is also recommended that for floods that exceed 9m on the Pump Station gauge additional peak flood levels be obtained throughout the study.\nobtatned .thrgMflput t2w .ud",

The dataset comprises of a digital point coverage of glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each marine incursion sediment sample is represented as a point which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles within the  Windmill Islands.",

The results are presented as a mean, minimum and maximum result of the NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) ensemble (representing 10 Global Climate Model results) for each gridded point, as well as a standard deviation to reveal the statistical range between model results.\n\nRelative change files (difference between the future and baseline prediction) are also available for each of the calculations i.e. annual and seasonal mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum. \nThe data is bias corrected, and users are encouraged to read the CSI technical fact sheet for further information on this, and data limitations. It also includes background information on the project and datasets, explanations of technical terms such as Global Climate Models (GCMs), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and further information about the projections. It also contains important advice regarding using the data appropriately. \n\nFuture updates to this dataset may include regional and global climate model specific data at a 4-kilometre resolution, as well as a third ‘middle of the road’ scenario (SSP2-4.5).\n\nThe data naming protocol is outlined in the technical information factsheet available under Data and Resources.\n\n•   Frequently asked questions - https://www.wa.gov.au/service/environment/environment-information-services/climate-science-initiative-frequently-asked-questions\n\n•   Climate Science Initiative - https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-water-and-environmental-regulation/climate-science-initiative",

This point feature dataset is part of the NSW Features of interest Category. Court house data points are positioned within the cadastral parcel in which they are located.Gaol - A facility for the confinement or safe custody of criminals and others committed by law. This point feature dataset is part of the NSW Features of interest Category. Gaol data points are positioned within the cadastral parcel in which they are located.These features do not fit within one of the ten foundation spatial data themes and are therefore classified as a category.

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "description": "Part of the Vicmap Admin dataset series. This layer contains polygon features delineating the current Country Fire Authority Region Boundaries.\nIn 2010, CFA moved to align their administrative boundaries to the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries. As a result of this direction, from 1st July 2010, what was once known as CFA Areas will now be known as CFA Regions.\nThere are three exceptions in this dataset. In June 2011, Bass Coast Shire became part of Southern Metropolitan Region when the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries indicate that it should be part of Gippsland Region. In October 2012, Yarriambiack Shire was divided using the east-west rabbit fence (same as the Total Fire Ban District Boundary) which impacts on the Loddon Mallee and Grampians Regions boundary. In August 2013, the gazetted boundary prior to the mapping changes made as part of the Boundary Alignment Project at Inverloch Brigade, were reinstated impacting on the boundary ajoining Southern Metropolitan and Gippsland Regions.\nOn the 2nd October 2014, CFA's eight Regions became five. This involved the merger of Hume and Eastern Metropolitan Regions to form North East Region, and Loddon Mallee and Northern &amp; Western Metropolitan Regions to form North West Region. The other Regions were also renamed. These changes were a part of the Creating our Future Together (COFT) Program.",

    "description": "Permanency is defined as the capacity for carbon to be preserved and not reworked under conditions of higher hydrodynamic energy associated with storms and changes to tidal regimes. The permanency of carbon within substrates has been questioned (DeLaune and White, 2012; Kirwan and Mudd, 2012), particularly in the context of increased storminess. This component does not specifically indicate retreat pathways for coastal ecosystems as they respond to sea-level rise. Lower elevations on estuarine shorelines may be exposed to greater hydrodynamic energy due to fetch and wave-action, whilst coastal barrier sediments are more exposed to high wave energy of the open ocean; the exposure of these sediments to higher hydrodynamic energy increases the probability of reworking and poses considerable risk to carbon permanency. \nDeLaune, R., and White, J.

Forty-eight individuals were marked in the October observation period and 100 individuals were marked during the May period. The movements of individuals were followed over 4 intervals that corresponded to conditions of high tide/daylight, low tide/night, high tide/night, low tide/daylight. A Perspex quadrat marked in a grid pattern in 1 cm or 2 cm intervals was placed over the study area and used to record the position of each individual. \n\nMean rate of movement in May 1977 (2.70 ± 0.59 cm/h) was greater than during October 1976 (1.11 ± 0.22 cm/h). At low tide, the rate of movement correlated with air temperatures, with lower movement rates at higher temperatures. At high tide, there was no variation in movement.",

    "title": "Macquarie Park Floodplain Risk Management Study & Plan",
    "description": "In accordance with NSW Government policy, the Council of the City of Ryde is committed to\npreparing a Floodplain Risk Management Plan for Macquarie Park. This report documents the\nfirst stage of the process of preparing the Plan – that is, the preparation of a flood study report.\n\nThe study area consists of a portion of the Lane Cove River floodplain and those City of Ryde\nareas which drain in a northeasterly or easterly direction to it. Much of the 1,558ha study area\nis developed. It is crossed by a number of major roads including Epping Road, Lane Cove\nRoad and the M2 Motorway and the underground Epping to Chatswood railway line.\n\nThe consultants drew on both previous flood study reports and additional community\nconsultation to review historical records about flood problems that have been experienced in the\ncatchment and this process found that the two most widely reported floods were in November\n1984 and February 1990.\n\nComputer-based (DRAINS) hydrologic models and (TUFLOW) hydraulic models have been\ndeveloped. While substantial efforts have been made to compile as best a picture as possible\nof several relatively recent floods (i.e. November 1984 and February 1990), the resultant rainfall\nand water level data sets were found to provide only very general information about the floods.\n\nAs a consequence, while the models generally reproduce the observed flood regimes, formal\ncalibration against those events was not possible. The modelling confirmed that the November\n1984 event was worse than the February 1990 event and significant number of properties in\nnatural depressions experienced overland flow inundation. Additionally, some properties\nlocated adjacent to open creek channels experienced substantial depths of water.\nDesign flood event modelling followed and this report presents the results of modelling the\n20 year average recurrence interval (ARI) flood, the 100 year ARI flood and the Probable\nMaximum flood (PMF).\n\nThe detailed DRAINS and TUFLOW models provide a sound platform for the further flood\nmodelling tasks that will be undertaken during preparation of the Floodplain Risk Management\nStudy and Plan.\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nThe DRAINS software (Reference 7) has principally been used to model the hydrologic regime\nof the study area. It is a comprehensive hydrologic modelling program for designing and\nanalysing various types of catchments and urban stormwater drainage systems and includes\nhydraulic modelling capabilities for pipes and overland flowpaths. The software is widely used\nin Australia and Council itself has used DRAINS for many years.\nThe DRAINS model version is 2009.06.\n\nWhile it follows that DRAINS software is suitable for undertaking both hydraulic and hydrologic\nassessments of urban catchments – and both capabilities have been used in this study – it is\nimportant to note that the pipe hydraulic analysis undertaken within the subsequent hydraulic\nmodelling phase (refer Chapter 4) provides a more comprehensive picture of both pipe and\noverland flow rates.\n\nThe widely used and Australian developed TUFLOW software (Reference 6) was chosen as\nthe hydraulic modelling tool for use in the study because of its capability to simulate flood flows\nalong both open watercourses and potentially complicated networks of overland flowpaths such\nas occurs in the study area.\n\nThe technical description of the TUFLOW model and its specific application to the study area is\nprovided in Appendix C. The TUFLOW build model is 2008-08-AF- ISP.\nThe following sections of the report describe the establishment and operation of the TUFLOW\nmodel to simulate:\n<ul>\n<li>the November 1984 and February 1990 events using DRAINS-derived flows. The\nsimulated flood levels and extents for this event were then compared with the historical\ninformation; and</li>\n<li>the design 5 year, 20 year, 50 year, 100 year ARI and PMF events.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.",

    "description": "This data was collected in June 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T02.\n\nDeparted: \tAuckland, NZ,   June 06, 2011\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS,   June 14, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. New sinkhole and waterhole data for the Beetaloo GBA region, interpreted as part of GBA from remote sensing information. It includes locations and descriptions of dams, sinkholes, waterholes, circular clay filled depressions and ephemeral wetlands in the region. Waterholes and sinkholes are particularly prevalent in western Beetaloo GBA region. The sinkholes, waterholes and wetlands often appear to occur in clusters, and can be associated with depressions that can be over 1000m across. Some features may also occur adjacent to large palaeo-valleys, or in abandoned stream channels. Others seem to align with geological lineaments. Some sinkholes appear to be quite recent and contain little vegetation, whereas others are older and contain thick stands of trees.  It is likely than many of sinkholes and depressions are forms of pesudo-karst that have formed in deeply weathered regolith on the Carpentaria Basin. Where the Carpentaria Basin is thin there is potential for sinkholes and conduits to intersect with limestone karst (sinkholes and conduits) that occur in the Cambrian Limestone Aquifer.  \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nPoints were manually interpreted from remote sensing data. Underlying datasets used to help with interpretation and targeting areas of interest include: Remote sensing images for Beetaloo GBA region - regolith ratios and barest earth (Available at: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/0e84fa22-f397-489c-b99a-6492bf010613) and Digital Earth Australia Waterbodies (Available at: https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/132814).  The following columns are included in the dataset 1. Type - these are Dams, Waterholes (naturally occurring features), sinkholes, Ephemeral wetlands and depression. 2. Description - includes information on feature shape, vegetation etc., 3. Dimension, an estimate of longest dimension (in metres) 4. Name- whether the locality has a name. 5. Water - whether the feature is wet, damp or dry. 6 Source. data used to identify the feature. These include DEA (digital earth Australia polygons, RS (remote sensing regolith images), Imagery (aerial photography) or NT got (rangelands waterholes and sinkholes). Latitude and Longitude",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.7) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nTi Tree East site was established in July 2012 and is managed by the University of Technology Sydney. Pine Hill Station is a functioning cattle station that has been in operation for longer than 50 years. However, the east side has not been stocked in over three years. The site is a mosaic of the primary semi-arid biomes of central Australia: grassy mulga woodland and <em>Corymbia/Triodia</em> savanna.The woodland is characterised by a mulga (<em>Acacia aneura</em>) canopy, which is 4.85&nbsp;m tall on average. The soil is red sand overlying an 8&nbsp;m deep water table. Elevation of the site is 553&nbsp;m above sea level, and the terrain is flat. Mean annual precipitation at the nearby (30&nbsp;km to the south) Bureau of Meteorology station is 305.9&nbsp;mm but ranges between 100&nbsp;mm in 2009 to 750&nbsp;mm in 2010. Predominant wind directions are from the southeast and east. \n\nThe instrument mast is 10&nbsp;m tall. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon are measured using the open-path eddy covariance technique at 9.81&nbsp;m. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature and humidity (9.81&nbsp;m), windspeed and wind direction (8.28&nbsp;m), downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation (9.9&nbsp;m). Precipitation is monitored in the savanna (2.5&nbsp;m). Supplementary measurements within and below the canopy include barometric pressure (2&nbsp;m). Below ground soil measurements are made beneath Triodia, mulga and grassy understorey and include ground heat flux (0.08&nbsp;m), soil temperature (0.02&nbsp;m - 0.06&nbsp;m) and soil moisture (0 - 0.1&nbsp;m, 0.1 - 0.3&nbsp;m, 0.6 - 0.8&nbsp;m and 1.0 - 1.2&nbsp;m).",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, April 05, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, April 07, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

Recorded Approvals</li>\r\n<li> 6. Notations</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n##Ipswich Planning Scheme\r\n\r\nThe 2006 Consolidated Ipswich Planning Scheme covers the entire local government area. In most instances it includes roads and watercourses. The Planning Scheme was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the repealed Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) and the Department of Local Government and Planning guidelines and scheme template.\r\n\r\nCouncil adopted the Consolidated Planning Scheme (including all amendments to the 2004 Ipswich Planning Scheme) on 14 December 2005, and took effect (ie commencement date) on 23 January 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme divides the Ipswich Local Government Area into 8 localities-\r\n\r\nUrban Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nCity Centre\r\n\r\n\r\nRegionally Significant Business Enterprise and Industry Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nAmberley\r\n\r\n\r\nRosewood\r\n\r\n\r\nTownship Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nRural Areas, and\r\n\r\n\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach locality is further divided into Zones and in some cases, Sub Areas and Precincts. The planning scheme also provides a secondary organisational layer called Overlays, which are based on special attributes of land that need to be protected, or that may constrain development. There are two types of overlays - character places overlays and development constraints overlays.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme uses the concepts of Overall Outcomes, Specific Outcomes, Probable Solutions and Acceptable Solutions for a zone, overlay or code.\r\n\r\nOverall Outcomes are essentially the overall purpose or intent statements. Specific Outcomes are the more detailed performance objectives.\r\n\r\nProbable Solutions represent one way of achieving a specific outcome and may be either increased or decreased by the Local Government depending on the individual circumstances of the proposal.\r\n\r\nAcceptable Solutions apply only to self-assessable development and represent a precise measure for compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the zoning of a property, it is also imperative to refer to the overlay maps and associated overlay codes (see Part 11) in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development compared to the underlying zone, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nAlso, in addition to the overlays affecting a property, it is also imperative to refer to the zoning maps and associated zone codes in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nData made available under CC-BY-ND terms.\r\nData updated on changes to Scheme.",

    "title": "IMOS - ACORN - Capricorn Bunker Group HF ocean radar site (Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia)",
    "description": "The Capricorn Bunker Group site is in the southern region  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park World Heritage Area (GBR).  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  This is an area where the East Australian Current (EAC) meanders as it moves south from the Swain Reefs and loses touch with the western land boundary.  The area is dynamic with warm EAC water recirculating and being wind-driven northwards along the coast inside the GBR lagoon.  The recirculating warm water contrasts with the upwelling tendency of the parts of the EAC which continue to move southwards.  The CBG radar is ideally placed to follow filaments of different water types and to investigate their impacts on coral reefs and fisheries.  \n\nApplications of the CBG radar data are in the frequency and location of regional upwelling that fuels productivity, and in the connectivity between reefs and islands.  At the central point of the CBG area of coverage is the  Heron Island Research Station which hosts many coral reef and ecology research programs.  The data will also be useful for validation of the operational Bluelink model, and the embedded higher resolution Whole-of-Reef model.   \n\nThe CBG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element receive arrays located at Tannum Sands (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) and Lady Elliot Island (-24.111 S, 152.713 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe capital funding for this system was provided originally as an ARC LEIF Grant, assisted by contributions from James Cook University, The University of Queensland, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in April 2017.",

This return is the basis of\nthe data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\nfor its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APR ceased\nthe RFC data collection after September 2010.\n\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on\nInternational Financial Statistics (see\nhttp://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International\nbanking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the\nBIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\n\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\n\nAll banks operating in Australia complete ARF 231. Between March 2003 and\nSeptember 2010, only those larger RFCs with sizeable overseas assets and/or\nliabilities completed RRF 231. Bank and RFC positions are reported in\nAustralian dollars (AUD). Non-AUD denominated positions have been converted to\nAUD using an appropriate end-quarter exchange rate, so changes in reported\ndata between quarters are due not only to changes in positions but also\nvaluation gains or losses due to exchange rate changes.\n\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the\nrole of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international\ncapital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country\nrisk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are reported\nin this statistical table.\n\nThe data in this statistical table summarise the country exposures of\nAustralian-owned banks (and selected RFCs between March 2003 and September\n2010). This is a smaller reporting pool than the series reported in\nstatistical table B11.2, which is based on all banks and RFCs reporting\nARF/RRF 231 data. The types of assets included here are consistent with those\nreported in statistical tables B11.1, B11.2 and B12.1, except that the data\nare consolidated for Australian-owned reporting entities (i.e. includes the\nclaims on countries of all the offices worldwide of entities with head offices\nin Australia, but excludes positions between different offices of the same\ngroup). Consolidated data only include positions with non-residents (in any\ncurrency).\n\nData are shown for a selected group of countries that account for the bulk of\nthe total. Similar data for other countries are also available in statistical\ntables B13.1.1 and B13.1.2.\n\nData presented in this statistical table are immediate risk claims (expressed\nby the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis), which cover exposures on\nan immediate counterparty location basis. Ultimate risk claims are presented\nin a complementary statistical table B13.2, which cover immediate exposures\nadjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the location of\nthe ultimate counterparty/risk.\n\nIn the maturity distribution, the shortest maturity bracket includes deposits\nthat are repayable on demand, overdue items and overdrafts.\n\naInternational claimsa represent cross-border claims in all currencies and\nforeign officesa local claims in non-local currencies (which would include,\nfor example, USD claims on New Zealand residents by the New Zealand\nsubsidiary of an Australian-owned bank). Also shown are the local currency\nclaims on local residents by the foreign offices of reporting entities (for\nexample, the New Zealand dollar (NZD) claims on New Zealand residents by the\nNew Zealand subsidiary of an Australian-owned bank). These local currency\nclaims are added to international claims to produce foreign claims.\n\nInternational organisations are included in the aPublic sectora category in\nthe consolidated data (while in the locational data they can be reported as\neither bank or non-bank depending on the particular organisation). Official\nmonetary authorities (central banks or similar national and international\nbodies, such as the BIS) are also included in the public sector in the\nconsolidated data (but are treated as banks in the locational data, B12.1 and\nB12.2). Publicly-owned entities (other than banks) are classed in the aNon-\nbank private sectora in the consolidated data (and as non-banks in the\nlocational data).\n\nThe aNet risk transfera is mainly due to risk transfers into and out of\nAustralia and typically does not sum to zero. In several cases, risk is\ntransferred out of the countries listed and into Australia hence becoming, in\neffect, domestic exposures (and reducing foreign claims on an ultimate risk\nbasis). Similarly, the risk associated with what were initially domestic\nexposures has in several cases been transferred, via guarantees and other risk\ntransfers, to other countries (thereby increasing foreign claims on an\nultimate risk basis). The total risk transfer amount is not comparable to the\nrisk transfer amount reported for Australia in the data series of statistical\ntable B11.2 as the former covers only Australian-owned entities while the\nlatter is for all reporting entities.\n\nDerivatives are not included in international claims or foreign claims.\n\n",
