Strategic agricultural land is highly productive land that has both unique natural resource characteristics (such as soil and water resources) as well as socio-economic value (such as high productivity, infrastructure availability and access to markets). Biophysical strategic agricultural land is land with a rare combination of natural resources highly suitable for agriculture. These lands intrinsically have the best quality landforms, soil and water resources which are naturally capable of sustaining high levels of productivity and require minimal management practices to maintain this high quality. Purpose is to identify Strategic Agricultural Land (SAL) within the state.\n This dataset has been capatured and mapped at a regional scale Criteria for Biophysical Strategic Agricultural Land that falls under soil fertility classes 'high' or 'moderately high' under the Draft Inherent General Fertility of NSW (OEH), and land capability classes I, II or III under the Land and Soil Capability Mapping of NSW (OEH), and reliable water of suitable quality, characterised by having rainfall of 350mm or more per annum (9 out of 10 years);\n or properties within 150m of a regulated river, or unregulated rivers where there are flows for at least 95% of the time (ie the 95th percentile flow of each month of the year is greater than zero) or 5th order and higher rivers;\n or groundwater aquifers (excluding miscellaneous alluvial aquifers, also known as small storage aquifers) which have a yield rate greater than 5L/s and total dissolved solids of less than 1,500mg/L.",

Over time, the ACLD will continue to grow as records from each new Census are linked which will further enhance its longitudinal view. The ACLD will also be augmented in the future to take account of migration and births that occur between Censuses.",

It combines population size and geographic remoteness to guide health workforce planning, especially in rural and remote communities. MMM is based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) and is updated after each national Census conducted by the ABS.\r\n\r\nStatistical Area Level 3 (SA3)\r\n\r\nSA3s are regional areas used in the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Formed by grouping SA2s with similar characteristics, they provide a standard framework for analysing ABS data at the regional level, including Census outputs. Australia has 359 SA3s, including codes for non-geographically defined populations. SA3s are used to support regional planning and policy development, and they aggregate to form SA4s.",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the West Gippsland CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the West Gippsland Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n Rapidly changing operating environments of government and their stakeholders threaten to outdate existing policy practices. Policymakers will need to adopt fresh ways of thinking, develop new skills and access innovative ideas. This will affect government policy making on issues affecting agriculture, fishing, forestry, water and rural communities more broadly. This report brings together a set of innovative ideas that collectively offer new thinking, new skills and new tools for policymakers both in the department and elsewhere. Innovation in policy and regulatory practice will help us continue to deliver outcomes for Australian agriculture and the community. The report reinforces the department's commitment to innovation as a core capability for the future. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The report comprises a wide range of findings resulting from a global scan of online and expert sources. The analysis reflects on issues - such as governance, risk and capability - that might affect the adoption of innovations within a government setting. \r\n\r\n Report findings are classified into three emergent themes that are interdependent in nature: \r\n• Thinking in new ways is critical to improving policy practice. Innovative thinking considers knowledge to be socially created, rather than a set of hard, incontestable facts. \r\n• New skills in contemporary and innovative practices can increase the range and depth of existing public sector capabilities \r\n• New tools for policymakers can improve the overall policy process and provide innovative policy instruments for specific policy problems. \r\n Innovation in government differs from private sector innovation, because these sectors vary considerably in their approach to risk, public accountability and managing success.

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women giving birth for the first time who gave birth by non-instrumental vaginal birth, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of selected females giving birth for the first time who gave birth by non-instrumental vaginal birth, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nA non-instrumental vaginal birth is one in which the baby is born through the vagina without the assistance of instruments (vacuum or forceps).\n\n\nNon-instrumental vaginal births include spontaneous vaginal and vaginal breech.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer mortality statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 6 top cancer groupings (colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin and pancreas) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a PHN. The number of people who could not be assigned a PHN is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in October and November 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R0.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, October 31, 2010\nArrivec:  Hobart Australia, November 7, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This data was collected in January/February 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1011_VMS.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, \t    \tJanuary 04, 2011\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, \t\tFebruary 07, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "Raster layer delineates the level of uncertainty depending on the data spatial mix (whether it contains mosaics or is Pure).\nGeneral Background: The National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) has been developed over the last 15 years from a variety of data sources. The commonwealth is reliant on states and territories to supply vegetation data, which is then collated into the NVIS. Because of varying levels of resources available to different regions, the data they are able to supply is of varying scale, age, origin and spatial mix. \nNVIS is widely used by various organisation including, researchers, NGO and governments, for a wide range of uses such as modelling, fire fuel loads and policy. To improve the interpretation of the NVIS dataset the Dept of the Environment & Energy has developed a suite of uncertainty layers and tools to facilitate the robust use of the NVIS.\nAim: to develop a raster Uncertainty layer that is intended to better describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS extant theme dataset.\nOutput: raster files scaled 0-1 that can be used for uncertainty, including data age, origin, scale and spatial mix. The layers can be added together to form one uncertainty layer. Python script/tools will also be provided so individuals can develop their own uncertainty layers and to be as transparent as possible.\nThe Uncertainty layers comprise 5 rasters, 1 composite and 5 individual layers:\n                 -      NVIS Uncertainty layer (composite of 4 below layers)\n                 -      Age: age of the NVIS data\n                 -      Origin: where the data came from\n                 -      Spatial mix: if the data is a mosaic\n                 -      Scale: scale that the data was mapped\nAge, scale, origin and spatial mix Information is supplied by the states and territories as part of the NVIS resupply process.\nThis dataset represents a scale of uncertainty in relation to data spatial mix. Scale categories are below.\nTable 1.

    "description": "Measurements of ice velocity on the surface of the ice sheet in Wilkes Land East Antarctica were made along the routes of oversnow traverses operating out of Casey (66.6 S 110 E).  In general, measurements were made at a nominal spacing of 50 km.  Additional measurements were made at closer spacing in some areas in order to resolve finer scale variation in the flow pattern.  Three main routes were covered: two routes (east at latitude 69 S and west at latitude 68.5 S) approximately followed the line of the 2000 m elevation contour, and a third route headed south from summit of Law Dome ice cap along the line to Vostok station.\n\nAll velocity data were derived from positions determined using Doppler Satellite Positioning techniques with data collected from the (US) NAVSAT systems using JMR receivers, with the doppler data processed in combination with Precise Ephemeris data supplied by the (US) DMAHTC and the DOPPLR software packages.  Processing of the data were carried out by the Australian Division of National Mapping.\n\nThe time interval between first and last position observations was three years for the western route, six years for the southern route, and three to five years for the eastern route.\n\nThese data form part of the data collected for ASAC projects 458 (Characteristics, Dynamics and Mass Budget of the Ice Sheet in Wilkes Land) and 2224 (Glacier dynamics and mass discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet, 45 degrees -160 degrees E) - (ASAC_458, ASAC_2224).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nsite_id (identifier code for the measurement station)\n\nlatitude\n\nlongitude\n\nspeed (speed of ice velocity, units unknown)\n\nazimuth (direction of ice velocity, in degrees. 0=northwards movement, 90=eastwards movement)\n\nThe printouts from the recording and reduction of the doppler observations have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nAll logbooks have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nCopies of the document details forms for the logbooks are available for download from the provided URL.",

    "description": "Raster layer delineates the level of uncertainty depending on the data age. \nGeneral Background: The National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) has been developed over the last 15 years from a variety of data sources. The commonwealth is reliant on states and territories to supply vegetation data, which is then collated into the NVIS. Because of varying levels of resources available to different regions, the data they are able to supply is of varying scale, age, origin and spatial mix. \nNVIS is widely used by various organisation including, researchers, NGO and governments, for a wide range of uses such as modelling, fire fuel loads and policy. To improve the interpretation of the NVIS dataset the Dept of the Environment & Energy has developed a suite of uncertainty layers and tools to facilitate the robust use of the NVIS.\nAim: to develop a raster Uncertainty layer that is intended to better describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS extant theme dataset.\nOutput: raster files scaled 0-1 that can be used for uncertainty, including data age, origin, scale and spatial mix. The layers can be added together to form one uncertainty layer. Python script/tools will also be provided so individuals can develop their own uncertainty layers and to be as transparent as possible.\nThe Uncertainty layers comprise 5 rasters, 1 composite and 5 individual layers:\n                 -      NVIS Uncertainty layer (composite of 4 below layers)\n                 -      Age: age of the NVIS data\n                 -      Origin: where the data came from\n                 -      Spatial mix: if the data is a mosaic\n                 -      Scale: scale that the data was mapped\nAge, scale, origin and spatial mix Information is supplied by the states and territories as part of the NVIS resupply process.\nThis dataset represents a scale of uncertainty in relation to data age. Scale categories are below.\nTable 1.

    "description": "This report presents detailed financial performance of slaughter lamb producing farms in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 and discusses productivity in a historical context. The report was commissioned by Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and expands on results that were published in  Agricultural Commodities (March quarter 2015)  and the  Australian farm survey results 2012-13 to 2014-15  report released in March 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Most farms producing lambs for slaughter are mixed enterprises, deriving receipts from cropping, beef cattle, sheep and wool and from the sale of slaughter lambs. \r\n• Farm cash income of specialist slaughter lamb producing farms, those farms most reliant on lamb production, is estimated to have increased from an average of $80 900 a farm in 2013-14 to $98 300 a farm in 2014-15. This increase was mainly a result of higher prices for lambs and sheep. \r\n• Farm cash incomes and business profit of all slaughter lamb producers are estimated to have fallen in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14. Reduced grain production in 2014-15 is estimated to have resulted in lower average total receipts of slaughter lamb producing farms despite an increase in sheep and lamb receipts mainly a result of increased prices. Average farm cash income of slaughter lamb producers is estimated to have declined by 8 per cent from an average of $180 100 a farm in 2013-14 to $166 000 a farm in 2014-15, in real terms. \r\n• Farm debt of slaughter lamb producing farms averaged $649 577 a farm in 2013-14, slightly more than that in 2012-13 ($641 400). Farm debt is estimated to have reduced in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 as a result of loan repayment and reductions in new borrowings. \r\n• Asset values and new investment remain high for slaughter lamb producing farms and while debt is also high, equity ratios and debt servicing are in line with long-term averages. \r\n",

    "description": "Vectorized version of the Land Monitor Salinity Extent – South West of Western Australia 1998 dataset.\n\nSalinity mapped in raster format with 25-m pixels. The Land Monitor salinity mapping process uses satellite imagery, high-resolution topographic data, ground information and ancillary GIS data sets to map areas of severely salt-affected land identified in consecutive satellite (Landsat TM) scenes (Furby et al 2010). To update the 1990 and 1998 estimates, the spatial-temporal methodology was re-applied using the same approach but took advantage of the latest data and improved computational resources (Caccetta et al 2022). Any changes in the extent of salt affected land detected by Land Monitor in the updated salinity mapping are most likely within the severe salinity class and may represent either expansions of this class of salinity or improvements in the condition of severely salt affected land or in the reduction of commission errors (compared to the original mapping).\n\nThis data has converted the salt effected areas to a vector geodatabase. Additional post processing to remove urban areas has been applied.",

    "description": "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal:- https://portal.aodn.org.au. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledgment all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "This data was collected in may and june 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS072008.\n\nDeparted: \tNoumea, New Caledonia, April 30, 2008\nArrived:  \tSuva, Fiji, June 6, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.5ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. The travel time and warming in the two lines is very similar. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Forests of Australia (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\n*Forests of Australia (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, \r\n including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as \"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to\r\nstate and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2016), also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2016), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map\r\nas forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "An ArcGIS shapefile layer showing the extent of all extant and relic Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies on Shirley Island, Windmill Islands, February 2006. The field Status describes each polygon as extant, relic or maximum. Extant refers to the area used by breeding birds in the summer 2005/06. Maximum refers to the historic maximal extent of the colony. Relic refers to any colony which was not occupied by any breeding pairs during 2005/06.\r\n\r\nPositional accuracy is approx. 1-2 m, after accounting for dGPS errors and errors in identification of the boundaries of colonies. Mapping was conducted after the end of the breeding season, so boundaries were identified as the extent of nest pebbles/fresh faeces, and it was considered that they could be reliably identified to within 0.5m.\r\n\r\nData were acquired using a Trimble Pro XH differential GPS. This work was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\r\n\r\nWork on this project also utilised a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) created for Shirley Island.  See the metadata record, 'A digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto of Shirley Island, Windmill Islands, Antarctica' for more information (linked below).",

It provides a unique opportunity for researchers and policy makers to examine pathways and transitions of population groups, such as unemployed individuals transition into the labour force. Over time, the ACLD will continue to grow as records from each new Census are linked which will further enhance its longitudinal view. The ACLD will also be augmented in the future to take account of migration and births that occur between Censuses.",

    "description": "Dissolved oxygen in the water column is a primary input into the calculation of metabolism and respiration (refer Metabolism BASE Model dataset). Data loggers are deployed at multiple locations in the rivers of each of the Flow-MER Area-scale project to measure continuously at 10 minute intervals:\r\n* Light\r\n* Water temperature\r\n* Dissolve oxygen\r\n* Atmospheric pressure\r\n\r\nThe data record aims to be continuous over the summer water management period, however there are breaks in the data record due to high water levels preventing data retrieval and equipment losses.  There is generally at least one data logger deployed near locations where fish are also sampled.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\nReferences to the metabolism methods using these oxygen data:\r\nGrace MR, Giling DP, Hladyz S, Caron V, Thompson RM, Mac Nally R (2015) Fast processing of diel oxygen curves: estimating stream metabolism with BASE (BAyesian Single-station Estimation).

    "description": "The exposure of Great Barrier Reef coral reef and seagrass ecosystems to contaminants is estimated from the synthesis of: river discharge, water quality data sampled in inshore sites during flood conditions and the use of remote sensing technology to estimate flood plume extents and duration. \n\nRiver discharge: \nDaily mean, maximum and minimum river discharge (Megaliters/day) from 36 rivers, plus their quality control code (as in the DERM web page ¿Department of the Environment and Resource Management, Qld Government, http://watermonitoring.derm.qld.gov.au/host.htm) dated from 1915 (Barron River at Kuranda) up to current date. Rivers current in the data base are: Barron River at Kuranda, Calliope River at Castlehope, Mossman River at Mossman, Waterpark Creek at Byfield, Fitzroy River at The Gap, Kolan River at Springfield, Sandy Creek at Homebush, North Johnstone River at Tung Oil, Endeavour River at Flaggy, Daintree River at Bairds, O'Connell River at Caping Siding, Haughton River at Powerline, Murray River at Upper Murray, Mulgrave River at Peets Bridge, Tully River at Euramo, Baffle Creek at Mimdale, Black River at Bruce Highway, Carmila Creek At Carmila, Ross River at Ross River Dam Headwater, South Johnstone River at Upstream Central Mill, Burdekin River at Clare, Pioneer River at Mirani Weir Tailwater, Russell River at Bucklands, Mary River at Home Park, Barron River at Myola, Herbert River at Ingham, Don River at Reeves, Burrum River at Lenthalls Dam Release, Annan River at Beesbike, Proserpine River at Proserpine, Boyne River at Milton, Burnett River at Figtree Creek, Rocky Dam Ck, O'Connell River at Stafford's Crossing, Normanby River at Kalpower Crossing, and Pioneer River at Dumbleton Weir T/W.\n\nWater Quality: \nNear-shore water quality data has been measured from direct water mainly sampled at the surface, since 1991 as part of the Water Quality Monitoring Plan for the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Sometimes stratified samples using Niskin bottle has been also carried out.  Water samples are analyzed for: TSS (mg/l), chl-a (µg/l), phaeo-a (µg/l), cdom (440), Si (µM), DIP (µM), DOP (µM), TDP (µM), PP (µM), TP (µM), NO2 (µM), NO3 (µM), NOX (µM), NH4 (µM), DIN (µM), DON (µM), TDN (µM), PN (µM), TN (µM), POC (µM), DOC (µM), and the pesticides Ametryn, Atrazine, Bromacil, Desethyl-A, Desisoprop, Diuron, Fluometuro, Hexazinone, Imidaclopr, Metolachlo, Prometryn, Simazine, Tebuthiuro, and Terbutryn. Water temperature, salinity, light and dissolved oxygen are also determined using a Sea-Bird profiler. Each sample is identified in the water quality table by its name, latitude, longitude, sampling time and date. All sample analyses are carried out by the ACTFR laboratory, except for pesticides, which are processed at University of Queensland. The Sea-Bird profiles are treated before inclusion into the data base, and outliers are masked.\nRemote sensing: \nThe data base has an inventory of ~3000 MODIS imagery, including Aqua and Terra sensors. Because the main focus of our team research is to understand the influence of river plumes on the Great Barrier Reef, a more comprehensive temporal coverage covers the period form January to April from 2003 to 2011 (mainly MODIS Aqua imagery). The processed images were done up to level-2 and the main products extracted are CDOM as adg_443, nLw_667, bbq_555_qaa (both used as a proxy for turbidity) and chlorophyll as chl_gsm. True color images are also available for most of the images that have been processed.",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes parts of the suburbs of Revesby\nHeights, Revesby, Panania and Picnic Point. It is an urban catchment that drains in a south-easterly\ndirection through a stormwater pipe network to the Georges River. The Morris Gully catchment is\nwholly within the southern section of Bankstown City Council (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study have been incorporated into a GIS\ndatabase. This allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved\nas required. Information in the database includes data for some 300 stormwater pits and 390\nstormwater drainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Morris Gully Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for a 1 year period between November 1989 and October 1990 inclusive. Individual measurements have been converted so that the yearly trend of wind speed and direction can be seen. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The heaviest 18O value was recorded during MIS 12 (at a depth of 1265cm) with a value of -0.04ppt, while the lightest 18O value of -2.49ppt was registered at 1200cm depth, during MIS 11. Once the estimated ice volume effect has been accounted for, this still leaves a substantial difference 18O which must be accounted for through significant changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) or salinity. The 13C record ranges from a minimum at approximately 126k yrs BP of -0.05ppt during MIS 5, to a maximum value of 2.11ppt during MIS 10.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sector report is the employee perception survey (EPS). \r\n\r\nThe EPS captures employee views about factors affecting their workplace, such as leadership, communication, work/life balance and performance development. This information helps to understand organisational culture across the public sector and is essential in identifying areas for further consideration and acknowledging good practice. \r\n\r\nThe EPS is typically conducted in each public sector body with more than 20 employees once every five years. Different regional offices for the largest agencies, Department of Health and Department of Education, are surveyed every year. To improve the representativeness of the sample, entities are selected across a range of sizes and portfolios. However, care should be taken in interpreting the EPS results because the sample may not be entirely representative of the broader public sector.\r\n\r\nBetween March and August 2013, all employees in 17 public sector entities were asked to complete the survey (including two regional offices from the Department of Health and one from the Department of Education). The average response rate to the survey was 38%, with 5207 valid responses received.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download:\r\n\r\n1)    EPS 2013.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant employees to access online or in hardcopy\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2013 data.xls – individual responses to the EPS, with a question key and response key. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2013 data.sav – individual responses to the EPS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\nFurther information about the EPS sample and summary results for 2013 are available in the [State of the sector statistical bulletin](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/document/state-sector-statistical-bulletin-2013).\r\n",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis data set supercedes the previous Gloucester groundwater usage estimates data sets created in January 2015.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to estimate each groundwater works/bores with the volumetric entitlement and location of each groundwater bore with respective to the water source area in the Gloucester subregion. An estimation of volumetric extraction is made (in ML) based on the yield values reported in the updated data sets provided by the NSW Office of Water in March 2015. This has  been clipped to the Gloucester subregion. \n\n\n\nA spatial dataset (point shapefile GLO_Bore_extractions.shp) has been derived from this data for report map purposes.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nBore locations in the National Groundwater Information System v1.1 Sept2013 database that were spatially located within the Gloucester subregion boundary were extracted and filed in the BA_SYD/GLO project area.\n\n\n\nGroundwater works with the volumetric entitlement in the Glouster Economic Assets 26032015 database that were spatially located withing the Gloucester subregion boundary were extracted and filed in the BA_SYD/GLO project area.\n\n\n\nBased on the Yield values reported in the Glouster_Economic Assets 26032015 database, groundwater extraction volumes were estimated and filed in the BA_SYD/GLO project area.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Gloucester Groundwater Usage Estimates v20150501.

    "description": "Long-term monitoring of waterbirds in the Coorong and Lower Lakes in South Australia is undertaken by the University of Adelaide and forms part of the annual waterbird census in the Lower Lakes, Coorong and the Murray Mouth (LLCMM) region. Waterbird monitoring in the Coorong commenced in 2000, and it expanded in 2009 to include the Lower Lakes. \r\nThe LLCMM region is a Ramsar-listed wetland of international importance for migratory waterbirds. It is also one of the icon sites under The Living Murray program. The condition of the LLCMM region, and waterbird recruitment and populations, have been identified as targets against which to assess progress towards achieving the objectives of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The waterbird census data and findings form part of the ecological information used for this assessment.\r\nThe 2016-17 monitoring program was funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA). Between 2000 and 2016, the MDBA, South Australia’s Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR), Nature Foundation South Australia, Earthwatch Australia and the University of Adelaide funded the monitoring program in different years.\r\nThe MDBA has made the waterbird databases and related resources publicly available on data.gov.au as part of its commitment to the Australian Government policy on public data and information. The terms and conditions for using the data and related resources from this website can be found at https://www.data.gov.au/about.  \r\n",

    "description": "The Intellectual Property Government Open Data (IPGOD) includes over 100 years of Intellectual Property (IP) rights administered by IP Australia comprising patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder's rights. The data is highly detailed, including information on each aspect of the application process from application through to granting of IP rights. We have published a paper to accompany IPGOD which describes the data and illustrates its use, as well as a technical paper on the firm matching. Links to these papers can be found in the Readme.\r\n\r\nIPGOD 2017 was published on 26 April 2017 with exception of tables x06 which were added on 31 July 2017.\r\n\r\nIP Australia released an updated version on 27 September 2017 with some data quality improvements. Details of these improvements are listed in Data Dictionary.",

    "title": "National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Distribution Map Series",
    "description": "The National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series were derived from the NISB\r\nHabitat Map created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the\r\nDepartment of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It\r\nsupports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the\r\navailable mapping data that show the distribution of habitats that occur between the\r\napproximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of\r\nthe outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour).\r\nThis area is broadly equivalent to the “inner” and “mid-shelf” regions identified by\r\nGeoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM\r\nNational Habitat Map Series.\r\nThe habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated\r\nhabitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as\r\ndefined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support\r\nthe development of marine ‘ecoregions’ or bioregional subregions. Details of the\r\nscheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal\r\nBenthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton,\r\n2007).\r\nThe 10 km and 50 km tiles distribution maps that form the National ECM Key Habitat\r\nDistribution Map Series were derived from the NISB Habitat Map in order to produce\r\nmaps at resolutions that are easy to interpret at state and national extents. For each state,\r\ntwo layers were produced, one with 10 km and one with 50 km tiles. In each layer, new\r\nfields were created listing the presence, absence, unknown distribution or nonapplicability\r\nof the Habitats of Interest (HOI). The HOI are rock substrate (Class 1.2),\r\nunconsolidated substrates (Class 2.0), coral habitat (classes 1.1 and 1.2.2.3), sediment\r\ndominated habitats (Class 2.0.1), seagrass dominated habitats (Classes 1.2.2.4 and\r\n2.0.2.1), mangrove dominated habitats (Class 2.0.2.2) and saltmarsh dominated habitats\r\n(Class 2.0.2.3).\r\nThere are technical geographic and cartographic issues that arise when comparing\r\nmapped data sets of multiple scales, as is the case for this compiled and derived data\r\nset. The two derived information products were generated to provide a simplified\r\nspatial representation of the broad distribution patterns of each of the key habitats\r\nNational ECM Habitat Map Series User Guide_v7.doc 30/04/2008 Page 32 of 156 \r\nacross large areas. These derived products are designed to enable the visualisation of\r\nthe habitat distributions at the regional and national extents. It is extremely important\r\nto note that they are definitely NOT able to be used to calculate areas of habitat\r\ntypes.",

Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Darwin City SA2 by AURIN.",

As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 ‘stops’ and two ‘trips’. \n\nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are daily smokers. A current daily smoker was defined as a person who smokes one or more cigarettes, roll-your-own cigarettes, cigars or pipes at least once a day. Chewing tobacco, electronic cigarettes (and similar) and the smoking of non-tobacco products were excluded. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN102 and PHN107, should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates have a relative standard error of 25% to 50% and should be used with caution.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "The Final Divisions layer is the spatial representation of the recommendation of the Local Government Change Commission during the 2023 review of divided Local Government Areas. Divisional boundaries were realigned to ensure, as best as possible, that each division contains 'a reasonable proportion of electors' (the quota) at the upcoming 2024 quadrennial local government elections. Final divisional boundaries were created with input from the general public obtained through public submissions during public consultation of the review. Final divisional boundaries were created by aggregating Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygons while satisfying the requirement for divisions to have 'a reasonable proportion of electors' now, and at the 2024 elections, and taking into consideration features such as transport infrastructure, natural features, and cadastral and suburb boundaries. Final divisional boundaries were aligned to significant, named features where possible. Where practicable, the Change Commission sought to reunite previously split localities and SA1s, to create administrative and operational efficiencies in electoral roll administration. Final divisions were populated with current and projected elector counts (on 9 March 2023 and 31 March 2028 respectively), as well as percent elector deviation from the average elector count at each date. Revised divisional boundaries will come into effect upon the conclusion of the 16th of March 2024 local government elections. Current and projected elector data was obtained from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the Queensland Government Statistician s Office (QGSO) respectively.",

Modelled on the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report [In]Sight was developed in collaboration with Deloitte Access Economics and combines data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Social Health Atlas of Australia.\nBoth employment rates and the levels of labour force participation are key inputs into the creation of an efficient labour market. Generally long-term unemployment indicates the presence of inherent structural problems which may adversely impact competitiveness. Low labour force participation may reflect low education levels in the region a lack of economic opportunities or an atypical age structure (such as a skew towards retirement age persons).",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS102008.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, New South Wales, October 10, 2008\nArrived:  \tNewcastle, New South Wales, October 20, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.5ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. The travel time and warming in the two lines is very similar. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system.

The first leg was to map and visually survey (video) the upper continental slope (and at selected sites transects from the outer shelf to the mid-slope) at regular intervals of 1 deg latitude; the second leg was to targeted sample the surveyed locations to document the benthic biodiversity. Sediment samples were divided into two samples: an elutrition sample for macroinvertebrates that was sent to Robin Wilson at MV for analysis and a sediment sample to be analysed by Geoscience Australia.",

    "description": "Part of VMPROP, PROPERTY_VIEW_DVP is an Aspatial table. \n\nIt is created by comparing the polygons in the PROPERTY_VIEW table with the polygons in the DISPLAY_VIEW_POLYGON table. It holds a record for each PFI in the PROPERTY_VIEW table, and the DISPLAY column has a value indicating whether the polygon is Inside, Outside, or Both (partly inside and partly outside) a DISPLAY_VIEW_POLYGON polygon.\n\nThis table provides a way of limiting the display of property_view polygons so maps can be drawn efficiently.  Polygons with a DISPLAY value of I (inside) can be drawn at larger scales (eg 1:5000), while those with O (outside) can be drawn at smaller scales (eg. 1:50,000). This means rural areas can be displayed at a suitable scale, without the burden of displaying polygons in a town. A DISPLAY value of B (both) is used for some polygons, which can be drawn at both scales. These can be rivers, or multi-part polygons with parts inside and outside the DVP. \n\nTo use this flag for drawing a join is needed - property_view.pfi = property_view_dvp.property_view_pfi",

    "title": "The effects of copper antifouling paints and marinas on the ecology of marine sessile epifaunal assemblages",
    "description": "This thesis has used a field based approach to assess the effects of copper liberated from antifouling paints on sessile epifaunal (or fouling) assemblages in southeastern Australia. In the field the effects of dosed copper may be influenced by site conditions, or because the organism has developed tolerance to exposure.   To explore these possible effects experiments were conducted inside and outside of two enclosed marinas.  Marinas were located at St Kilda (Port Phillip Bay) and Hastings (Western Port Bay), Victoria. At St Kilda,  sites were located inside the St Kilda Marina and at St Kilda Pier.  At Hastings, sites were located inside Westernport Marina and at Hastings Jetty.  Additional sites were also sampled occasionally over the study period. Studies were carried out between  1997-1999.  A novel copper dosing system was developed for use in the field. \n\nStudies comparing epifaunal assemblages inside and outside the two marinas found that marinas produced different assemblages.  The marinas exerted common effects on some functional groups, but effects at the species level differed at each marina.\n \nThe effects of dosed copper inside and outside the two marinas were tested on:  i) the early recruitment of assemblages, and ii) the growth rate and competitive ability of colonial fouling organisms.  Results were characterised by high spatial and temporal variability.  Copper dose affected a number of species recruiting to the plates but was rarely found to significantly alter growth rates of the colonial organisms; this may be attributed to the high variability observed in growth rates.  The competitive ability of colonies was not found to be affected by copper dose or marinas, but few experiments examined this aspect.  \n\nReciprocal transplants of settlement plates between sites and copper doses showed that the effect of marinas on assemblages was more important than dosed copper, even though dose levels were well above background concentrations. This is probably due to a large number of factors associated with marinas over and above the effects of increased background heavy metal pollution.  Several taxa appeared to adapt to local conditions or copper dose and some appeared to show heterogeneity in response to copper dosing or an ability to acclimate to dose.  These types of findings have important implications for the manner in which we apply the findings of traditional laboratory-based ecotoxicology experiments to environmental management.",

This process aims to address the geological factors likely to assist in identifying whether a viable petroleum play is likely to be present, and makes no attempt to factor economics, politics, or social factors into the assessment.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis data set contains image files pertaining to chance of success prospectivity assessment for the Beetaloo Sub-basin. This was undertaken in Stage 2 of the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program and described in Hall LS, Wang L, Bailey A, Orr M, Owens R, Lech M, Skeers N and Woods M (2020) Petroleum prospectivity for the Beetaloo Sub-basin. Technical appendix for the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program: Stage 2. Department of the Environment and Energy, Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and Geoscience Australia, Australia.\r\n\r\nAll files use the Map Grid of Australia (MGA) projection (zone 53) and the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (GDA94). Datasets were generated using Petrosys software in Geoscience Australia.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth by caesarean section and had a general anaesthetic, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth by caesarean section and had a general anaesthetic, divided by the number of females who gave birth by caesarean section and recorded a non-missing value for general anaesthetic, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nCaesarean section is an operative procedure to remove the baby through an incision through the female's abdomen and uterus.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who gave birth through the vagina.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nData were not available for Victoria in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \n\nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

It aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from bowel cancer by actively recruiting and screening the eligible target population for early detection or prevention of the disease. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of people invited to screen through the NBCSP during the relevant 2-year period, who returned a completed screening test within that period or by 30 June of the following year. The number of individuals invited to screen excludes those who deferred or opted out without completing their screening test.\n\n\nPHN areas were assigned to NBCSP invitees using an SA1 to PHN correspondence. Those invitees without reliable SA1 details were mapped with a postcode to PHN correspondence instead, which may lead to some minor inaccuracies in results.\n\n\nSome invitee SA1 codes and postcodes cannot be attributed to a PHN. These invitees were included in an 'Unknown' group where applicable.\n\n\nSome postcodes cross PHN boundaries, leading to slight inaccuracies.\n\n\nThe time period of some PHN data presented is prior to the initiation of PHNs, which were in established in June 2015.\n\n\nBiennial screening for those aged 50-74 is not fully rolled out. During the time period reported, the specific ages invited within the 50-74 age range included 50, 54, 55, 58, 60, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72 and 74.\n\n\nThese results calculate participation rates using the new NBCSP performance indicator specifications. This indicator now measures a 2-year invitation period and also excludes those who opted off or suspended participation. Therefore, these results cannot be compared to rates reported prior to 2014.\n\n\nNBCSP participation rates per area are not related to bowel cancer incidence rates.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016, and the 2016-2017 period covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017.\n\n\nThe number of people in different PHNs may not sum to 'Australia' total due to rounding.\n\n\nPHN205 Murray includes Albury, NSW.\n\n",

Thousands of tests are run and these measurements are used to calculate average speeds achieved and other metrics for different volunteer groups, such as volunteers on the NBN fixed-line services and volunteers on NBN fixed wireless services. The summary data released includes test results for all Whiteboxes used in MBA Report 22 for download, upload, latency and outages metrics. The results are de-identified to protect the privacy of the volunteers and the integrity of the MBA program.",

    "description": "This dataset contains the experimental data underpinning the development and field testing of the larval seedbox, a modular and passive delivery system designed to scale coral reef restoration. Data include larval culturing, seedbox deployments, and coral settlement surveys conducted at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef in November 2024. The seedboxes facilitated the delayed release of ~14 million competent coral larvae across ~2 hectares of degraded reef, with settlement quantified on 234 tiles placed around seedboxes and at reference sites. The collection documents larval densities, settlement rates, and spatial modelling of dispersal, providing evidence that the larval seedbox significantly enhances settlement compared to natural background levels. These data support the first empirical demonstration of unrestrained, broad-scale coral larval seeding as a practical restoration tool.",

    "title": "DSS - Quarterly Payment Recipients (LGA) June 2017",
    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2017. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",
