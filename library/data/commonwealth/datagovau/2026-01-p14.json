    "description": "\"This is the fourth 3D data model of Floreat Beach UAV imagery captured on 20th Aug 2019 for the Cambridge Coastcare beach dune modelling and monitoring project. It was created as part of an initiative to innovatively monitor coastal dune erosion and visualize these changes over time for future management and mitigation. \nThis model includes both 3D Point Cloud and 3D Mesh constructed from over 1000 images captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model \nhttps://youtu.be/FpmwXFCcgl8\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh for 20th Aug 2019 \nhttps://skfb.ly/6O9yy \nThe dataset is a dense 3D point cloud (i.e. a 3D set of points): the X,Y,Z position and colour information is stored for each point of the point cloud.\"",

    "description": "In recent years the term 'enhanced greenhouse effect' has become well known in modern society and yet aspects of this possible 'future climate' are poorly understood. The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. The core obtained offshore from Sumatra (BAR9043, 104.0316E, 5.82S) highlights an upwelling signal at 14,000 yrs BP that disrupts the warm stratified water column, which was a feature between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to present. This upwelling is timed to a regional pattern of an intensified Australasian Monsoon.",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe fifth of these six experiments involved the winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), moored in the central part of Jervis Bay (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed.\n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There is only one subsiduary records that directly relates to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \nfef1f3c0-6d9f-11dd-8128-00188b4c0af8",

    "title": "Kelso Stormwater Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is largely located within the Sydney suburb of Panania. The study area\nincludes the entire Kelso Creek catchment, from the stormwater pipe network in the upper\ncatchment to Kelso Creek, which flows through Kelso Park and eventually joins the Georges\nRiver. The lower catchment is provided some protection against flooding from the Georges\nRiver through the Kelso levee. The catchment is wholly within the Bankstown local\ngovernment area.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for some 850 stormwater pits\nand 810 stormwater drainage pipelines. Photos of culverts and other sketches are also\nlinked to the database.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. All pipes, drains and\ncreeks are included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\n\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions. Various sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "description": "The Department measures progress of children and young people as they move from early childhood into their school years, and then into further education and work through the four objectives across this life cycle: achievement, engagement, wellbeing and productivity.\nOn Victorian Student Satisfaction Survey (multiple years), the survey is of students who completed or left training in the previous year. Results have been rearranged to refer to the year of the Survey. Therefore, the 2021 result (latest available) in this dataset is of student training experiences in 2020, based on the 2021 Satisfaction Survey. Due to 2 changes in the survey methodology, the results for this measure cannot be compared over time. In the 2018 Survey (of 2017 experiences), respondents were given an extra response option in one of the relevant questions. In the 2020 Survey (of 2019 experiences), a further change was made to the job-related benefits question to reduce complexity and confusion.\nOn the Engagement Indicators tab, note that for \"Students with a positive opinion about their school providing a stimulating learning environment\", in 2020–21, the results were reported against the wrong year levels (Years 7–10 and Years 11–12, instead of Year 7-9 and Years 10-12). This has been corrected in this Annual Report.\nOn the Wellbeing Indicators tab, note that for \"Students feeling connected to their school\", in 2020–21, the results were reported against the wrong year levels (Years 7–10 and Years 11–12, instead of Year 7-9 and Years 10-12). This has been corrected in this Annual Report.\nAnnual Report published: https://www.vic.gov.au/department-education-annual-reports",

    "description": "We request time to observe 270 pulsars on a regular basis in order to achieve three main science goals. The first is to understand pulsars: how do they spin down and what disrupts this process, how and why their profiles vary with time, whether they precess or have planetary mass companions, in short all the things that make pulsar timing noisier than the perfect clock. Secondly we want to understand the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through repeated monitoring of dispersion measure, rotation measure and flux density variations in conjunction with scintillation parameters. Finally, we provide these data as a community service both to the high-energy community where we have strong collaborative links (particularly to Fermi) and to the radio pulsar astronomers generally through the CSIRO archive. The project is on-going since 2007, we are (co-)authors on 106 papers arising from the P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of students from Bordeaux, Manchester, Oxford, Stanford, and Swinburne. We are seeking long-term project status with a view to continuing the project into the SKA era.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and attended an antenatal visit in the first trimester (less than 14 weeks), by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers for whom gestation at first antenatal visit was 'Not stated' and mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

Aurora Australis collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 30 minutes. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 1-minute averages of the observations are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of environmental observations as well as ship parameters (such as speed and direction). Wind is observed with two different sensors, and the relative (observed) and true (relative to fixed earth) wind speed and direction provided. Air temperature and humidity is observed on the port and starboard of the main mast. Short-wave (sunlight) and long-wave (infra-red radiation or heat, from sky and clouds) is also observed on the port and starboard side.

    "description": "Please note:\nThese reports are provided as a historic archive only and are not current. If you have an ongoing requirement to use the statistics, to meet a legislative or policy requirement, please seek advice from the relevant WA Government Department or Authority rather than contacting the data custodians listed under Key Information. If you use the reports, please include a caveat stating the following: (1) year of currency, (2) a statement that the statistics presented may now be out of date, and (3) the report citation.\nImportant update for the Swan Coastal Plain (October 2025):\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) have updated the remnant vegetation mapping and vegetation association statistics for the Swan Coastal Plain, and they are available on DataWA. Please refer to the Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics available at: \nhttps://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/swan-coastal-plain-and-region-schemes-2024-remnant-vegetation-statistics\nThe Swan Coastal Plain and Region Schemes 2024 Remnant Vegetation Statistics provide status of remnant vegetation for the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion, the Metropolitan, Peel and portion of the Greater Bunbury Region Scheme areas, and local government areas within these regions.\nOverview of the Report:\nFrom 2007 to 2018 DBCA provided regular updates of statistics on the pre-European and current extent of the vegetation associations of Western Australia within IBRA or IBRA sub-regions. The reporting is based on Beards (pre-European) vegetation mapping of systems and associations at 1:250,000. The statistics were used for several purposes including conservation planning, land use planning and when assessing development applications.\nThe statistics provided a general overview of the status of vegetation associations, within IBRA bioregions or sub-regions, noting the limitations detailed in the README document relating to scale, remnant vegetation mapping and currency of the analysis. They were intended to be used in conjunction with other information on the biodiversity values of an area and with input and advice from people familiar with the vegetation association and the vegetation condition of an area of interest.\nIncluded in the report are statistics on the progress towards achieving a conservation reserve system, for WA, that is comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR). The CAR reserve system is based on three principles:\n· Comprehensive - includes the full range of ecological/forest communities recognised at an appropriate scale within and across each bioregion,\n· Adequate – level (extent) of reservation that will ensure viability and integrity of populations, species, and ecological communities, and\n· Representative – those areas reserved should reasonably reflect the biotic diversity of the communities\nThe system of reserves helps conserve our biodiversity. Please contact DBCA for advice on the CAR statistics.\nIn 2011 the name of the report changed from \"CAR Analysis\" to \"Statewide Vegetation Statistics\". The CAR analysis statistics are still included in the report.",

    "description": "The prevalence of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in and around the Galactic center and the bulge has been one of the key questions in pulsar astronomy. In addition to finding more exotic and interesting binary systems at and around the Galactic center and bulge due to the enhanced density of stars/stellar remnants, MSPs are also proposed to be one of the candidates to explain the observed Fermi gamma-ray excess. However, most of the MSPs discovered so far are field (disk) MSPs or those in globular clusters. Initial steps towards addressing the question of Galactic center/bulge MSPs were made with the discovery of the first MSPs in a Galactic filament, but more progress comes from the discovery of a sample of MSPs around the Galactic center. Blind surveys targeting MSPs can suffer from many observational biases that smear the pulses due to binary acceleration, scattering from the enhanced density, and so on, which increases the parameter space for discovery and can sometimes make the problem intractable. However, if pulsar candidates can be identified reliably from imaging surveys, then targeted observations can make the problem tractable in identifying the pulsations. We followed up a sample of polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT bulge imaging survey and discovered a sample of 16 new MSPs. Here we request the timing observations of 8 interesting MSPs (a subset of our discovery sample), to study the binary nature of these sources and their potential inclusion in pulsar timing array efforts.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of boys who were fully immunised against human papillomavirus (HPV). The data spans the financial years 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic boundaries from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHPV is a common sexually transmitted infection. It is estimated that more than four out of five people will have an HPV infection at some point in their lives. Although often asymptomatic, HPV infection can cause a wide range of cancers, including cervical cancer, and other conditions such as genital warts. The Australian Government introduced the school-based National HPV Vaccination Program in 2007 for adolescent girls, and extended it to include boys in January 2013. The data were sourced from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register), which is operated by the Victorian Cytology Service. The HPV Register records information about HPV vaccine doses administered under the National HPV Vaccination Program in Australia. The data reported are for girls and boys aged 15 who had received three doses of HPV vaccine by 30 June 2016 (as at 12 August 2017). The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females and males aged 13 at 30 June 2014 was used for the denominator, as this reflects the eligible population at the time most vaccinations were administered.\n                                                For further information about this dataset, visit the data source:[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - HPV immunisation rates in 2015-16 Data Tables.](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/immunisation/hpv-immunisation-rates-2015-16/data)\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese data include boys aged 15 who had received three doses of HPV vaccine by 30 June 2015 and 2016. Any doses administered after that date are not included and therefore the current coverage in this cohort may be higher than reported here. Only vaccinations reported to the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register) are included.\n\n\nBoys whose courses are considered to be incomplete according to the Chief Medical Officer guidelines and boys who do not wish their details to be recorded on the HPV Register are excluded.\n\n",

Data is for 2010–11 and 2015–16, and the associated change between the two years.\r\n\r\nNon-agricultural land uses are mapped using seven thematic layers, derived from existing datasets provided by states and territories, and external agencies. The seven layers are:\r\n\r\n* protected areas\r\n* topographic features\r\n* land tenure\r\n* forest cover\r\n* catchment-scale land use\r\n* urban boundaries\r\n* stock routes.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural land uses are based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ 2010–11 and 2015–16 agricultural census data; with spatial distributions modelled using MODIS satellite imagery and training data, assisted by spatial constraint layers for cultivation, horticulture, and irrigation.\r\n\r\nLand use is specified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8. The same method is applied to both time points using representative national datasets for each period, where available. All rasters are in GeoTIFF format with geographic coordinates in Geocentric Datum of Australian 1994 (GDA94) and a 0.002197 degree (~250 metre) cell size.\r\n\r\nThe Land use of Australia 2010–11 to 2015–16 data package is a product of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program.",

The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis shapefile shows the extent of the alluvial aquifers (including colluvium) within the Richmond River basin in NSW.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe shapefile is based on the digital 1:250000 surface geological map (see lineage) obtained from the Clarence-Moreton SEEBASE project in NSW. The polygons for the alluvium and colluvium were extracted from the NSW surface geology map sheets in ArcGIS and then combined into a new shapefile.

    "title": "Cost of production - Australian beef cattle and sheep producers 2012-13 to 2014-15",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n This report presents and discusses cost of production estimates for beef cattle and sheep producers for the three years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• The on-farm cost of beef production on a per kilogram live weight basis increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15, as producers increased farm expenditure in 2014-15 in response to the much higher prices received for beef cattle. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, producers pared back expenditure on beef inputs to a minimum in response to low beef cattle prices in an attempt to maintain operating margins (receipts per kilogram less costs of production). \r\n• The largest increase in production costs occurred in northern Australia, where many beef producers were also subject to dry seasonal conditions in 2013-14 and 2014-15. This resulted in increased expenditure on fodder and freight. Overall, the total cost of production increased between 2012-13 and 2014-15 by 33 cents per kilogram live weight in northern Australia and by 25 cents in southern Australia. \r\n• Total costs of production averaged over the three years ending 2014-15 were similar in southern and northern Australia, at 174 cents per kilogram live weight in southern Australia and 175 cents in northern Australia. Northern Australia includes Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley, Pilbara and Murchison-Gascoyne regions of Western Australia. All other regions are included in southern Australia. \r\n• Higher beef cattle prices in 2014-15 resulted in operating margins increasing relative to the very low margins recorded in 2013-14. However, expenditure on farm inputs increased, so operating margins were similar to those recorded in 2012-13. \r\n• The average on-farm cost of sheep production on a per kilogram live weight basis remained largely unchanged between 2012-13 and 2014-15. \r\n• The average cost of production for beef cattle and sheep producers for the period 2012-13 to 2014-15 decreased as production size increased, which indicates that significant economies of size exist in beef and sheep meat production. These economies of size would be an incentive to expand beef and sheep meat production to enhance profitability. \r\n• Economies of size for sheep producers appear to result mainly from larger sheep enterprises using farm capital and labour more efficiently. However, for beef producers, cash operating costs for larger herd size producers were lower than those for smaller producers and they used farm capital and labour more efficiently. \r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "This data represents the raw data captured in the 2015 Anthropometric Survey of the Royal Australian Navy (ASRAN), as well as the data embedded in the Multivariate Virtual Fit Test. The ASRAN data provides 87 measurements, collected digitally and manually on 1322 Permanent Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel (232 females and 1090 males), aged 18–54 years. It can be used for the design and evaluation of vessels, systems, equipment and clothing. This data can be used to conduct multivariate anthropometric analyses and to determine precise levels of fit and accommodation based on the anthropometry. Note that it is always recommended to consider the inclusion of secular change, personal equipment and clothing correction factors, and other allowances that should be considered when using the anthropometric data (comfort, movement, posture etc). \r\n\r\nThe Multivariate Virtual Fit Test has ASRAN data embedded in it, and supports the conduct of multivariate analyses. This tool developed by Prof Matthew Parkinson and Dr Matthew Reed can be used to predict accommodation in clothing, systems or platforms where body dimensions are independent of each other (e.g., how many people have a stature of x and a bideltoid breadth of y). It is very valuable to demonstrate the decreasing accommodation that occurs when using the historical 5th and 95th percentile values across multiple anthropometric dimensions.\r\n",

Regulations require decision-makers to notify the Council of any proposals that may affect a place under consideration for registration.\n\nThe State Register of Heritage Places recognises a place's value and importance to Western Australia. It includes buildings, structures, gardens, cemeteries, landscapes and archaeological sites and has more than 1,300 places listed in it. The State Register is managed by the Heritage Council and provides a place with statutory protection to ensure that any proposed demolition, relocation, subdivision, amalgamation, alteration, addition or new development is in harmony with its cultural heritage values. The State Register continues to expand, as significant places yet to be registered are progressively assessed by the Council.\n\nFor more information contact the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage on (08) 6551 8002 or see https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-planning-lands-and-heritage.",

The emphasis is on inter-annual variations of upper ocean properties and their influence on exchange with the deep ocean.  The time-series provided permit investigation into issues of ocean physics and chemistry, climate change, carbon cycling and biogeochemical controls on marine productivity.  These moorings provide cost-effective observations and overcome the infrequent availability of ships in the region.  \n\nThe SOTS site is located in the sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ), southwest of Tasmania, near 47S, 142E. SOTS observations are made from\n1) a deep ocean sediment trap mooring, used to collect sinking particles to quantify carbon transports.  This mooring also provides current meter measurements and a deep ocean CTD to measure heat contents below the depth of ARGO profiling float measurements.\n2) the Pulse biogeochemistry mooring, used to measure upper ocean carbon cycle and phytoplankton productivity processes included sensor measurements of dissolved gases (O2, N2) and bio-optical properties.  This mooring also collects water samples for measures of dissolved carbon and nutrients, and phytoplankton microscopic identification.\n3) additional biogeochemical sensors (CO2, O2, bio-optical, and bio-acoustic devices) mounted on the nearby Southern Ocean Flux Station air-sea flux mooring (and managed by the Air-Sea Flux Stations sub-facility).",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Hobart in TAS with SA2 code 601051027, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

The sensors take a variety of readings such as salinity, temperature and moisture. The units and readings are included within the data. This dataset can be joined to the soil sensor locations dataset using the site id column. This dataset contains a large number of records, to download only a particular sensor's readings see our attached guide on how to filter data.\nDifferent readings taken (based on unit column):- %VWC: Volumetric water content is a numerical measure of soil moisture. It is simply the ratio of water volume to soil volume.- ºC: Temperature in degrees celsius.- µS/cm: Salinity is the measure of the concentration of dissolved (soluble) salts in water from all sources. (microseimens per centimetre)Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every hour as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.",

    "description": "AUV Sirius (IMOS Platform code: SIRIUS) was part of a three week research cruise in September 2007 aboard the R/V Southern Surveyor documenting drowned shelf edge reefs at multiple sites in four areas along the Great Barrier Reef.  \n\nSirius documented relic reefs up to 20k years old formed during previous ice ages when sea levels were up to 100m lower than today. Broad scale bathymetric mapping was used to confirm if the reefs are consistent geomorphic features and to define patterns of past reef growth. \n\nSites for targeted dredging, sub-bottom profiling and AUV imaging were then selected for detailed study of particular features.  \n\nAll activities were undertaken during a 21-day cruise aboard the R/V Southern Surveyor, Australia's Marine National Facility operated by CSIRO. \n\nThe study of these structures may yield insights regarding potential future sea level changes and their potential impact on sensitive reef areas such as the GBR.",

The model recognises that students and school communities are not all the same and that they have different needs which require different levels of support.\nData Notes:\n\n\nAnticipated Budget for each school subject to actual school enrolments. \n\n\nRAM funding represents the total funding for the four equity loadings and the three base allocation loadings, a total of seven loadings. The equity loadings are socio-economic, Aboriginal background, English language proficiency and low-level adjustment for disability. The base loadings are location, professional learning and per capita. \n\n\nThe RAM funding table provides a sum total of the seven loadings for each NSW public school. \n\n\nEvery school receives a School Budget Allocation Report (SBAR) in October showing the full school funding allocation for the following year. This includes each school's allocations for the seven loadings of the RAM as well as staffing and operational funding. \n\n\nEvery school receives School Budget Allocation Report (SBAR) Adjustments in April/May confirming the full school funding allocation for the current year.\n\n\nChanges in school funding are the result of changes to student needs and/or student enrolments.\n\n\nData is refreshed after each SBAR cycle.\n\n\nFor more information on the RAM, visit  Schools funding.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nStrategic Schools Resourcing.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women giving birth for the first time who gave birth by instrumental vaginal birth, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of selected females giving birth for the first time who gave birth by instrumental vaginal birth, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nAn instrumental birth is a procedure that uses instruments (forceps or vacuum extraction) to assist the baby to come out through the vagina.\n\n\nInstrumental vaginal births include forceps and vacuum extraction.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "IEC2021_ FRINGING _VEG is the spatial representation of fringing vegetation used in the calculation of Index of Estuarine Condition (IEC) scores. In the context of the IEC, 'fringing vegetation' refers to the vegetation which grows above the permanently inundated portion of the estuary but within the zone of influence of the more-or-less saline estuarine waters. It includes vegetation in intertidal areas and riparian areas in the estuary but not subtidal vegetation (see Sinclair and Kohout 2018 for more precise working definitions of vegetation zones). In the field, the extent of the fringing vegetation and any built structures that impinge on it were mapped (by annotating an aerial photograph). Fringing vegetation was mapped according to Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVC) (https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/biodiversity/bioregions-and-evc-benchmarks) and subjectively classified into areas of different condition with reference to vegetation structure, weediness and land use. Each patch of vegetation that could be accessed was scored for its degree of invasion by perennial weeds and its structural resemblance to a relevant benchmark (https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/biodiversity/bioregions-and-evc-benchmarks). Additional observations were recorded on the score sheet, relating to <code>Health of the dominant plant species¿ and</code>Extent of engineered hydrological modifications¿. Scores were estimated for the areas that could not be observed. These estimated scores were based on the areas that were observed. The areas of all relevant polygons were calculated, and a score produced for each metric (IEC Report 2021).",

    "description": "In 1986, the River Murray Riparian Vegetation Survey was initiated by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to assess the present status of the vegetation along the River Murray, to identify causes of degradation, and to develop solutions for its rehabilitation and long term stability.  The Study area was the floodplain of the River Murray and its anabranches, including the Edward-Wakool system, from below Hume Dam to the upper end of Lake Alexandrina, a total of nearly 9,000 square kilometres (900,000 hectares).  The survey was conducted by Margules and Partners Pty Ltd, P and J Smith Ecological Consultants, and the then Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (DCFL).  The results were then compiled by DCFL, a report published (see References) and a GIS was constructed.\nPlease note that the vegetation mapping uses a mixed floristic/structural classification.\nVIS_ID 3964",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2015 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

The mapping was to be completed using Land and Property Information high resolution digital photography. At the time the project was commissioned, aerial photography available for the study area was limited to the LGA-wide 2009 series (used for the 2011 vegetation mapping project). The project commenced in November 2017 using 2009 aerial photography, along with September 2012 imagery limited to the rural villages of Modanville, Dunoon and Nimbin. From May 2018 onwards, the project used high resolution aerial photography taken in April 2018.\nDisclaimer\nThis vegetation mapping is provided on the understanding that Lismore City Council is not responsible for the results of any action on the basis of any information or for any error in or omission from this information.

The Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station began taking samples of the atmosphere over twenty years ago. Since the first sampling began in April 1976, there have been more that 3 billion measurements taken. Among these are measurements of green house gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide as well as chemicals which deplete the ozone layer.  Since the station first began in 1976, a 10% increase in carbon dioxide (one of the main greenhouse gases) has been measured. In addition long term records of aerosol particulates, radon and solar radiation have been obtained. As well as monitoring a wide range of atmospheric trace gases, Cape Grim measures concentrations of natural and anthropogenic particles, and meteorological parameters including wind speed and direction, rainfall, temperature, humidity and air pressure. Sophisticated measurements of solar radiation, including harmful UV-B radiation, are also carried out.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of offences recorded on the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP). Recorded offences include any criminal act or omission by a person or organisation for which a penalty could be imposed by the Victorian legal system. The data spans the years ending September in the period of 2008 to 2017 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe CSA recorded crime collection includes all offences that are reported to, and detected by, Victoria Police and recorded on the LEAP database. The scope and coverage of the data, however, is not representative of all crime that occurs in Victoria. Some crimes may not be recorded on LEAP, not be reported to police, or the responsibility for responding to certain offences may lie with another agency. Recorded offence data are compiled on the basis of the date that the offence was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the offence was detected by, or reported to police. The creation date may not be the date when the offence occurred, or the date when the offence came to the attention of police.\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRecorded crime statistics are based on data extracted by Victoria police on the 18th day after the reference period, and are subject to movement between releases.\n\n\nThe offences in the dataset are grouped according to the CSA offence classification.\n\n\nThe data excludes offences recorded at Justice institutions and immigration facilities, Unincorporated Victoria and where the geographic location is unknown or outside of Victoria.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, sensitive offence counts for subdivisions 'A10 Homicide and related offences' and 'A30 Sexual offences' with a value of 1 to 3 are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n",

Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of Australia. It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).",

Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2015 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

Each grid cell contains the 3 night average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data/product-informa\ntion/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products.  Matchups with buoy SST observations (adjusted to skin depths) indicate typical 2014 biases of &lt; 0.1 degC and standard deviations of 0.5 degC to 0.6 degC for NOAA-18 and NOAA-19.  Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.",

    "title": "AIHW - Health Risk Factors - Adults who are Overweight Crude (%) (PHN) 2011-2015",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who are overweight. Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2007.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

It was first deployed in February 2012, removed in June 2013 and redeployed in May 2014.\n\nThe mooring's instruments measure surface CO2, temperature and salinity.  The hydrochemistry sampling at the National Reference Stations will also provide total alkalinity data, as will future pH sensors on the moorings, allowing for a complete determination of the carbonate system and pH. Current instrumentation: Battele Seaology pCO2 monitor, Aanderaa Oxygen Optode and Sea-bird Electronics, model SBE16plus V2 SEACAT.\n\nThe Acidification Moorings sub-facility is responsible for building an ocean carbon and acidification monitoring network for Australian waters.  These moorings provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.",

    "description": "Bangalay Sand Forest is a threatened ecological community (TEC) associated with coastal sand plains found in the Sydney Basin and South East Corner bioregions. The most common tree species are Eucalyptus botryoides (bangalay) and Banksia integrifolia (coast banksia). The understorey is characterised by a mix of sclerophyll and mesophyll species. \nIn this report, we focus on the distribution of this TEC in the NSW South Coast region, an area that extends from Sydney to the Victorian border. This study assesses whether Bangalay Sand Forest is located within the 350,000 hectares of state forest found in our southern study area.\nOur interpretation of Bangalay Sand Forest (BASF) was informed by the six previously described vegetation communities cited in the final determination that were relevant to the South Coast region. Four are eucalypt-dominated forests and one a coastal scrub dominated by Banksia integrifolia and Leptospermum species. An additional community has a mixed canopy composition for which the final determination includes a qualifying statement to exclude stands dominated by Casuarina glauca.\nInitially we examined existing maps of coastal sand landforms and geology along with available vegetation maps to determine the likely extent of habitats suitable to support the presence of the TEC within state forest. We reviewed candidate areas that were within or proximate to state forests using interpretation of high-resolution digital aerial imagery as a basis for planning field surveys. We identified a small number of areas in Termeil and East Boyd State Forests that were plausible locations for BASF and an additional two areas in Nullica and Mogo State Forests identified from existing vegetation mapping. Sites that had not already been subject to field survey were visited and were either systematically sampled or were rejected on site where the species composition and landform were clearly mapping inaccuracies (e.g. estuarine mudflat)\nOur analyses of plot data assigned 66 plots (out of 8452) to Bangalay Sand Forest, based on allocation to a previously defined community cited in the final determination and agreed substrate qualifiers. We used plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables to develop a Random Forest (RF) presence-absence model of the probability of occurrence of Bangalay Sand Forest across the study area. We used the RF model and the locations of plot data to further assess whether Bangalay Sand Forest occurred on state forest.\nWe found no evidence of Bangalay Sand Forest occurring on any state forest within our study area based on the results of our field surveys, analysis of plot data, review of existing map data and predictive models.

    "description": "This data was collected in March2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022010.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, March 15, 2010\nArrived:  \t Hobart, Australia, March 24, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

This data has been derived primarily from GEODATA TOPO 250K Series 1 and contains the following features: State borders, roads, railways, populated places, rivers and lakes, coastline and islands, bathymetric and land contours, and spot locations.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe key source for production of the Builtup Areas, Drainage, Framework, Localities, Rail Transport, Road Transport and Waterbodies layers was the GEODATA TOPO 250K Series 1 product. Some revision of the Builtup Areas, Road Transport, Rail Transport and Waterbodies layers was carried out using the latest available satelite imagery. The primary source for the Spot Heights, Contours and Offshore layers was the GEODATA TOPO 10M Version 1 product. A further element to the production of GEODATA TOPO 10M 2002 has been the datum shift from the Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66) to the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (GDA94).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2013) GEODATA TOPO 10M 2002.

    "description": "The Victorian Training Market Reports are an on-going series of reports\nproduced by DEECD, with the aim of providing summaries of Victorian Vocational\nEducation and Training (VET) market performance and responsiveness to industry\nneeds. All VET providers who receive funding from the Victorian Government\nreport monthly to the Skills Victoria Training System (SVTS), which accepts\nand validates the providers' training activity data for payment, monitoring,\nreporting and related purposes.  DEECD analyses the providers' reported data\nin its production of the Victorian Training Market Reports.\nThe Reports summarise emerging trends in the Victorian training market and\nprovide a comparative overview of annual market changes.\nKey metrics in the Reports include training delivery by funding source,\nqualification level, training completions, employment status, higher needs\nlearners and region.  The Reports also analyse the responsiveness of training\ndelivery to specific occupational needs, industry and regional profiles.\nAll figures published in the Reports are generally rounded to the nearest 100.\nNB: The Victorian Training Market Reports are published quarterly. The data in\nthe first, second and third quarterly reports is considered preliminary and\nshould be treated as being indicative only.\nAll data supplied to Data VIC refers to activity reported and accepted by the\nSVTS system (data upload) for the Fourth Quarterly Report 2012. This 2012\nannual collection dataset was open for reporting purposes over 16 January 2012\nto 15 January 2013. The collection was closed and finalised on 16 January 2013\nand then subsequently informed the final 2012 Victorian Training Market\nReport.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nThis dataset is a complete state-wide digital land use map of Queensland. The dataset is a product of the Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) and was produced by the Queensland Government. It presents the most current mapping of land use features for Queensland, including the land use mapping products from 1999, 2006 and 2009, in a single feature layer. This dataset was last updated July 2012. See additional information also.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nIndicates the current primary use or management objective of the land.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nSource DataQueensland Government - Land use mapping (1999); Landsat TM and ETM imagery; Spot5 imagery; High resolution ortho photography through the Spatial Imagery Subscription Plan (SISP); Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) (2009), Queensland Valuation and Sales Database (QVAS) (2009); Queensland Nature Refuges (2009); Queensland Estates (2009); Queensland Herbarium's Regional Ecosystem, Water Body and Wetlands datasets (2009); Statewide Landcover & Trees Study (SLATS) Queensland Dams and Waterbodies (2009) and land cover change data; scanned aerial photography (1999-2009).Additional verbal & written information on land uses & their locations was obtained from regional Queensland Government officers, Local Government Authorities, land owners & managers, private industry as well as from field observations & checking.Data captureA range of existing digital datasets containing land use information was collated from the Queensland Government spatial data inventory and prepared for use in a GIS using ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine software.Processing steps To compile the 1999 baseline mapping, datasets containing baseline land cover (supplied by SLATS), Protected Areas, State Forest and Timber Reserves, plantations, coastal wetlands, reserves (from DCDB) and logged forests were interpreted in a spatial model to produce a preliminary land use raster image.The model incorporated a decision matrix which assigned each pixel a specific land use class according to a set of pre-determined rules.Individual catchments were clipped from the model output and enhanced with additional land use information interpreted primarily from Landsat TM and ETM imagery as well as scanned and hardcopy aerial photography (where available). The DCDB and other datasets containing land use information were used to help identify property and land use type boundaries. This process produced a draft land use raster.Verification of the draft land use dataset, particularly those with significant areas of intensive land uses, was undertaken by comparing mapped land use classes with observed land use classes in the field where possible. The final raster image was converted to a vector coverage in ARC/Info and GIS editing performed.The existing 1999 baseline (or later where available) land use dataset (vector) formed the basis for the 2006 and 2009 land use mapping. The 2006 & 2009 datasets were then updated primarily by interpretation of SPOT5 imagery, high-res orthophotography, scanned aerial photography and inclusion of expert local knowledge. This was performed in an ESRI ArcSDE geodatabase replication infrastructure, across some nine regional offices. The DCDB, QVAS, Estates, Queensland Herbarium wetlands and SLATS land cover change and waterbody datasets were used to assist in identification and delineation of property and land use type boundaries. Digitised areas of uniform land use type were assigned to land use classes according to ALUMC Version 7 (May 2010).This \"current\" land use mapping product presents a complete state-wide land use map of Queensland, after collating the most current land use datasets within a single mapping layer.An independent validation was undertaken to assess thematic (attribute) accuracy under the ALUM classification. Please refer to the orignal source data for the validation results.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nQueensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts (2013) Bioregional_Assessment_Programme_Land use mapping - Queensland current.

A single Australian World Heritage Areas database has been created by combining data which was historically stored as a separate set of data for each property. World Heritage Area buffer zones are also included in this dataset for relevant properties.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, the Tasmanian Wilderness, the Wet Tropics of Queensland and Shark Bay meet all four World Heritage criteria for natural heritage, with Kakadu National Park, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Willandra Lakes Region and the Tasmanian Wilderness being listed for both natural and cultural criteria. The 2010, 2012 and 2013 extensions to the Tasmanian Wilderness have been incorporated. The Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Naracoorte/Riversleigh), Lord Howe Island Group, Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, Fraser Island, Macquarie Island, Heard and McDonald Islands, the Greater Blue Mountains Area and Purnululu National Park are listed under the World Heritage criteria for natural heritage. The Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens, Melbourne were inscribed in the World Heritage List against Cultural criterion (ii): exhibit an important interchange of human values over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town planning or landscape design. The Sydney Opera House was inscribed in the World Heritage List in 2007 against Cultural criterion (i) (see http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria ) The Australian Convict Sites was inscribed on the World Heritage List on 31 July 2010. There are 11 sites that make up the World Heritage Australian Convict Sites against Cultural criterion (iv) and (vi). The Ningaloo Coast was inscribed on the World Heritage List in June 2011 against Natural criteria (vii) and (x). \nThe coastline of Queensland was produced under specific contract for Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) by AUSLIG in 1984. Originally engineered by AUSLIG from datasets produced by the Division of National Mapping and RAN Hydrographic Service; Queensland coastal information produced by AUSLIG at 250k scale with 100k elements from developing technology at the time of genesis; Island information is specific to the Great Barrier Reef Region as produced from RAN Hydrographic Service data at 100k scale. Updated against satellite imagery during the RAP process (2003-2004) to 25k scale, especially in Cairns, Whitsundays and Hinchinbrook Regions. This coastline is used to represent the coastal boundary of the Great Barrier Reef WHA, and is supplied by GBRMPA Spatial Data Centre.",

    "description": "    \n\nAusgrid is providing the following data on electricity consumption within our\nnetwork area for the 2009/2010 financial year to be used in developing\napplications. The data is from customer billing data and grouped by local\ngovernment areas (LGA) in Ausgridas network.\n\nAverage electricity consumption by geographic area can vary significantly due\nto a number of factors. These include differences in climate, the use of\nnatural gas, the type of housing (house or apartment), type of business\n(commercial or industrial), and varying household socio-demographics or\nbusiness types.\n\nThese figures also do not necessarily include the electricity used in common\nareas of apartments like halls, garages or pools. About 20% of energy in an\napartment building is typically used in these sorts of areas.\n\nThis data does not include high voltage customers and supply to services such\nas public lighting and bus shelters.\n\nFor help in interpreting the data, please contact\n[sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au](mailto:sharinginformation@ausgrid.com.au).\n\n",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Weekly Bus Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2019",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "\"The first capture of the area surrounding the Floreat Surf Life Saving Club, these sand dunes were captured by UAV imagery on 17th Aug 2021 for the Cambridge Coastcare beach dune modelling and monitoring project. It was created as part of an initiative to innovatively monitor coastal dune erosion and visualize these changes over time for future management and mitigation. This data includes Orthomosaic, DSM, DTM, Elevation Contours, 3D Mesh, 3D Point Cloud and LiDAR constructed from over 500 images captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh\nThe dataset is a Sparse 3D Point Cloud (i.e. a 3D set of points): the X,Y,Z position and colour information is stored for each point of the point cloud. This dataset is of the South Floreat SLSC (2021 Flight-1 project area).",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘Perched_aquifer_fresh.shp’ contains polygon data indicating the approximate boundary of the freshwater perched aquifer on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behavior on the island.  The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the freshwater perched aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA4. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA4 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates.

The previous “school classification” is no longer applicable.\n\n\nPrimary schools enrol students in Kindergarten to Year 6. \n\n\nSecondary schools generally enrol students in Years 7 to 12, although some secondary schools only enrol students in the senior years, i.e. Years 11 to 12 or the junior years, i.e. Years 7 to 10 (NSW School of Languages, Aurora College and Centre of Excellence in Agricultural Education are included in the ‘Other’ category under Secondary Schools. These schools do not have census enrolments.) . \n\n\nCentral/community schools have primary and secondary departments and may be established where there is an enrolment in secondary classes of 20 or more. Enrolments in primary departments and secondary departments are included with the appropriate student data.\n\n\nSchools for specific purposes (SSPs) are for students with specific needs. Most SSPs have permanent enrolments and include schools for students with intellectual (mild, moderate and severe) and physical disabilities, visual or hearing impairment, behaviour disorders or emotional disturbance, and students in juvenile justice centres. Some SSPs have no permanent enrolments because the children temporarily attending them are enrolled and counted in their own schools.

    "title": "Climate Vulnerability Assessment: High Rainfall Zone Grazing System",
    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the high rainfall zone grazing system model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "The digital ‘1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia’ comprises three layers: the primary 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology, the 1:100 000 State interpreted bedrock geology lines , and the 1:100 000 State linear structure layer. The product covers approximately 30% of Western Australia, with a focus on areas of exposed Archean and Proterozoic bedrock. The linear structure layer refers primarily to pre-Cenozoic bedrock structures. This compilation is based on Geological Survey of Western Australia’s (GSWA) published Geological Information Series (GIS) and Geological Exploration Packages (GEP) for which digital 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 interpreted bedrock geology is available. The data packages included are: Kimberley 2017, Tanami–Arunta 2016, West Musgrave 2017, East Albany–Fraser Orogen 2014 (1:250 000 pre-Mesozoic), West Capricorn 2016, East Yilgarn 2017, South Yilgarn 2016, Murchison 2017, and Pilbara 2014. Geological interpretation in these packages is based on extensive fieldwork and interpretation of geophysical datasets (magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), remote sensing imagery (ASTER and LANDSAT), seismic and magnetotelluric profiles, drilling, and previously published and unpublished geological mapping. With the exception of minor topological corrections, the spatial integrity of the source packages is maintained. For adjacent but separately compiled packages, seamless interpretation along the edges of project areas has not been executed in order to preserve the spatial integrity of the source information. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the lithostratigraphic units in the polygon and line layers are based on weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to provide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded stratigraphic units, display correct stratigraphic relationships, and include more recent geochronology. The source package of each feature is captured as an additional attribute field. Individual packages are available via the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety’s (DMIRS) eBookshop. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of closed treatment episodes by treatment delivery setting. A treatment episode is the period of contact between a client and a treatment provider where there are defined start (commencement) and end (cessation) dates. It is considered closed where any of the following occurs: treatment is completed or has ceased; there has been no contact between the client and treatment provider for 3 months; or there is a change in the main treatment type, principal drug of concern or delivery setting.\nThe alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the closed treatment episode was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment episodes are excluded from the AODTS NMDS if they: are not closed in the relevant financial year; are for clients who are receiving pharmacotherapy and not receiving any other form of treatment that falls within the scope of the collection; include only activities relating to needle and syringe exchange; or are for a client aged under 10 years.\n\n\nTreatment delivery settings is the main physical setting in which the type of treatment that is the principal focus of a client's alcohol and other drug treatment episode is actually delivered to a client (irrespective of whether or not this is the same as the usual location of the service provider).\n\n",

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nThis dataset comprises polygons that identify existing residential developments in a defined floodway where building controls are recommended on house extensions, redevelopment and fencing.\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFitzroy River – Fitzroy Crossing Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMurray River/Peel Inlet - Ballee, Yunderup and Cooleenup Islands, Culleenup Road and Pericho Close.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred.

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "Vectorized version of the Land Monitor Salinity Extent – South West of Western Australia 1990 dataset.\n\nSalinity mapped in raster format with 25-m pixels. The Land Monitor salinity mapping process uses satellite imagery, high-resolution topographic data, ground information and ancillary GIS data sets to map areas of severely salt-affected land identified in consecutive satellite (Landsat TM) scenes (Furby et al 2010). To update the 1990 and 1998 estimates, the spatial-temporal methodology was re-applied using the same approach but took advantage of the latest data and improved computational resources (Caccetta et al 2022). Any changes in the extent of salt affected land detected by Land Monitor in the updated salinity mapping are most likely within the severe salinity class and may represent either expansions of this class of salinity or improvements in the condition of severely salt affected land or in the reduction of commission errors (compared to the original mapping).\n\nThis data has converted the salt effected areas to a vector geodatabase. Additional post processing to remove urban areas has been applied.",

    "description": "The Local Government Performance Reporting Framework (LGPRF) is a mandatory system of performance reporting for all Victorian councils. It ensures that councils are measuring and reporting on their performance in a consistent way to promote transparency and accountability in the local government sector.\n\nThe framework is made up of 59 measures from a range of service areas, including roads, planning, animal management and waste. It is complemented by a Governance and Management checklist of 27 items, which shows the policies, plans and procedures in place at each council. Together, they build a comprehensive picture of council performance.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/know-your-council\">Know Your Council website</a> allows you to find your council and view profile details about each local government in Victoria.\n\nKnow Your Council and the LGPRF have been developed by Local Government Victoria (LGV) within the Department of Government Services (DGS). Mandatory performance reporting became a requirement for local government from the 2014-15 local government annual budgeting and reporting cycle onwards. \n\nWhen reviewing and analysing the full data set, it is important to acknowledge that:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nthe data in this data set may change as councils occasionally need to update their performance data ahead of their next Annual Report\n</li>\n<li>\n\nthe Variation commentary provided alongside the data should always be considered with any analysis or reporting of a council's data\n</li>\n<li>\n\nvariables in the data may not allow for accurate comparisons\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nAs such, in downloading this data, you have agreed not to use the council performance data set to aid in the publication of overly simplistic league tables of councils. \n\nDue to file size limitations LGV can only provide the 5 years of historical data.

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile.

The e-atlas data we have provided is site means… i.e.. the mean of those 25 values. \r\n- LCC - Live coral cover (percent cover), live hard and soft coral pooled.\r\n- LHC - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n- MAC - Macro Algae Cover % (fleshy algas only, does not include turf algae)\r\n- Fish Line_SUM - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. = total number of lines/1500m2.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.\tWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans, R.D., Jones, G.P., Russ, G.R.
