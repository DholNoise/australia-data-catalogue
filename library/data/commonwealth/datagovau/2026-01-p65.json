The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). \n\nThe site is classified as an open woodland savanna. The overstory is co-dominated by tree species <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em> and <em>Eucalyptus tentrodonata</em>, and average tree height is 14-16&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is close to 64&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 1750&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 30.4&nbsp;°C (in July) to 33.2&nbsp;°C (in November), while minimum temperatures range from 19.3&nbsp;°C (in July) to 25.4&nbsp;°C (in November). Therefore, the maximum and minimum range varies from 7&nbsp;°C (wet season) to 11&nbsp;°C (dry season).\n\nThe instrument mast is 23&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2021 projection, relative to a 2011 baseline, based on a scenario of buildings being retrofitted.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for May 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Access APIMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleCity of Parramatta Road Segment 3D May 2024Content TypeScene Layer/Scene Layer PackageDescriptionNSW Transport Theme Road Segment is a line feature class representing a section of road having common attributes and terminating at its physical and or at an intersection with another road at the same grade (same level). Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for beef producing farms for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Beef producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that had at least 100 head of beef cattle on hand at 30 June 2015. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. \r\n\r\n Meat & Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Average total cash receipts for Australian beef farms increased by around 14 per cent in 2014-15 to $391 000 and by a similar percentage in the following year to around $442 000. \r\n• The increases in total cash receipts largely reflected higher receipts from cattle sales, which were largely a result of higher cattle prices. \r\n• In real terms, estimated average farm cash incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 are among the highest recorded since 2000-01. \r\n• Northern region beef farms recorded higher average farm incomes than farms in the Southern region in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. \r\n• Reflecting higher incomes, the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for beef farms increased from -0.1 per cent in 2013-14 to 0.6 per cent in 2014-15 and is estimated to increase further in 2015-16 to around 1.9 per cent. \r\n• Average beef farm debt trended upwards, in real terms, between 2000-01 and 2014-15. In 2014-15 average total debt was around $460 000 a farm. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of a rapid increase in average farm size. \r\n• However, increases in debt over time has largely been supported by an accompanying increase in the total capital value of beef farms. Consequently, average farm business equity ratios remained relatively steady over the period 2000-01 to 2015-16. \r\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in February 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R4.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, February 19, 2012\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, February 25, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "A balanced summary of the water allocation accounts for each category of access licence.\n\nAllocation Account balances are the volume held in the allocation accounts at the time of reporting and are relevant for the various processes that either increase or decrease an allocation account throughout the water year. The volume of water in the licence allocation accounts at the time of reporting is a net balance for the relevant licence category. It represents the volume that can be carried forward to the next water year as dictated by the carryover rules in place for that year or required under the water sharing plan.\n\nA negative number for the carryover figure indicates that more usage has occurred than has been allocated to the account, and the deficit must be carried forward to the next season. Water that is in the accounts at the end of a water year but is not permitted to be carried over is forfeited and has been represented as a decrease in water liability.\n\nThe accounting presented is relevant to licence category and is therefore inclusive of licences held by environmental holders. The carryover volume of water in the allocation account for each licence category is determined once all transactions and end-of-year forfeit rules have been applied.\n\n<strong>Typical Transactions</strong>\nBelow is a list of typical transactions that can apply to an allocation account:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Available water determination (AWD)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allocation account usage</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Over-order debits</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Forfeiture due to:</strong><ul>\n<li>(i) no carryover being permitted (end-of-year forfeit)</li>\n<li>(ii) allocation account limits</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Licence conversion</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Trade of allocation water between accounts</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Carryover rules</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<strong>Notes</strong>\n<em>1: This is a subset of data (pertaining to several catchments as per attached xls files), and over time we may release more.</em>\n\n<em>2: This dataset is included in the General Purpose Water Accounting Reports: https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-general-purpose-water-accounting-reports</em>\n\n<em>3: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.</em>",

    "description": "ACT Canopy Estimate Statistics 2020 for blocks, divisions and road polygons are derived from the ACT Canopy Cover 2020 footprint dataset (available soon). The canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. This datasets provides the estimated % coverage of vegetation above 3m for blocks, division and road polygons current at 2021, and was completed by a collaboration between CED and TCCS, ACT Government. The canopy coverage % is determined by the coverage of vegetation above 3m divided by the area of feature (e.g. block area). The total tree canopy cover estimate for Canberra for 2020 is based on the footprint of all urban divisions (suburbs): 22.5%.

The point clouds were processed by the ACT Government with ArcGIS to produce ACT Canopy Cover footprint for vegetation above 3m. Canopy modelling was completed at 1m resolution. The canopy footprints were then augmented to block, division and road polygon coverage statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate system: GDA 2020 MGA Zone 55.\n\nTemporal coverage: April 2020\n\nUpdate schedule: every 5 years\n\n\n\nTile photo by Mark Jekabsons, Trees over Gungahlin\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveat: Comparison of the ACT 2020 Canopy Cover to the 2015 is not comparable due to differences in methodology, including differences in resolution and point density, and time of year the LiDAR was captured. The 2015 data was captured in late Autumn, whereas 2020 was captured in early Autumn.",

In cases where a partial surrender was approved during the term of the exploration licence, only the final area is represented in this dataset.\nExploration licence polygons delineate areas in which licence holders are permitted to explore for the listed categories of minerals. Exploration licences may be granted over both Crown and private land, so long as that land falls under the Mineral Resources Development Act 1995. Mineral exploration activities may include: geological, geophysical and geochemical surveys, drilling, and taking samples of rock, soil, water or other substances for analysis. Mining is not an exploration activity and cannot occur on an exploration licence.",

    "description": "Summary of species occurrence data from 1900 to 2020 for Australian terrestrial species organised by IBRA region and status as an introduced or invasive species using the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) list for Australia. Counts are provided by species and IBRA region for:\n\nThe total number of occurrence records within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period\n\nThe number of distinct species recorded within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period\nThe GRIIS list identifies species that are known or believed to have been introduced to Australia. Species that are not included in the GRIIS Australia list are treated here as native species. The GRIIS list also identifies a subset of introduced species as invasive species based on knowledge that these species have had a harmful impact. This dataset organises species occurrences using these GRIIS data to assign species to one of three categories:\n\n\nNative – not an introduced species\n\nIntroduced – an introduced species that is not considered invasive\nInvasive – an introduced species that is considered invasive  \n\nThe GRIIS lists have been compiled by experts with knowledge of introduced and invasive species in each country and are still being improved. It should particularly be noted that version 1.6 of the GRIIS Australia list includes a number of species which are native to Australia but which have been translocated to new parts of the country for conservation purposes. In future versions of the GRIIS Australia list, these species will be appropriately identified and can be excluded as required. This is important since the list does not indicate the areas in which the species is considered to have been introduced (including translocated). These species were manually excluded before the dataset was generated, but this version should be treated with caution. Future versions of this dataset will benefit from improvements to the GRIIS Australia list.  \nOccurrence records were aggregated and organised by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/) and include survey and monitoring data collected and managed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/).  \nTo find out more about this dataset, visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/summary-data-introduced-species-occurrences-by-terrestrial-ecoregion/\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.26197/ala.206e6580-ac7c-42c3-aaca-79256897bd57",

The Cudgegong River has a wide floodplain at Mudgee with the majority of the town built on higher ground on the southern bank of the river.\n\nThe town is subject to flooding from the following sources:\n• riverine flooding from Cudgegong River and Lawsons Creek, with their confluence on the\nnorth western edge of town;\n• flash flooding from multiple smaller creeks that originate on the south western edge of\nMudgee and traverse the town until their confluence with the Cudgegong River, and\n• local urban stormwater flooding.\n\nMajor flood events over the last 70 years have occurred in 1955, 1969, 1971, 1974 and 1990. The town also experienced major flooding in February 2003 and December 2010. Recent flood events of lesser magnitude have occurred in 2016 and 2017.",

    "description": "A coastline polygon was created from the 2011 digital elevation model (DEM) by Geoscience Australia using ArcMap. First, all the DEM pixels were reclassified using the ‘reclassify’ tool to give the value of zero, then using the ‘raster to polygon tool’ the coastline was generated. When compared to the 1:30,000 coastline, and the 2011 orthophotography, the accuracy is variable. As the LiDAR survey was conducted in some locations at low tide, the 2011 outline may include areas that are not actually considered island, such as sandbanks in shallow lagoon areas. The 2011 coastline does not follow the edge of ‘land’ as closely compared to the 2010 version in areas with extensive sand flats. The zero elevation level for survey used the CKIHD. The closure of the North Keeling lagoon is clear between the datasets.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates.

    "description": "The 2022 update of the digital '1:500 000 tectonic units of Western Australia' has been compiled using boundaries derived from the digital '1:500 000 State interpreted bedrock geology of Western Australia, 2020'. For the offshore component, the map uses data and divisions from the Geoscience Australia ‘Australian Geological Provinces’ GIS dataset, with polygons adjusted to match seamlessly into the onshore tectonic elements. The nomenclature and hierarchy for the tectonic units are based on weekly updates from the Explanatory Notes System (ENS). In order to\nprovide the most up-to-date geological information for the units in question, attribution from the original source is modified to remove superseded units, display correct tectonic relationships and include more recent geochronology. Significant changes to the tectonic framework of Western Australia in this version include: a) the obsolete Speewah Basin is now included in the Kimberley Basin; b) the obsolete Gunbarrel Basin is now part of the Canning Basin; c) the\nobsolete Northern and Southern Bonaparte Basins are combined into a single Bonaparte Basin, and the onshore extent of the Petrel Sub-basin has been modified to include the Weaber Group, and the offshore extent modified accordingly; d) the new Burringurrah Domain has been defined as part of the Gascoyne Province; e) the basaltic component of the Carson Volcanics is now represented as part of the Hart – Carson Large Igneous Province, rather than the Kimberley Basin into which it was extruded; f) significant re-interpretation of the granite–greenstone domains\nin the southwestern part of the Yilgarn Craton; g) the boundary between the Northern Perth Basin and Southern Carnarvon Basin has been modified along the western margin of the Northampton Inlier, and the offshore boundaries adjusted accordingly; h) the obsolete Pardoo Shelf has been assigned to the Lambert Shelf and extended onshore to the east of Port Hedland. The State is the highest level unit in the hierarchy and is subdivided at the next level into Archean to Paleoproterozoic cratons; Proterozoic orogens; Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic basins (or\nsuperbasins); and igneous supersuites. All units depicted on this map, with the exception of basins and some igneous supersuites, are at the third or lesser hierarchical level. Cratons are subdivided into superterranes, terranes and domains. Orogens are divided into provinces and orogenic forelands, and may also incorporate sedimentary basins; provinces are further subdivided into terranes/zones. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who consume more than two standard drinks per day on average. Lifetime risky alcohol consumption is defined as those adults who consume more than two standard drinks per day on average, thereby increasing their lifetime risk. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN105 and PHN106 should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates have a relative standard error of 25% to 50%.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

The data spans the months of 2004 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "The aim of this project is to compile land use and management practices and their observed and measured impacts and effects on vegetation condition. The results provide land managers and researchers with a tool for reporting and monitoring spatial and temporal transformations of Australia’s native vegetated landscapes due to changes in land use and management practices. Following are the details about the Cumberland State Forest, Old Abandoned Arboretum site, NSW, Australia. \n\nPre-European reference-analogue vegetation: The Cumberland State Forest is part of the Blue Gum High Forest (Daniel Connolly pers comm). It is a tall wet sclerophyll forest found on Wianamatta group Ashfield Shale. Blue Gum High Forest is dominated by Sydney blue gum (<em>Eucalyptus saligna</em>), blackbutt (<em>E. pilularis</em>), and turpentine (<em>Syncarpia glomulifera</em>) with a number of other eucalypts occurring patchily. A sparse open cover of small trees includes a variety of sclerophyllous and mesophyllous species. The ground layer is variable in composition and cover; including ferny, grassy or herbaceous and/or vines and climbers. The characteristics of the ground cover are related to the topgraphic position. \n\nBrief chronology of changes in land use and management:<ul>\n<li>1788- Area managed by indigenous Darug people</li>\n<li>1788-1824: Region explored, un-modified native forest blue gum/ironbark on shale</li>\n<li>1825: Parcel selected by Mr Shepherd</li>\n<li>1860: Tree cover likely to have been thinned - selective logging for fences and housing</li>\n<li>1826-1907: Grazing stock on native pastures</li>\n<li>1908: Land parcel cleared and sown to improved pasture, and evidence of chicken farm and fruit orchards</li>\n<li>1909-1937: Managed as improved pasture and grazing</li>\n<li>1937-38: Purchased by NSW Forestry Commission</li>\n<li>1941-42: Remaining native forest trees cleared to establish an arboretum</li>\n<li>1943-45: Arboretum planted as a future urban working forest</li>\n<li>1946-73: Arboretum managed for education and demonstration - infilling regrowth native forest observed</li>\n<li>1974-84: Arboretum increasing managed for recreation - infilling regrowth native forest observed</li>\n<li>1985-2012: Area managed for recreation (ex-arboretum and regrowth native forest).</li>\n\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of boys who were fully immunised against human papillomavirus (HPV). The data spans the financial years 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHPV is a common sexually transmitted infection. It is estimated that more than four out of five people will have an HPV infection at some point in their lives. Although often asymptomatic, HPV infection can cause a wide range of cancers, including cervical cancer, and other conditions such as genital warts. The Australian Government introduced the school-based National HPV Vaccination Program in 2007 for adolescent girls, and extended it to include boys in January 2013. The data were sourced from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register), which is operated by the Victorian Cytology Service. The HPV Register records information about HPV vaccine doses administered under the National HPV Vaccination Program in Australia. The data reported are for girls and boys aged 15 who had received three doses of HPV vaccine by 30 June 2016 (as at 12 August 2017). The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females and males aged 13 at 30 June 2014 was used for the denominator, as this reflects the eligible population at the time most vaccinations were administered.\n                                                For further information about this dataset, visit the data source:[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - HPV immunisation rates in 2015-16 Data Tables.](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/immunisation/hpv-immunisation-rates-2015-16/data)\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThese data include boys aged 15 who had received three doses of HPV vaccine by 30 June 2015 and 2016. Any doses administered after that date are not included and therefore the current coverage in this cohort may be higher than reported here. Only vaccinations reported to the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register) are included.\n\n\nBoys whose courses are considered to be incomplete according to the Chief Medical Officer guidelines and boys who do not wish their details to be recorded on the HPV Register are excluded.\n\n",

    "description": "Indicative map for Lowland Grassy Woodland:\nThe indicative map for Lowland Grassy Woodland was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. The determination of Lowland Grassy Woodland was reviewed by the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel), and a set of diagnostic parameters for the identifying the Lowland Grassy Woodland TEC was agreed upon.\nUsing these diagnostic parameters, we sampled candidate areas from existing vegetation maps to identify potential areas of Lowland Grassy Woodland occurrence in 296 000 hectares of State Forest and undertook additional mapping work using two independent mapping methods. Random Forest models (predictive habitat models) were generated using plot data and a selection of environmental variables. Aerial photo interpretation targeted stands of forests dominated by Eucalyptus tereticornis to refine the potential boundaries of Lowland Grassy Woodland.\nWe tested whether Lowland Grassy Woodland was present in State Forest by completing systematic plot surveys within mapped areas indicating potential presence. We compared our collected data to a large regional pool of plot data that contained a subset of plots assigned to vegetation map units cited in the determination for the Lowland Grassy Woodland TEC (see Gellie 2005, Tozer et al 2006, and Keith and Bedward 1999). Our analysis of data confidently assigned only a few plots in State Forest to Lowland Grassy Woodland (2/43).\nFrom these results, we were unable to construct an operational map for Lowland Grassy Woodland. The relationship between the existing mapping cited in the determination and the plot data on State Forest was not strong enough to be a reliable basis for mapping the TEC. We also found that Eucalyptus tereticornis could not reliably be used as an indicator of Lowland Grassy Woodland in State forests. As a result, we were unable to map this TEC from the few confirmed sampling points without including a significant area of forest that was highly unlikely to be Lowland Grassy Woodland. However, we created indicative maps of Lowland Grassy Woodland by merging our predictive and API maps to provide an indication of the likely extent of Lowland Grassy Woodland in State Forests.\nOperational map for Brogo Wet Vine Forest:\nThe operational map for Brogo Wet Wine Forest (BWVF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. We assessed whether BWVF was likely to be present in more than 296 000 hectares of State Forest in the South-east Corner Bioregion.\nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for BWVF and reaching an agreed interpretation of floristic, environmental and distributional characteristics. The Panel found that BWVF is primarily defined by a source vegetation community derived from quantitative floristic plot data (Keith and Bedward, 1999), with additional defining characteristics relating to bioregion and elevation.\nThe Panel’s interpretation resulted in the identification of all State Forests located below an elevation threshold of 550 metres within the South East Corner Bioregion as potentially containing BWVF. We identified other potential areas of BWVF by overlaying the cited vegetation maps and any State Forest mapping where vegetation was dominated by or includes Eucalyptus tereticornis (a defining species of BWVF).\nWithin these state forests, we used aerial photo interpretation (API) to identify and delineate potential areas of BWVF based on structural characteristics and overstorey and understorey attributes, namely dominance or inclusion of Eucalyptus tereticornis. \nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our study area. The floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We used multivariate analysis to compare plots assigned to vegetation communities identified as BWVF in the determination to all other plots in the study area. We used explicit membership thresholds to identify whether plots in State forests and elsewhere belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the BWVF determination.\nWe used the plot assignments to candidate BWVF to develop a predictive presence and absence Random Forest statistical model. The model generates a probability of occurrence of BWVF for each grid cell using plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables. \nWe constructed our operational map using the API line work in combination with the floristic plot data and our predictive habitat models to identify and map the locations and extent of BWVF. Our mapping identified six small areas of Brogo Wet Vine Forest totalling 17.5 hectares. All areas were within Bodalla State Forest and were located on the exposed lower slopes of Mount Dromedary.\nOperational map for Dry Rainforest of the South East Forests:\nThe operational map for Dry Rainforest of the South East Forests (Dry Rainforest) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. The determination of Dry Rainforest was reviewed by the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel), and a set of diagnostic parameters for the identifying the Dry Rainforest TEC was agreed upon.\nUsing these diagnostic parameters, we sampled candidate areas from existing vegetation maps to identify potential areas of Dry Rainforest occurrence in 296 000 hectares of State Forest and undertook additional mapping work using two independent mapping methods. Random Forest models (predictive habitat models) were generated using plot data and a selection of environmental variables. Aerial photo interpretation targeted stands of forests dominated by Ficus rubiginosa to refine the potential boundaries of Dry Rainforest.\nWe tested whether Dry Rainforest was present in State Forest by completing systematic plot surveys within mapped areas indicating potential presence. We compared our collected data to a large regional pool of plot data that contained a subset of plots assigned to vegetation map units cited in the determination for the Dry Rainforests TEC (see Keith and Bedward 1999). Our analysis of data confidently assigned only a few plots in State Forest to Dry Rainforest (2/21).\nFrom these results, we were able to construct an operational map for Dry Rainforest. We identified six small patches of Dry Rainforest but only one patch was located within the study area. This patch was located in Towamba State Forest and was 0.53 hectares.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.\nIndicative TEC Mapping have been generated from best available composite environmental data layers - standardised to 30 m pixels.",

    "description": "This data was collected in July/August 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1112V1.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania,  July 19, 2011\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  August 05, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Resource Management in Asia-Pacific (RMAP) Program based at The Australian National University in Canberra. \n*****\nThe South Pacific is home to the world's largest and most valuable tuna fishery. Despite this, the Pacific island countries have found it tremendously difficult to capture significant economic rents from the resource. It is argued in this paper that poor economic policy partly explains this. However, poor policies are preventing the implementation of strong, cost-effective institutions for the governance of the fishery which, coupled with strong institutions for broad social and economic governance, are required for development of the industry. Opportunities for policy reform that is likely to lead to significant gains from the fishery are highlighted.",

This has been calculated with the number of people who did not claim a GP attendance, divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as at 30 June 2016, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nUnique GP patients were identified through the Patient Identification Numbers (PINs) in the Medicare claim records.\n\n",

    "description": "Mating signals are often directed at numerous senses, and provide information about species identity, gender, receptiveness, individual identity and mate quality. Given the diversity of colourful body patterns in invertebrates, surprisingly few studies have examined the role of these visual signals in mate recognition. This experiment demonstrates that distinct carapace colour patterns in the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis, enable males to discriminate between their female neighbours and unfamiliar females.\n\nThe experiment was conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT from September to January 2003 and 2004. \n\nThe methodology involved identifying male and female U.capricornis neighbours living 10-30cm apart. The female was caught and randomly assigned to one of seven treatments, including replacement with a similar sized female, and various manipulations to alter her appearance. The female was then tethered close to the males burrow and the interaction monitored. The males behaviour was classified as either 'approach' or 'ignore.' The results show that males tended to approach unfamiliar females tethered nearby, whereas they were more likely to ignore their unaltered neighbours tethered in the same position.",

    "description": "This dataset contains topographic position index data from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "title": "Boreholes (from Earth Resource's database)",
    "description": "Contains mineral, petroleum, coal &amp; groundwater boreholes.  Minerals boreholes (and, to a lesser extent, petroleum wells) are actively maintained in the dataset.  The custodial role for groundwater and coal boreholes is in the private sector, and these parts of the dataset are not actively maintained.\n\nMineral, petroleum and coal boreholes are updated on an irregular basis:  Mineral borehole data are supplied by individual companies usually when their overlaying Exploration Licence expires; Coal borehole data have been updated from GHD Pty Ltd's (formerly GEO-ENG) data. Groundwater boreholes have not been updated since 1990 when the custodial role was given to Sinclair Knight Merz Pty Ltd (SKM) - refer to BORES100.\n\nThe origin of data varies considerably.  Prior to 1980 borehole data was recorded by the Geological Survey of Victoria (GSV) on 1 inch:1 mile plans and hard-copy borehole records.  This included data for water boreholes drilled by public and private sector, all boreholes drilled by GSV, petroleum wells, and some private-sector mineral exploration boreholes.  In areas where drilling was of particularly high density, locations were recorded on these plans as a single point or as occurring within an outlined area.\n\nThe parish was traditionally used as the primary classifier for numbering boreholes.  Some minor anomalies exist where a borehole and parish boundary may be on one side of a road or the other, or where parish boundaries have been moved.\n\nIn 1980 the location data was moved to 1:100,000 AMG plans.  In the mid-1980s a program of electronic capture commenced.  Borehole locations were digitised from the 1:100,000 plans with an accuracy of +/-300m.  For the areas of high borehole density where boreholes were plotted on a single point, often only the first ten and last ten were recorded in the database.  Boreholes whose parish was known but exact location was unknown were also recorded, but do not have a location.\n\nGroundwater boreholes:\nExtensive hydrological data was originally held by GSV, but these data are now held by SKM.  \n\nCoal boreholes:\nLocation and lithological data for coal boreholes has been provided by Geo-Eng and the old State Electricity Commission of Victoria.\n\nMineral exploration boreholes:\nThe capture of mineral exploration borehole data from open-file exploration reports commenced in 2001 and will progressively cover the state over a number of years.  The data are being captured at an whatever accuracy the source allows, typically between 20 and 250 m.  Assay data have been consistently captured.  Other downhole data, such as lithology, have not been consistently captured.\n\nTenement information for the small number of private-sector mineral exploration boreholes captured prior to 2001 was lost in the migration from the original VAX database to the current Ingres corporate database.\n\nHeavy mineral sand exploration: complete coverage up for data up to April 2002; updates planned for late 2003.\nOther mineral exploration:  coverage as follows - \n  St Arnaud, Charlton, Wedderburn 1:100 000 mapsheets - 31 March, 2001;\n  Dunolly, Rupanyup, Donald, Ararat, Grampians, Willaura 1:100 000 mapsheets -  30 August 2001;\n  Warburton 1:250 000 mapsheet - 30 June 2002 (available mid-2003);\n  Ballarat, Creswick, Skipton, Beaufort 1:100 000 mapsheets - 30 June 2002 (available mid-2003);\n  Bendigo 1:250 000 - 31 October 2002 (available mid-2003)\n\nGroundwater data can be obtained at the following site \nhttps://data.water.vic.gov.au/",

    "description": "AATAMS represents the higher biological monitoring of the marine environment for the IMOS program. Currently AATAMS uses acoustic technology, CTD satellite trackers and bio loggers to monitor coastal and oceanic movements of marine animals from the Australian mainland to the sub-Antarctic islands and as far south as the Antarctic continent. \n\nAcoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for observing tagged marine animals with networks or cross shelf arrays (curtains) of receivers, allowing animals to be monitored over scales of 100s of metres to 100s of kilometres. An array or network consists of a series of acoustic receivers that can be left on the sea floor for up to 7 years with the ability to upload data as often as needed. NCRIS and partner investments will target areas identified by regional nodes. Three regions will be targeted: the east coast of Australia, northwestern Western Australia and South Australia.\n\nVR2's deployed in conjunction with other moorings will provide information on long range movement of a variety of species including endangered and protected species (i.e. White Sharks and Grey Nurse Sharks), and valuable commercial species (i.e. Tuna)\n\nCurtains are mobile and can be deployed in different configurations for specific IMOS projects. The continued coordination of acoustic tag codes between researchers means that acoustic array around Australia will provide the combined infrastructure to monitor movement of highly migratory marine species between all jurisdictions.\n\nCTD satellite trackers and bio loggers currently deployed on a large range of animals are collecting a wide range of data. This includes behavioural and physical data such as the depth, temperature, salinity and movement effort of individual marine animals. \n\nAATAMS is set up to collect data over a long period of time. This sustained approach will enable researchers to assess the effects of climate change, ocean acidification and other physical changes that affect animals within the marine environment.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to estimate past sea-surface temperature in the Southeast Indian Ocean. The accumulation of diatom microplankton assemblages in sediments being the proxy for these records of climatic change. \n\nA transfer function is a mathematical method that allows quantitative estimations of environmental parameters from past biogenic sedimentation. In this study, a diatom transfer function was established to relate biological species to selected environmental parameter of the ocean (sea-surface temp). These equations were then employed on observed fossil species from core samples to provide quantitative estimates of sea-surface temperature.\n\nEstimates of sea-surface temperature are given here for core MD88-784. The information provided gives the extrapolated age-scale through the core, and two estimates of feb SST based on different diatom transfer functions (DTF 109/24/6 and DTF 166/34/4). \n\nIt is probable that the 'real' SST signal lies between the model estimates. The model diagnostics and lower number of non-analogue events from DTF 109/24/6 over that of results produced by DTF 166/34/4 suggest that SST estimates are closer to those provided by the former model.",

    "title": "Sulphate complexes of YREE as a key to understanding unconformity-related HREE deposits",
    "description": "Heavy rare earth elements are essential in renewable energy and high-tech products. Some natural rare earth element (REE) deposits exhibit heavy rare earth element (HREE) enrichment from &lt;&nbsp;10% to ~85% of the REE budget (Williams-Jones et al., 2015). \n\n\n\nControls on REE fractionation in hydrothermal systems are imposed by (1) changes in the relative stability of REE aqueous complexes with temperature (Migdisov et al., 2016) and (2) incorporation or rejection of REE by crystalline structures. Also, the REEs are invariably found as solid solutions but not as pure minerals. REE and yttrium (Y) sulphate complexes are some of the most stable REE and Y aqueous species in hydrothermal fluids (Migdisov and William-Jones, 2008, 2016; Guan et al., 2022) and may be responsible for REE transport and deposition in sediment-hosted deposits. Within the unconformity-related deposits, REEs are hosted mostly by xenotime ((Y,Dy,Er,Tb,Yb)PO4) and minor florencite ((La,Ce)Al3(PO4)2(OH)6) (Nazari-Dehkordi et al., 2019). Modelling the stability of xenotime in the H-O-Cl-(±F)-S-P aqueous system is critical for understanding HREE enrichment in this mineral system.\n\n\n\nWe use a newly derived thermodynamic dataset depos for REESO4+ and REE(SO4)2‑ aqueous complexes to generate stability diagrams illustrating mechanisms of REE transport and deposition in the above deposits. Sulphate REE complexes may dominate even in chloride-rich brines and facilitate REE mobilization in acid oxidizing environments. Previously Nazari-Dehkordi et al. (2019) proposed an ore genesis model involving the mixing of discrete hydrothermal fluids that separately carried REE + yttrium and phosphorus. The speciation model that includes sulphate complexes expands this scenario; a process resulting in fluid neutralization or reduction will also promote precipitation of xenotime enriched in HREEs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis Abstract was submitted/presented to the 2022 Specialist Group in Geochemistry, Mineralogy and Petrology (SGGMP) Conference 7-11 November (https://gsasggmp.wixsite.com/home/biennial-conference-2021)",

    "description": "Knowledge on the spatial distribution and inter-specific association patterns in tree species is essential in plant ecology to understand ecological mechanisms and dynamic process operating in spatial distribution of a tree population in a plant community. We measured and compiled datasets on three tropical tree species from a moist semi deciduous forest. We used the software Programita to perform univariate and bivariate point pattern analysis by Ripley's L-function. These datasets can be used to inform on possibilities of interaction of these species in forest stands. These datasets can be also used to access the capacity of each tree of <i>Mansonia altissima</i> var. <i>altissima</i> A. Chev. to develop and grow or its exclusion probability within a plant community. <i>Mansonia altissima</i> A. Chev. is a plant species represented by only one-population in a moist semi-deciduous forest in Republic of Benin. Our project aims to understand its ecology for restoration and conservation purposes within its natural habitat as well as other habitats inside of its distribution range.",

    "description": "This study examines the effects of experimental trampling on Hormosira banksii dominated rocky intertidal platforms within the Point Nepean National Park, Victoria between 1991 and 1996. This dataset gives the percent cover of the brown algae Hormosira banskii in response to different intensities and histories of experimental trampling.  Percent cover of Hormosira banksii was assessed on three occasions: end of summer 1994-1995, pre-summer 1995-1996, end of summer 1995-1996.  A comparison of areas of shoreline that had been trampled for two and four summers did not appear to influence the response to a new trampling episode.  However, it was recognised that a mild summer experience during the trial may have reduced the potential impact of trampling,  weakening the capacity to detect historical effects.",

The data spans the months of 2003 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in January 2009, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

To date, we have identified over 90 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages in more than 1400 State Library collection items. These language materials are books, music, computer files, journals, visual works and archival collections.  \n\nThe metadata in these records is the key to users discovering and accessing language materials inside and outside the library catalogue. In 2019, the metadata was enhanced with updated reference names and codes as part of the AUSTLANG national code-a-thon. The AUSTLANG database is managed by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies and includes geographic, historical, classification and research information about each identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language. \n\nAdditional information about Indigenous Languages at State Library is available at: https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/discover/first-nations-cultures/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-languages \n\nAlso available in State Library’s library catalogue http://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au \n\nExplore State Library’s events, programs and services at https://slq.qld.gov.au ",

    "description": "This record describes multibeam echosounder data collected on IN2025_V05, 'Eruption, destruction and seafloor ecosystem recovery – Tonga 2022 eruption of the century', which departed Hobart on 10 Aug and ended in Brisbane on 01 Oct 2025 (local). The voyage’s first leg transited from Hobart to Nuku’alofa (10–19 Aug 2025), where science participants boarded. A mid-voyage transfer occurred on 05 Sep, and all science personnel disembarked in Nuku’alofa on 23 Sep before the final transit to Brisbane (23 Sep–1 Oct 2025).\n\nThe EM2040MK2 provides a 0.4 degree by 0.7 degree angular resolution. The echosounder's nominal frequency is 400 kHz (with a range of 200-700 kHz) and it operated in dual swath mode. \n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 71 files totalling 26 GB of raw data and 71 files totalling 203 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

    "description": "Access APIMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent Title&nbsp;Snowy Monaro Segment 3D May 2024Content TypeScene Layer/Scene Layer PackageDescriptionNSW Transport Theme Road Segment is a line feature class representing a section of road having common attributes and terminating at its physical and or at an intersection with another road at the same grade (same level). Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in May 2014, in waters off South Australia. \n\n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (DCM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "title": "Effect of chemical abrasion of zircon on SHRIMP U-Pb, d180O, Trace element, and LAICPMS trace element and Lu Hf isotopic analyses",
    "description": "This study assesses the effect of chemical abrasion on in-situ mass spectrometric isotopic and elemental analyses in zircon. Chemical abrasion improves the U-Pb systematics of SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analyses of reference zircons, while leaving other isotopic systems largely unchanged. SIMS 206Pb/238U ages of chemically abraded reference materials TEMORA-2, 91500, QGNG, and OG1 are precise to within 0.25 to 0.4%, and are within uncertainty of chemically abraded TIMS reference ages, while SIMS 206Pb/238U ages of untreated zircons are within uncertainty of TIMS reference ages where chemical abrasion was not used. Chemically abraded and untreated zircons appear to cross-calibrate within uncertainty using all but one possible permutations of reference materials, provided that the corresponding chemically abraded or untreated reference age is used for the appropriate material. In the case of reference zircons QGNG and OG1, which are slightly discordant, the SIMS U-Pb ages of chemically abraded and untreated material differ beyond their respective 95% confidence intervals.\n\nSIMS U-Pb analysis of chemically abraded zircon with multiple growth stages are more difficult to interpret. Treated igneous rims on zircon crystals from the S-type Mount Painter Volcanics are much lower in common Pb than the rims on untreated zircon grains. However, the analyses of chemically abraded material show excess scatter. Chemical abrasion also changes the relative abundance of the ages of zircon cores inherited from the sedimentary protolith, presumably due to some populations being more likely to survive the chemical abrasion process than others. We consider these results from inherited S-type zircon cores to be indicative of results for detrital zircon grains from unmelted sediments.\n\nTrace element, &delta;18O, and εHf analyses were also performed on these zircons. None of these systems showed substantial changes as a result of chemical abrasion. The most discordant reference material, OG1, showed a loss of OH as a result of chemical abrasion, presumably due to dissolution of hydrous metamict domains, or thermal dehydration during the annealing step of chemical abrasion. In no case did zircon gain fluorine due to exchange of lattice-bound substituted OH or other anions with fluorine during the HF partial dissolution phase of the chemical abrasion process. As the OG1, QGNG, and TEMORA-2 zircon samples are known to be compositionally inhomogenous in trace element composition, spot-to-spot differences dominated the trace element results. Even the 91500 megacrystic zircon pieces exhibited substantial chip-to-chip variation. The LREE in chemically abraded OG1 and TEMORA-2 were lower than in the untreated samples. Ti concentration and phosphorus saturation ((Y+REE)/P) were generally unchanged in all samples.\n\n<b>Citation:</b> Kooymans, C., Magee Jr., C. W., Waltenberg, K., Evans, N.

It combines population size and geographic remoteness to guide health workforce planning, especially in rural and remote communities. MMM is based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) and is updated after each national Census conducted by the ABS.\r\n\r\nStatistical Area Level 4 (SA4)\r\n\r\nSA4s are the largest sub-state regions used in the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), built from SA3s. They are designed to reflect labour markets and the functional areas of capital cities, supporting the release of regional data such as the Quarterly Labour Force Survey. There are 108 SA4s across Australia, including special codes for mobile or unlocated populations. SA4s aggregate to form Greater Capital City Statistical Areas and States/Territories.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who have a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally for all first births, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who had a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth for the first time and birth vaginally, divided by the number of females who gave birth for the first time and birth vaginally, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nBirths included are vaginal births, including non-instrumental and instrumental births.\n\n\nBirths excluded are caesarean sections.\n\n\nThird-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in second-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal sphincter, rectrovaginal septum, and sphincter not otherwise specified. Excludes laceration involving the anal or rectal mucosa. A fourth-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in third-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal mucosa and rectal mucosa.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nData for SA3 of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of live-born babies at or after term with an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes for births at or after term. This has been calculated with the number of live-born babies at or after term (from 37 completed weeks gestational age) with an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes, divided by the number of live-born babies born at or after term (from 37 completed weeks gestational age), and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more. If the baby is alive the birth is a live birth. If the baby is not alive the birth is a stillbirth.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks. The term is defined as gestational age between 37 and 41 weeks.\n\n\nBirths included are live-born babies born at or after term.\n\n\nBirths excluded are stillbirths and babies born before term (before 37 weeks).\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "The record describes data collected from a winter deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored in the central part of Jervis Bay, New South Wales (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the winter deployment, 26th July 1991 to 26th September 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 60 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\nThe water depth was measured as 24m on deployment and the first 19 bins provided good data. Currents from bin 20 up were very noisy and it is inferred that contamination had occurred. These bins were removed from the dataset.\n\nTwo resources are provided in this record: 1) A schematic of depth bin location for the winter deployment and, 2) The raw, or unfiltered current values for each bin depth provided every 60 minutes in terms of east/west and north/south components.\n\nThis child record relates to the parent, c571bb80-2ae7-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.",

    "description": "The 2017 Land use captures how the landscape in NSW is being used for food production, forestry, nature conservation, infrastructure and urban development. It can be used to monitor changes in the landscape and identify impacts on biodiversity values and individual ecosystems.\n\nThe NSW 2017 Land use mapping is dated September 2017. \n\nThis is version 1.5 of the dataset, published December 2023.\n\nVersion 1.5 of the 2017 Land use incorporates the following updates:\n<ul>\n<li>Fine scale mapping of the Central Coast, Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions</li>\n<li>Mapping enhancements to regional centres to improve the mapping accuracy for these centres</li>\n<li>NSW road network based on road centreline data from Transport NSW, with standardised buffer applied to approximate the carriage width based on the road type</li>\n<li>Plantation type (native hardwood and softwood) information within State Forest Estates </li>\n<li>Horticulture data to tertiary or commodity level present in September 2017 from Australian Tree Crop Map Dashboard developed by University of New England - Applied Agricultural Remote Sensing Centre \nhttps://www.une.edu.au/research/research-centres-institutes/applied-agricultural-remote-sensing-centre/collaborative-r-and-d-opportunities/industry-applications-and-maps</li>\n<li>Fixes to identified errors since published version 1.2 </li>\n</ul>\n\nPrevious Versions\n*Version 1.4 internal update (not published)\n* Version 1.3 internal update (not published)\n* Version 1.2 published 24 June 2020 - Fine scale update to Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area\n* Version 1 published August 2019\n\nThe 2017 Land use is based on Aerial imagery and Satellite imagery available for NSW. These include, but not limited to; digital aerial imagery (ADS) captured by NSW Department of Customer Service (DCS), high resolution urban (Conurbation) digital aerial imagery captured on behalf of DCS, SPOT 5, 6 &amp; 7(Airbus), Planet™, Sentinel 2 (European Space Agency) and LANDSAT (NASA) Satellite Imagery. Mapping also includes commercially available imagery from Nearmap™ and Google Earth™, along with Google Street View™.   \n\nMapping takes into consideration ancillary datasets such as tenure such as National Parks and State forests, cadastre, roads parcels, land zoning, topographic information and Google Maps, in conjunction with visual interpretation and field validation of patterns and features on the ground. \n\nThe 2017 Land use was captured on screen using ARC GIS (Geographical Information Software) at a scale of 1:8,000 scale (or better) and features are mapped down to 2 hectares in size. Exceptions were made for targeted Land use classes such as horticulture, intensive animal husbandry and urban environments, which were mapped at a finer scale.\n\nThe 2017 Land use has complete coverage of NSW. It also includes updates to the fine scale Horticulture mapping for the east coast of NSW - Newcastle to the Queensland boarder and Murray-Riverina Region.  This horticultural mapping includes operations to the commodity level based on field work and high-resolution imagery interpretation. \n\nLand use classes assigned are based on activities that have occurred in the last 5-10 years that may be part of a rotational practice. Time-series LANDSAT information has been used in conjunction with more recent Satellite Imagery to determine whether grasslands have been disturbed or subject to ongoing land management activities over the past 30 years.\n\nThe 2017 Land use was captured on screen using ARC GIS (Geographical Information Software) at a scale of 1:8,000 scale (or better) and features are mapped down to 2 hectares in size. Exceptions were made for targeted Land use classes such as horticulture, intensive animal husbandry and urban environments (including Greater Sydney Metropolitan region), which were mapped at a finer scale. \n\nThe reliability scale of the dataset is 1:10,000.\n\nMapping has been subject to a peer review and quality assurance process.\n\nLand use information has been captured in accordance with standards set by the Australian Collaborative Land Use Mapping Program (ACLUMP) and using the Australian Land Use and Management ALUM Classification Version 8. The ALUM classification is based upon the modified Baxter &amp; Russell classification and presented according to the specifications contained in http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification.\n\nThis  product will be incorporated in the National Catchment scale land use product 2020 that will be available as a 50m raster - Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/data-download\n\nThe Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) will continue to complete land use mapping at approximately 5-year intervals. \n\nThe 2017 Land use product is considered as a benchmark product that can be used for Land use change reporting. Ongoing improvements to the 2017 Land use product will be undertaken to correct errors or additional improvements to the mapping.  ",

Area is not the principal basis for determining the predominant use. The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2024-25</em>.

The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Significant Trees and North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.\n\n",

    "description": "Wine grape farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated wine grape farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies and with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on wine grape farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, where most of the Basin's wine grapes are produced. Average farm cash incomes of wine grape farms rose from 2006-07 to 2011-12 before falling in 2012-13 in response to lower grape production. An increase in production contributed to slightly higher average farm cash incomes in 2013-14 and 2014-15. \r\n\r\n Grape crops in many areas of the Basin require regular irrigation because of the warm and relatively dry climate. From 2006-07 to 2014-15 the average volume of water used on wine grape farms mostly increased with this increase mainly due to an increase in average farm size. The proportion of grape farms using drip/trickle irrigation technologies has increased. \r\n\r\n The number of grape growers trading temporary water allocations varied from year to year. The years with the highest proportions of net buyers were 2007-08 and 2008-09. ",
