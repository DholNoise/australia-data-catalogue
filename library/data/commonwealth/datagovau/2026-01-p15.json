The investigations were made in January, 1955 for the purpose of comparing the performance of the Radore equipment with that of lower-frequency electromagnetic equipment previously used successfully over the same areas.  The results show that although some very weak indications were recorded by the Radore equipment, it has not been possible to correlate these satisfactorily with the know mineralisation.  Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish indications that may possibly be due to mineralisation from apparent indications that are undoubtedly due to irregularities in topography.",

    "description": "We recently discovered two new pulsars J1849+1001 (35.1 ms) and J1839+0542 (57.9 ms) in a FAST pulsar survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes (PT2020_0141). Follow-up timing observations show that they are in circular orbits with massive companions. This suggests that PSR J1849+1001 and J1839+0542 can be classified as the intermediate-mass binary pulsar (IMBP). Their massive companions also make them promising systems to measure \"Post-Keplerian\" parameters through pulsar timing. These Parkes observations will be combined with regular timing observations with FAST or MeerKAT to measure \"Post-Keplerian\" parameters and then measure both neutron star and companion masses.",

    "title": "Mapping of temperate subtidal seagrass beds in Tayaritja Sea Country (Furneaux Group of Islands), Lutruwita (Tasmania) (NESP MaC 3.6)",
    "description": "Seagrass beds are a dominant marine ecosystem of Tayaritja (the Furneaux Group of Islands) in the north-eastern waters off Tasmania. Historical coarse mapping has indicated extensive beds of Posidonia, Amphibolis, Heterozostera, and Zostera species, potentially comprising some of the largest and deepest seagrass extents found in temperate Australian waters. However, limited data on the distribution and ecological value of these seagrass habitats represents a significant knowledge gap in understanding Australia's wetland natural assets.\n\nThis project mapped the extent, ecological composition, population structure, and blue carbon value of seagrass beds around Tayaritja, in partnership with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre. The study area focused on the coastal waters surrounding Flinders Island in the western Furneaux Group, with mapping extending from the high tide line to the depth limit of reliable optical detection (approximately 30 m), based on analysis of field data and satellite imagery capabilities in the region.\n\nThis record specifically describes the benthic mapping component of the study. See https://doi.org/10.25959/WRXK-KV06 for imagery annotation data from the field validation campaigns.\n\nA combination of close-range remote sensing methods was used to map the extent and ecological values of seagrass beds. The approach developed through this study contributed to the creation of the NESP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Seagrass Mapping using Optical Remote Sensing (https://sustainabledevelopmentreform.github.io/nesp-sop-seagrass-mapping)..\n\nHigh-resolution satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 (10 m) sensors, combined with bathymetric LiDAR data and oceanographic variables, was used to map baseline seagrass extent and composition. A field campaign deployed a Benthic Observation Survey System (BOSS) and unBaited Remote Underwater stereo-Video system (stereo-uBRUV) at approximately 400 locations to validate remote sensing outputs. From these data, maps were produced showing the extent and coverage of seagrass, sand, and macroalgae, and where possible, seagrass species composition, subject to water depth and clarity constraints.\n\nSee the \"Lineage\" section of this record for full methodology.\n\nThree key types of mapping products were developed:\n\n---Occurrence probability maps---\nContinuous probability surfaces (0-100%), modelled from presence/absence data, indicating the likelihood of habitat presence at each pixel for:\n• Seagrass (all morphologies; &gt; 5% cover observed in underwater field imagery)\n• Macroalgae species/assemblages\n• Sand\n\n---Habitat percentage cover maps---\nQuantitative estimates of percent cover for each habitat category:\n• Seagrass (all morphologies)\n• Macroalgae species/assemblages\n• Sand\n\n---Derived products---\n• Baseline binary presence/extent maps derived from optimised probability thresholds:\n    ○ Seagrass:     sgprob &gt; 0.5 &amp; sgprob &gt; macroprob &amp; sandcover &lt; 0.9\n    ○ Macroalgae: macroprob &gt; 0.5 &amp; macroprob &gt; sgprob &amp; sandcover &lt; 0.9\n    ○ Sand:           sandprob &gt; 0.5 &amp; sandcover &lt; 0.2\n• Predicted seagrass species composition of binary extent map.\n• Fractional cover visualisation: combining cover percentages of multiple habitats into a single composite product\n• Composite habitat maps: combining binary habitat extents and delineating mixed habitat classes\n\nThese complementary products serve different purposes: probability maps provide confidence measures, extent maps delineate habitat boundaries, percent cover maps support quantitative analysis of habitat density patterns, and composite habitat maps represent the diversity of mixed habitat classes. Together, they provide a comprehensive understanding of seagrass and associated habitat distribution across the study area.",

    "description": "Natasha Adams, surveyor, carried out surveys on Macquarie Island for the Australian Antarctic Division between September and November 1997.\r\n\r\nA number of science programs required survey assistance on Macquarie Island.   \r\n\r\nFour major tasks were to be performed during the period of 13 September to 24 November 1997. These, in order of priority were\r\n\r\n1 ASAC Project 2277: Track monitoring and assessment - location of tracks and monitoring of vegetation type and degradation in conjunction with Judith Urquhart\r\n\r\n2 ASAC Project 1015: Location of botanical transects on four mountains for Craig Tweedie\r\n\r\n3 Location of points of interest for Clive Crossley\r\n\r\n4 Second order levelling between the Garden Cove Tide Gauges and the AFN site AUS211 \r\n\r\nThree other tasks were also undertaken in spare time whilst on the island\r\n\r\n1 Location of Geological sites for Garry Davidson\r\n\r\n2 Location of Royal Penguin Rookery boundaries at Sandy Bay and Bauer Bay for Mark Hindell\r\n\r\n3 Location and heights of the named mountain tops on the island for AUSLIG \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInformation about the survey and data are provided in two reports:\r\n\r\nN. Adams, 'Survey Report for Macquarie Island, September to November 1997' and M. King, R. Coleman and P. Standen, 'GPS data processing, Macquarie Island, September to November 1997'.\r\n\r\nAvailable for download from the URLs below are:\r\n\r\n(i) The differentially corrected point data from the walking track survey, as a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nAttributes include surface, disturbance indicators, drainage and gradient.\r\n\r\n(ii) Vegetation along the walking tracks (points) extracted from the differentially corrected point data, as a shapefile. \r\n\r\n(ii) Walking tracks (lines) generated from the differentially corrected point data, as a shapefile. \r\n\r\n(iii) Natasha's survey report as a pdf.\r\n\r\nThe walking tracks are displayed in a pair of A3 1:50000 maps produced by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre. \r\n\r\nA map list in the URLs below allows access to the Map Catalogue entries for these maps from which the maps can be viewed or downloaded as pdfs.",

    "description": "Ambulance Victoria has two official response time targets: Respond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 85% of incidents state-wide, and\nRespond to Code 1 incidents within 15 minutes for 90% of incidents in urban centres with populations greater than 7,500. Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1\", and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nUrban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population.\nAmbulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population\nexceeds 7,500 persons.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\n\n\nThis Land and Soil Capability (LSC) dataset uses the best available soils natural resource mapping across New South Wales. It provides a broad-scale, regional view as to the dominant LSC class present for over 3000 individual mapping units through the assessment of eight key soil and landscape limitations (water erosion, wind erosion, salinity, topsoil acidification, shallow soils/rockiness, soil structure decline, waterlogging and mass movement).\n\n\n\nThe assessment of LSC is based on the mapping method and rule set developed by OEH (2012). It builds on the rural land capability classification and mapping undertaken for the central and eastern divisions of the state by the former Soil Conservation Service of NSW (Emery 1986) but with more emphasis on a broader range of soil and landscape properties.\n\n\n\nThe mapping is based on an eight class system with values ranging between 1 and 8 which represent a decreasing capability of the land to sustain landuse. Class 1 represents land capable of sustaining most landuses including those that have a high impact on the soil (e.g., regular cultivation), whilst class 8 represents land that can only sustain very low impact landuses (e.g., nature conservation).\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe best available soils datasets were sourced to provide a single (seamless where possible) layer across NSW. Datasets collated to derive this map included:\n\n published and draft 1:100,000 soil landscape mapping \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n published and draft 1:250,000 soil landscape mapping \\[1:250,000 scale\\]\n\n Soil and Land Resources of the Hawkesbury Nepean Catchment \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Soil and Land Resources of the Liverpool Plains Catchment \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Reconnaissance Soil and Land Resources of the Murray CMA Catchment \\[1:100,000 & 1:250,000 scale\\]\n\n Soil Landscapes of the SCA Hydrological Catchments \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Soils landscapes of the Comprehensive Coastal Assessment (Bare Point, Jervis Bay, Batemans Bay and Ulladulla) \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Southern Comprehensive Regional Assessment \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Northern Comprehensive Regional Assessment \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Reconnaissance soil landscapes of the Namoi CMA \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Reconnaissance soil landscapes of the Upper Riverina (HSHL) \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Reconnaissance soil landscapes of the Border Rivers/Gwydir CMA \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Brigalow Belt South Western Regional Assessment \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Reconnaissance Soil Landscapes of the Upper Macleay Catchment \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Upper Murrumbidgee Soil Benchmarking project \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Glen Innes Data Gap Reconnaissance Soils Mapping \\[1:100,000 scale\\]\n\n Soil Information for the Nyngan 1:250,000 sheet \\[1:250,000 scale\\]\n\n Soil Information for the Walgett 1:250,000 sheet \\[1:250,000 scale\\]\n\n Soil Information for the Gilgandra 1:250,000 sheet \\[1:250,000 scale\\]\n\n Reconnaissance soil landscapes of the Riverine Plains \\[1:500,000 scale\\]\n\n Land Systems of the Western Division \\[1:250,000-1:500,000 scale\\]\n\n Land Systems of the Cobar Peniplain Bioregion \\[1:250,000-1:500,000 scale\\]\n\nAll map units were assigned a unique master landscape code and then assessed for eight soil or landscape limitations: topsoil acidification, salinity, water erosion, wind erosion, mass movement, shallow soils/rock outcrop, soil structure decline and waterlogging. This information was stored and interpreted using a rule set (http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/soils/20120394lsc2spubslandingpage.htm) in the Access Based Data Utility for Land and soil capability (ABDUL) expert system. The system allows for a manual override to modify LSC values when required. The most limiting LSC of the 8 hazards represents the overall LSC result for each map unit The overall LSC was linked to the geodatabase to produce the final map.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Environment and Heritage (2013) Land and Soil Capability mapping of NSW.

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Darwin City in NT with SA2 code 701011002, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

A Location SA Data mentor will monitor the GovHack slack channel on the weekend for troubleshooting.\nThis services will be free and active until 30 September 2017 (or the GovHack international Red Carpet Awards if after this date) to support the pilot and showcase GovHack concepts created using Location SA data services.

This data identifies what individual species were found in the Little Things that Run the City Project and is not a count of all species recorded. This data was obtained from Luis Mata, a postdoctoral researcher at RMIT. The data is owned by the City of Melbourne and RMIT. The project started in October 2014 with the first survey of insects for this project in parks and gardens in the City of Melbourne. More surveys were conducted between January and March 2015. Insect species were sorted and identified from April to September 2015. This is the raw data for the report that was published in late 2016.\n\n\n\nSome records are lacking information on the species classifcation level, and may have the correct genus information accompanied with a number in the identification notes column - this donates species 1, 2, or 3 of that genus where the species could not be identfiifed. All records lack a species name as this was not provided to the City of Melbourne in the original dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2007 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "title": "Distribution of cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) density and abundance in the Wet Tropics of Australia 2014 - 2014 (NERP TE 3.4 CSIRO)",
    "description": "This dataset contains the estimated distribution and abundance of cassowaries across the Wet Tropics Region and the sub-regions used in these estimates.  The key areas for cassowary conservation are those with the highest densities and abundance.\r\n\r\nThis data is based on field surveys and data on cassowary density derived from faecal-DNA analysis of dung samples collected during those surveys.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nSurveys were conducted along 157 transects distributed across the Wet Tropics Region during 2012 - 2014.  During these surveys all forms of cassowary sign were recorded and in the case of dung the dung was also collected.  Cassowary DNA was extracted from the dung samples and DNA fingerprinting analysis was used to identify individuals.  Based on the relationship between dung encounter rates and density of cassowaries at 8 focal sites, the density of cassowaries and their abundance on transects in each of 23 sub - regions was estimated.\r\nThe sub - regions were based on the estimated cassowary essential habitat. Essential habitat is based on verified sightings of the Southern Cassowary since 1980 and includes vegetation considered to be important for the species in terms of foraging, breeding or other parts of the species' life cycle. This habitat is considered to be necessary for the long-term survival of the cassowary. The important vegetation types associated with essential habitat (91 Regional Ecosystems) are listed within Kutt and colleagues (2004).\r\nFurther details of the methods are provided in the technical report for this work, Westcott (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\neAtlas Note: The original shapefile provided by the researchers has very fine boundary mapping from the cassowary essential habitat mapping. This is then broken down into 23 regions. The scale of these two datasets is vastly different and needs to be considered when using or interpreting this data.\r\nA slightly lower resolution version of this data was prepared for download from the eAtlas. This reduces the fine scale habitat mapping slightly, whilst retaining the cassowary regional information. The mapping layer associated with this record corresponds to the original high resolution version.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nOriginal Shapefile (452 polygons, 25 MB) of the 23 subregions of the Wet Tropics with estimated density and animal numbers. The detail of the region boundaries are based on very detailed estimated essential cassowary habitat mapping Kutt (2004). \r\n\r\nSimplified Shapefile (23 polygons, 2.6 MB). This contains the same cassowary estimated density and animal numbers across the Wet Tropics except with simplified habitat mapping. This was derived from the original by dissolving polygons with the same data, then smoothing the polygon using a 150m filter, then simplifying the polygon with an allowable tolerance of 15 m and removing features smaller than 2 hectares. This shapefile was prepared by the eAtlas team. This simplified version is more suitable for large scale maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\n- CassBound: Name of the cassowary mapping region \r\n- CassDens: Estimated density of cassowary in animals per square km.\r\n- Cass_num: Estimated number of cassowaries in region.\r\n- Hectare: Area of the mapping region in Hectares.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nKutt A.

    "description": "This project is to continue timing and profile studies of the first double-pulsar system, a unique laboratory for gravitational physics. Important results published in our 53-page Phys. Rev. X paper (2021) include the first measurements of higher-order light-propagation effects and of the relativistic deformation of the orbit and highlight the importance of a long term observational campaign, including VLBI observations, for this remarkable system. The main aims of this proposal are to provide the strongest tests to date for general relativity and to measure for the first time the moment-of-inertia of a neutron star. Additionally, we will determine the system geometry, map the pulsar beams via geodetic precession, and search for the reappearance of Pulsar B. We exploit the high sensitivity and broad bandwidth of the UWL receiver. We are collaborating with the MeerKAT Double Pulsar Timing team to optimise combination of MeerKAT and UWL data.",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2011 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries and covers each year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for LGAs and Victoria in Future Small Areas (VIFSA) for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups) and households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take into account current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\n2015 (a). - Data for 2015 has been estimated.\n\n",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 1. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The Timor Sill deepwater mooring was first deployed on 2011-06-13 at (9.28 S, 127.36 E) in the Indonesian Throughflow.\n\nInstrumentation includes 150 kHz and 75kHz ADCPs, Seabird SBE39s, discrete current meters and Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES).\n\nThe mooring provides profile velocity data above 500m and point source velocity between 500m and 1200m (depth of controlling sill). Temperature and salinity data are collected for the entire water column.\n\nThe aim of IMOS Indonsian Throughflow moorings (Indoflow) is to sustainably and directly measure the leakage of Pacific thermocline and intermediate waters from the western equatorial Pacific into the South Indian Ocean. The Indonesian Passages represent an important 'choke point' of the global ocean overturning circulation and the climate system. The interannual to decadal variability of the size and depth distribution of the flow through this choke point remains a troublesome unknown. In particular, changes in this flow will reflect long term changes in the Pacific and Indian Ocean wind fields, particularly any change in the Walker Circulation, as predicted by coupled climate models forced by increasing Greenhouse Gas scenarios. Changes in the associated heat flux are also anticipated at the global oceans warm. The Indoflow array design is based on the more comprehensive INSTANT process study and is deemed the minimal required mooring array to monitor the Indonesian Throughflow. The Ombai Strait and Timor Passage Throughflow components comprise about 11Sv of the 14 Sv total interbasin exchange. The Indoflow array integrates with the AIMS NAOS shelf line, allowing estimates of the interbasin exchange to include the transport of very warm waters across the Australian North West Shelf. All moorings in the Timor Passage are located along a high precision swath line of the TOPEX/Jason satellite altimeter missions. These data will shed light on how best to exploit altimetric data over our shallow northern shelves, especially in data assimilating models.",

    "description": "The Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) is the single, national online database of security interests in personal property in Australia. Personal property generally includes all forms of property other than land, buildings and fixtures. Buyers can check the PPSR to see if the valuable second-hand goods they want to buy are debt-free and safe from repossession. Businesses selling on terms, such as retention of title or consignment, or leasing, renting or hiring out valuable goods can register their security interest on the PPSR. \r\n\r\nThis dataset was specially created by AFSA for GovHack 2016. It contains the number of new registrations on the PPSR by ANZSIC industry division and subdivision.\r\n\r\nAFSA sourced the Industry information from the Australian Business Register (ABR). To do this, AFSA used the Australian Company Number (ACN) to match records. To protect privacy, AFSA assigned each ACN a random number instead of showing the actual ACN.\r\n\r\nThis data is a subset of overall PPSR registrations created. It solely includes registrations created by organisational secured parties that have registered on the PPSR with an ACN. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to that guide for more information. For further inquiries, please email statistics@afsa.gov.au.\r\n",

Over 700 citizens participated in 53 events led by 90 volunteer ecologists and experts. It gave Melburnians the unique opportunity to work alongside professional and amateur naturalists to discover Melbourne's biodiversity and help to produce a list of species living in our city.\n\n\n\nThe City of Melbourne has analysed the data collected in past BioBlitzes and is now building a baseline dataset against which future changes in biodiversity can be measured and evaluated.",

The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2017 Primary Health Networks (PHN).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

    "description": "Data Notes\n\n\nClass size audits are conducted by CESE (Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation) in March each year. Audits were not conducted in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. \n\n\nData for 2020 should be treated with caution. The collection took place in March when schools were impacted by COVID-19, so fewer data checks were carried out.\n\n\nStudents attending schools for specific purposes (SSPs), students in support classes in regular schools and distance education students are excluded from average class size calculations.\n\n\nThe average class size for each grade is calculated by taking the number of students in all classes that a student from that grade is in (including composite/multi age classes) divided by the total number of classes that includes a student from that grade. This can result in a lower Kindergarten to Year 6 average class size than any individual year level.\n\n\nFrom 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.\n\n\nSchools change size, so data in Table 2 is not necessarily comparable to previous iterations in earlier fact sheets.\n\n\nData Source\nEducation Statistics and Measurement, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation. \nData quality statement\nThe Class Size Audit Data Quality Statement addresses the quality of the Class Size Audit dataset using the dimensions outlined in the NSW Department of Education's data quality management framework: institutional environment, relevance, timeliness, accuracy, coherence, interpretability and accessibility.

    "description": "This data was collected in December 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R0.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, December, 2011\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, December 12, 2011\n\nData was collected from 6th-10th of December.\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of male cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 11 top cancer groupings (bladder, colorectal, head and neck, kidney, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, pancreas, prostate and stomach) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned an SA4 category. The number of people who could not be assigned an SA4 category is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer mortality statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 6 top cancer groupings (colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin and pancreas) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a GCCSA. The number of people who could not be assigned a GCCSA is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

    "description": "Data Notes:\n\n\nEnrolments are from system extracts in April and are not mid-year census enrolments which are extracted in August.\n\n\nThe Family Occupation and Education Index (FOEI) is a school level index of educational disadvantage related to socioeconomic background. It has been selected as the basis of the equity loading for socio-economic background in the department's new Resource Allocation Model. FOEI is constructed from parental education and occupation information collected from student enrolment forms and recorded in the Enrolment Registration Number system. FOEI uses a statistical regression model to produce a weighted combination of school-level parental education and occupation variables based on the extent to which each variable uniquely predicts average school performance.\n\n\nPrevious publications of the Statistical Bulletin compared enrolments in DoE regions. From 2014 these geographies have been discontinued and replaced with a geographical structure based on the new ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Groups of ASGS Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries in NSW have been combined into 11 groups for reporting and publication of department data.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Annual Statistical Bulletin.

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Hunter catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

    "title": "Summaries of AFMA log book data on effort distribution for Commonwealth fisheries in the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone",
    "description": "This data set contains summaries of AFMA log book data on effort distribution for Commonwealth fisheries in the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (excluding Cocos and Christmas Islands, Norfolk Island and the Sub-Antarctic Fisheries). The logbook data has been recorded and submitted to AFMA by commercial fishers. The data has been aggregated to produce summaries of total effort by gear type (summarised across fishery), over 5 year periods and at a 0.1 degree resolution where 5 boats or more operate. All effort information has been removed for areas where less than 5 boats operate and these areas are mapped to a 1 degree resolution. \nThe 5 years periods (1996-2000, 2001-2005 and 2006-2010) correspond to State of Environment (SoE) Reporting, required under the EPBC Act 1999. The most recent reporting period (2011-14) is a four year period. Each is labelled by the years aggregated (ie 2001-2005) and the gear type (ie LLP = long line pelagic). The gear codes and aggregated fisheries and the shape file field descriptions are listed below.\nNotes: \n1. Care needs to be taken when interpreting the fishing effort maps because in areas where there are less than 5 boats operating only the fishing footprint is displayed, consistent with the AFMA Information Disclosure Policy. The fishing footprint indicates that fishing occurred but does not provide information about the intensity of effort (number of operations etc). \n2. Legal fishing by foreign flagged vessels occurred in the 1980s and early 1990s in the Australian Fishing Zone. These are shown as areas of higher effort in (i) trawl maps prior to 1990 north of Arnhem Land and (ii) pelagic longline maps up until 1997 south of Tasmania.\n3. Minor line was historically recorded as a method in some of AFMA’s daily fishing logbooks, but is not in AFMAs current fishery logbooks. Minor line means trolling, or fishing using a rod or reel, handline or pole.\n4. Trawl effort maps are missing Torres Strait Prawn Fishery data prior to 2004.\n5. Gillnet effort maps prior to 1996 are not included due to data incompleteness.\n6. Jigging data is currently incomplete and is not included.\n7. Three records of Danish Seine were misreported (between 1996 and 2010) in the area of the Great Barrier Reef and have been removed.\n8. Minor line was historically recorded as a method in some of AFMA’s daily fishing logbooks, but is not in AFMAs current fishery logbooks. Minor line means trolling, or fishing using a rod or reel, handline or pole.\n9. Disclaimer:\nThe data provided by AFMA may contain errors or be incomplete.

Reporting to the standard allows cities to compare their service delivery and quality of life to other cities globally. The City of Melbourne was one on 20 cities to, globally to help pilot this program and is one of sixteen cities to receive the highest level of accreditation (platinum). \n\nHaving an international standard methodology to measure city performance allows the City of Melbourne to share data about practices in service delivery, learn from other global cities, rank its results relative to those cities, and address common challenges through more informed decision making. \n\nIndicators include: Fire and emergency response; Governance; Health; Recreation; Safety; Shelter; Solid Waste; Telecommunications and Innovation; Transportation; Urban Planning; Wastewater; Water and Sanitation; Economy; Education; Energy; Environment; and Finance.\n\nCity of Melbourne also submitted an application for accreditation, on behalf of ‘Greater Melbourne’, to the World Council on City Data and this resulted in an ‘Aspirational’ accreditation awarded to wider Melbourne. \n\nA summary of Melbourne's results is available here (http://open.dataforcities.org/). Visit the World Council on City Data’s Open Data Portal to compare our results to other cities from around the world.",

In the north-west of the State flooding is most likely to be caused by the summer monsoon or tropical cyclones while floods in the south-west are more likely to occur in response to heavy winter rainfalls.\n\nWhile historical flood records and information extend as far back as 1830, detailed information on peak flood levels is typically limited to the last few decades.\n\nThis dataset shows the area of inundation (polygons), i.e., the floodplain area that has occurred during the major flood events in Western Australia.\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the historical flood mapping, 3 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Historical Flood Levels (m AHD)\nFPM Historical Extent of Flooding\nFPM Historical Floodplain Area\n\nThe major flood events that are covered in this dataset are:\n\nBow Bridge Townsite (June 1988)\nCorrigin Townsite (January 1982)\nEsperance Townsite (January 2007)\nKupungarri to Willare (including Dales Yard &amp; Mount Joseph gauging stations) - Fitzroy River (January 2023) \nLake Grace Townsite (January 2006)\nMerredin Townsite (February 1979)\nPerth (February 2017)\nTambellup Townsite (January 1982)\nWarmun Aboriginal Community (March 2011)\nYork Townsite (July 2021, August 2022)\n\nOther major flood events that have occurred in the past include:\n\nBlackwood River (1945, 1955, 1963, 1964, 1982)\nCollie River (1945, 1963, 1964, 1974, 1982)\nFitzroy River (1983, 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002, 2011)\nGascoyne River (1960, 1961, 1980, 1995, 2000, 2010)\nGreenough River (1888, 1927, 1953, 1971, 1988, 1999, 2006)\nMoore River (1934, 1955, 1961, 1995, 1999)\nMurray River (1862, 1945, 1955, 1964)\nPreston River (1964, 1967, 1974, 1983, 1990, 2011)\nSwan River (1862, 1872, 1945, 1955, 1964, 1983)\n\nThe historical flood information is used in the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation's floodplain management activities to ensure that floodplains are managed for the benefit of the whole community, minimising the risk and damages and protecting environmental values.\n\nFloodplain mapping datasets and floodplain development strategies for rivers and major watercourses in Western Australia are also available from the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation.\n\nGLOSSARY:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

A building footprint is a 2D polygon (or multi-polygon) representation of the base of a building or structure. The footprint is defined as the boundary of the structure where the walls intersect with the ground plane or podium, rather than an outline of the roof area (roofprint).\n\nWhere a building has a significant change in built form, multiple footprint polygons are ‘stacked’ vertically to define shape of the built form. This includes, and is not limited to:\n\n- Tower\n- Podium\n- Setbacks/offsets\n\nThe Australian Height Datum (AHD) is the national vertical datum for Australia. The National Mapping Council adopted the AHD in May 1971 as the datum to which all vertical control mapping would be referred\n\nThe data was captured in May 2020.",

    "description": "<b>Version 1 February 2016</b>\nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Caboolture West Local Plan and  North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nThis dataset contains 14 national surfaces, represented by 1km grids, relating\nto the cost of salinity damage to local infrastructrure. The infrastructure\ncost impacts are limited to those that occur at the location of salinity\nproblem, downstream and other offsite impacts are not covered. All dollar\nvalues are given in 1996/97 Australian dollars. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Total cost ($) to all infrastructure (buildings, road, rail and\nbridges) based on the low, abesta and high estimates of the impact of the\ncurrent (2000) extent of salinity.2. Total cost ($) to all infrastructure\n(buildings, road, rail and bridges) based on the low, abesta and high\nestimates of the impact of predicted 2020 extent of salinity3. Total cost ($)\nthe general infrastructure component (buildings etc., derived from population)\nas the abesta estimate of the impact of the current (2000) extent of\nsalinity.4. Total cost ($) the general infrastructure component (buildings\netc., derived from population) based on the abesta estimate of the impact of\nthe predicted 2020 extent of salinity5. Total cost ($) the road component of\ninfrastructure based on the abesta estimate of the impact of the current\n(2000) extent of salinity.6.

Three assumption series are referred to, which are informed by data from the past four Censuses - series I (no change in living arrangement propensity), series II (historical trend gradually plateauing) and series III (historical trend continuing). These projections are not forecasts or predictions. Non-demographic factors such as economic conditions may affect future household and family formation, but have not been explicitly taken into account in these projections. ",

The AUV was equipped with a multibeam echo sounder, side scan sonar and sub bottom profiler, plus a HD camera system utilised during the small scale surveys over a further six selected areas within the 11 main target areas initially surveyed.\n\nHigh resolution bathymetry, backscatter and sidescan sonar data was collected along with photographic imagery of the seafloor.  Track lines of the areas surveyed were also produced.\n\nA zip of the track lines (ESRI shapefiles) can be accessed and downloaded via the Distribution links below.",

Large swell at some sites meant that the vehicle was being moved around a lot leading to some patchy holes in the meshes, predominantly at the Rottnest site.  The  information available to help plan dive locations became less detailed as the deployments moved further north.  The dives at the Abrolhos were planned using simple nautical charts and featured more sand and coral than kelp. It would be useful to secure multibeam surveys in the region to help plan future dives",

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of live-born babies at or after term with an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes for births at or after term. This has been calculated with the number of live-born babies at or after term (from 37 completed weeks gestational age) with an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes, divided by the number of live-born babies born at or after term (from 37 completed weeks gestational age), and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more. If the baby is alive the birth is a live birth. If the baby is not alive the birth is a stillbirth.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks. The term is defined as gestational age between 37 and 41 weeks.\n\n\nBirths included are live-born babies born at or after term.\n\n\nBirths excluded are stillbirths and babies born before term (before 37 weeks).\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The data is based on modified 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2004.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2005 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The goal of this project was to gain a regional understanding of the geomorphology of the Kimberley coral reefs, including their interaction with different substrates, morphological patterns, distribution and relative exposure to terrestrial and other impacts. The most cost effective way to determine reef growth architecture is through shallow seismic surveys which will provide information on foundations, previous reef growth events and Holocene buildup, also providing site survey data for collection of Holocene cores. The Holocene reef record will be obtained by coring selected sites, to gain an understanding of sea levels and growth history responses, timing of events during the Holocene, reef building communities, resilience and climate change responses. This involved addressing the following:\n\nIn summary, our objectives were: \n\n- Use remote sensing with limited ground truth checking to establish the regional geomorphology, growth patterns and substrates of the inshore Kimberley reefs;\n- Determine the seismic architecture of selected Kimberley reefs as part of an assessment of Holocene reef growth and relation to antecedent foundations to assess reef growth;\n- Obtain a Holocene record of sea level change, reef building communities, chronology and growth patterns and climate history of selected inshore reefs for comparison with the short term record, where suitable coral material is obtained; \n- Where possible, quantify reef flat elevations, reef topography and morphology.\n\nPrior to commencement of acquisition of field data in 2013 time was invested in examining technical, equipment and logistic issues presented for SBP surveys and collection of coral reef cores for the remote and “tidally challenged” operational activities that will be required by this project. This is important also for site selection, which to some extent was dependent on other Kimberley project activities and priorities, and on ongoing discussions within WAMSI and with Industry groups. \n\nOre pit mapping fieldwork was undertaken on a Holocene reef exposed in a mining pit on Cockatoo Island in July 2013 and a paper published on the findings in Marine Geology in 2015. In October 2013 SBP fieldwork was successfully completed and analysis of the data completed. Collection of cores was completed in October 2014, where possible, in the same locations as the SBP, all cores were been logged and sampled and samples sent for dating, dating results for all reefs, except Adele Reef, have been received. The ‘ReefKIM’ database has mapped more than 800 reefs and 30 analysed in detail.\n\nData is stored at Pawsey Supercomputing Centre on 'WA Node Ocean Data Network' project under 'WAMSI2 > KMRP > 1.3 > 1.3.1'.  There are seven main folders:\n1) 000 Reports  2) 001 Metadata  3) 002 ReefKIM Database  4) 003 Reef Coring  5) 004 Cockatoo Island  6) 005 Seismic  7) 006 Papers.  Detail of folders is available via '1.3.1_Folder_Structure.pdf' which is attached to this metadata record.",

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\nJP - 2050 RCP 4.5 – Juvenile period as years until 50% of individuals in the population have \nflowered under future conditions (30-year period centred on 2050) with the RCP 4.5 emissions \nscenario based on a model featuring annual precipitation. (Fig 5 b) \nJP - 2× 2050 RCP 4.5 - Juvenile period as 2× years until 50% of individuals in the population have flowered under future conditions (30-year period centred on 2050) with the RCP 4.5 emissions \nscenario based on a model featuring annual precipitation.

The results show that with a stochastic environment an optimal-sized marine reserve can generate a triple payoff that (a), raises the resource rent even when harvesting is 'optimal', (b) decreases the recovery time for the biomass to return to its former state and smooths fishers' harvests and resource rents, and (c), lowers the chance of a catastrophic collapse following a negative shock.",
