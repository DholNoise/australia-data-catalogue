    "description": "Coastal ocean surface radar is a land-based technique which uses scattering from the rough sea surface to obtain echoes which are Doppler shifted by the dynamics of the sea.  It has been shown (Crombie, 1955) that the scatter is predominantly a Bragg interaction between the radio wave and the sea surface gravity wave that is propagating in the same direction and with half the wavelength of the radio wave.  This Bragg interaction gives two strong first-order lines in the echo spectrum; one from the resonant gravity wave moving radially away from the station, and one from the resonant gravity wave moving towards the station.\n\nDirection-finding systems determine the azimuthal direction of a source point by comparing amplitude and phase signals on crossed loop receive antennas. The direction finding calculation is done on Doppler shift spectra for a specified range which includes return echoes from all azimuths.  This means that the spectra are spread and second-order echoes from one direction are swamped by the first-order echoes from other directions.  Consequently, parameter extraction using second-order echoes is not possible on a routine basis.  Directional wave spectra at the location of each radar station are produced by analysing the full azimuthal spread of first-order echo amplitudes, and wind directions are derived across the grid points by taking the ratio of the positive and negative Bragg echoes.\n\nSeaSonde HF ocean radar stations are used on the Turquoise Coast (Seabird and Cervantes), Western Australia, and on the Bonney Coast (Nora Creina and Blackfellows Cave), South Australia.",

The survey locations were selected based on the Liveable Green Network, such as locations of interest or where change is occurring or expected.  For more information on walking count sites, visit the City of Sydney website.",

    "description": "We request time to observe 270 pulsars on a regular basis in order to achieve three main science goals. The first is to understand pulsars: how do they spin down and what disrupts this process, how and why their profiles vary with time, whether they precess or have planetary mass companions, in short all the things that make pulsar timing noisier than the perfect clock. Secondly we want to understand the interstellar medium of our Galaxy through repeated monitoring of dispersion measure, rotation measure and flux density variations in conjunction with scintillation parameters. Finally, we provide these data as a community service both to the high-energy community where we have strong collaborative links (particularly to Fermi) and to the radio pulsar astronomers generally through the CSIRO archive. The project is on-going since 2007, we are (co-)authors on 106 papers arising from the P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of students from Bordeaux, Manchester, Oxford, Stanford, and Swinburne. We are seeking long-term project status with a view to continuing the project into the SKA era.",

    "description": "PSR J1227-6208 is a recycled pulsar in a bianry with a massive white dwarf companion. A recent timing measurement from combined MeerKAT and Parkes observations shows the companion mass to be between 1.2 and 1.5 $M_\\odot$, very close to the Chandrasekhar, resulting in potential profound physical implications. However, the timing precision is limited by the DM timing noise. We propose regular monitoring of this pulsar with the Parkes UWL receiver in conjunction with MeerKAT observations during the following four years. The joint monitoring will significantly improve the constraints on the Post-Keplerian parameters, with Parkes observations contributing to constrain the DM noise due to its large frequency bandwidth. These observations will be added to the already existing 11-year-long timing baseline, of which the later 5 years already include high-precision MeerKAT data and Parkes UWL data. After four years of further timing with the inclusion of UWL observatiosn, we predict an uncertainty on the masses smaller than 0.01 solar masses based on simulations. If UWL is not included, the mass uncertanites may saturate on their current values.",

It shows number of jobs and number of business establishments by business size, classified by their CLUE industry, ANZSIC1 and CLUE small area allocation.\nBusiness size is determined by the total number of jobs at ech business establishment and is categorised as follows:\nNon employing, no jobs allocated to the establishment.Small business, 1 to 19 jobs employed at a business establishment.Medium business, 20 to 199 jobs employed at a business establishment.Larger business, 200 or more jobs employed at a business establishment.\nThis dataset has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The 'City of Melbourne' row totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.Non-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement.

The data has been joined with LGA 2011 boundaries. \nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nEGM Numbers: a venue may be operating less machines than its licensed or attached numbers\n\n\nGaming Machine Density calculations are based on operating gaming machines with attached entitlements divided by adult population divided by 1,000 (gaming machines per 1,000 adults).\n\n\nExpenditure / EGM: Refers to the average Expenditure per Gaming Machine. In 2013, these figures are based on net expenditures divided by number of gaming machines with attached entitlements.\n\n\nSEIFA Scores: a lower score indicates that an area is relatively disadvantaged compared to an area with a higher score. Scores should only be used in distributive analysis. Rankings are based on highest score, for example 1st ranking in index of disadvantage means the LGA is least disadvantaged.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Care must be taken in using any figures for an LGA involving net expenditure and population. The expenditure per person in an LGA may include an amount of expenditure coming from persons not living within the LGA.\n\n",

Both measures have been calculated with the numerator as the total number of eligible presentations and the denominator as the estimated resident population as at 30 June at the beginning of the reporting period. The data spans the financial years 2013-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIn-hours ED attendances include attendances where the patient presented to a public hospital ED on weekdays on or after 8am and before 8pm, or Saturdays on or after 8am and before 1pm (excluding public holidays). Attendances were included if the patient was assigned a triage category of 3 (urgent), 4 (semi-urgent) or 5 (non-urgent), was not subsequently admitted to hospital and had an 'emergency presentation' type of visit.\n    After-hours ED attendances include attendances where the patient presented to a public hospital ED on weekdays before 8am or on or after 8pm, Saturdays before 8am or on or after 1pm, or any time on Sundays and public holidays. Attendances were included if the patient was assigned a triage category of 3 (urgent), 4 (semi-urgent) or 5 (non-urgent), was not subsequently admitted to hospital and had an 'emergency presentation' type of visit.\n\n        For further information about this dataset, visit the data source:[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Use of emergency department and GP services, 2013-14 to 2015-16 Data Tables](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/hospitals/use-emergency-department-gp-services-2015-16/data)\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for SA3s 11002, 20301, 20303, 20505, 30101, 30102, 31901 for 2013-2014, 10902, 11002, 20301, 20303, 20505, 21002, 30101, 30102, 30601, 31901 for 2014-2015, and 10104, 10902, 11002, 20303, 20505, 30101, 30102, 31901 for 2015-2016 should be interpreted with caution, reported data includes 90-95% of public hospital emergency service presentations for residents in these area.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who felt their GP always or often spent enough time in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Article released in the Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resources Economics January 2018. Cite as: Sheng, Y, Jackson, T and Lawson, K ,2018, Evaluating the benefits from transport infrastructure in agriculture: a hedonic analysis of farmland prices. Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics. doi:10.1111/1467-8489.12243 \r\n\r\n Access to transport infrastructure generates a range of benefits to the agriculture sector; many of which are difficult to measure directly. In this study, we use hedonic regression analysis of farm-level data to examine the contribution of transport infrastructure to the value of farmland traded between 2009 and 2011 through its impact on farm productivity. \r\n\r\n We show that a one per cent of reduction in the cost of transportation between farms and ports leads to a 0.33 per cent increase in land prices, and there is no significant difference between rail and road transportation at the aggregate level. Moreover, the benefits generated by particular types of infrastructure services vary between industries and with farm size, suggesting there are multiple channels through which public infrastructure influences agricultural production. Our findings help to inform future investment decisions in Australia and in other countries by providing new evidence regarding the benefits of existing transport infrastructure. ",

    "description": "Natural or native molecular hydrogen (H2) can be a major component in natural gas, and yet its role in the global energy sector’s usage as a clean energy carrier is not normally considered. Here, we update the scarce reporting of hydrogen in Australian natural gas with new compositional and isotopic analyses of H2 undertaken at Geoscience Australia. The dataset involves ~1000 natural gas samples from 470 wells in both sedimentary and non-sedimentary basins with reservoir rock age ranging from the Neoarchean to Cenozoic. Pathways to H2 formation can involve either organic matter intermediates and its association with biogenic natural gas or chemical synthesis and its presence in abiogenic natural gas. The latter reaction pathway generally leads to H2-rich (&gt;10 mol% H2) gas in non-sedimentary rocks. Abiogenic H2 petroleum systems are described within concepts of source-migration-reservoir-seal but exploration approaches are different to biogenic natural gas. Rates of abiogenic H2 generation are governed by the availability of specific rock types and different mineral catalysts, and through chemical reactions and radiolysis of accessible water. Hydrogen can be differently trapped compared to hydrocarbon gases; for example, pore space can be created in fractured basement during abiogenic reactions, and clay minerals and evaporites can act as effective adsorbents, traps and seals. Underground storage of H2 within evaporites (specifically halite) and in depleted petroleum reservoirs will also have a role to play in the commercial exploitation of H2. Estimated H2 production rates from water radiolysis in mafic-ultramafic and granitic rocks and serpentinisation of ultramafic-mafic rocks gives a H2 inferred resource potential between ~1.6 to ~58 MMmH3y-1 for onshore Australia down to a depth of 1 km. The prediction and subsequent identification of subsurface H2 that can be exploited remains enigmatic and awaits robust exploration guidelines and targeted drilling for proof of concept.\n\nAppeared in The APPEA Journal 61(1) 163-191, 2 July 2021",

The researchers will examine the environmental factors that influence the establishment and persistence of wildlife diseases in the region. They will study insect disease vectors and the incidence of disease in birds in a range of habitats in order to identify where disease risk is greatest. Field studies will be conducted using replicated mosquito trapping and mist netting of birds in Torres Strait, at sites identified from previous projects.  \nOutcomes include:\n\n1. Developing a model of disease dynamics across the Torres Strait based on past and ongoing epidemiology and ecological studies on vectors, reservoir hosts and known disease prevalence including the influence of inter-island and PNG traffic on insect vectors.\n\n2. Undertake a fieldwork program that tests and improves upon our understanding (the model) of how diseases are maintained and dispersed across the islands.\n\n3. Use the results to identify appropriate responses for minimizing the risks associated with disease incursion.\n\n4. Develop capacity in north Queensland in the identification and sampling of vectors and diseases",

In total 39 samples were collected from a range of hydrogeological settings in two field campaigns. One field campaign focussed on obtaining groundwater samples from bores drawing groundwater from Eromanga Basin and overlying Lake Eyre Basin (LBWCo (2020), Dataset 1). Reservoir water samples were collected by petroleum companies on behalf of the GBA program (Dataset 2). Where possible the samples were clustered to provide hydrochemical information at various depths. The locations of Bore that were sampled are outlined in Figure 3.  The sample dataset (Dataset 3, and Dataset 4) is comprised of: – Sixteen from shallow sub-artesian aquifers either the Winton Formation or the Cenozoic Lake Eyre Basin (bores less than 100 m deep). – Thirteen deep GAB bores (sample depths from 1100 to 2070 m). – Ten samples from petroleum wells producing from deep hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Cooper and Eromanga basins.  Hydrochemical analyses include: field parameters, major and minor ions, hydrocarbons, as well as environmental groundwater tracers. Environmental groundwater tracers include; Strontium isotopes, noble gases including 4He, stable isotopes of water, stable isotopes of hydrogen and carbon from methane, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), as well as radioactive tracers - tritium (3H),  Carbon 14 (14C) and Chloride 36 (36Cl).  Further infromation can be found in factsheet 10 available from https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/gba.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nSampling of aquifers in Eromanga Basin (GAB) and Lake Eyre Basin (Cenozoic) was undertaken by a contractor (LBWCO Pty Ltd) in October 2020. CSIRO sampled 6 GAB bores in November 2019. Samples from production wells were collected by companies on behalf of GBA.  Locations were determined using GPS at time of sampling.",

    "description": "Regional land supply assessments measure the stocks of land for future residential, industrial and commercial uses. It provides context for the land use planning and infrastructure provision required to meet demand across selected regional centres in Western Australia. Regional land supply assessments are prepared by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage (the Department) on behalf of the Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC) to fulfil the requirements for tracking and monitoring land supply, as outlined in section 14 of the Planning and Development Act 2005. The role of WAPC include monitoring and forecasting land supply throughout Western Australia, developing strategies for the timely supply of affordable residential land, and researching and developing planning methods and models relating to land use planning, land development and associated matters. \n\nRegional land supply assessments are one of a suite of products produced as part of the Urban Development Program (UDP). The UDP monitors land supply and promotes the timely delivery of residential, industrial and commercial land in Western Australia. The information presented in regional land supply assessments assist State Government agencies, utility and essential service providers, local governments and the private sector in decision making and forward planning. \n\nRegional land supply assessments include key information on:\n•   demand drivers specific to each regional centre, including the major economic factors that influence employment and population growth, and therefore, the demand for land and housing\n•   zoned land supply for residential (including rural living), industrial and commercial uses\n•   development constraints\n•   recent and future land development activity\n•   existing and required physical infrastructure. \n\nThis spatial dataset shows sites/areas that have been identified for future residential, industrial or commercial development. Sites are included where intent has been demonstrated by Government or the development industry to develop the site at some point in the future. Sites are included based on the current, applicable planning framework at the time of capture/analysis. ",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "The Flowery Gully Limestone Deposit, twenty miles north of Launceston, was surveyed in detail to delineate the most suitable portions for supplying limestone to the Australian Aluminium Production Commission's plant at Bell Bay, five miles to the north east across the Tamar Estuary. Basic requirements for the limestone were that it lie in an area suitable for quarrying and have as low a silica and magnesium carbonate content as possible so that it could be used efficiently in the aluminium extraction process. The preliminary reconnaissance revealed a stratigraphical chemical control and it was found possible to divide the section measuring 1,700 feet in true thickness into three stratigraphical zones, the topmost of which contains the purest limestone and is most suitable for Bell Bay; the middle zone contains isolated areas of high quality stone. The more detailed survey to reveal quarryable stone in these two zones defined one major and one minor deposit in the upper zone and one minor deposit in the middle. These three deposits contain indicated and inferred reserves totalling 1,000,000 tons; of this figure 100,000 tons has an average grade of 0.4% silica and 5.7% magnesium carbonate and the remainder has a grade not exceeding 0.5% silica and 4% magnesium carbonate. The investigation of the depositional environment revealed quiet and consistent conditions of deposition, which information was used to indicate possible areas for exploration for additional reserves when necessary. Numerous bedded chert nodules are present in the high-silica-content areas of the middle zone. The origin of the silica of this zone was investigated chemically and petrologically, but the results were inconclusive. It was discovered however that practically all silica was syngenetic. It is now mainly in the form of quartz grains and in smaller amounts as a component of the small percentage of clay present; however where chert nodules are present the silica of the cherts is in the form of chalcedony. Areas of marked dolomitization were noted, particularly in the upper and middle zones; they probably represent algal reefs (stromatoporoid bioherms). One of them had a lateral extent of at least 1,600 feet. A distinct disconformity was revealed by the detailed mapping at the top of the limestone section.",

    "description": "<b>Version 20 June 2016</b> \n\n(Overlay Dataset 1 of 4, needs to be used in conjunction with lines, polygons and North Lakes Locality datasets).\n\nThe Infrastructure Buffers Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Isotopic values for 18-O and 13-C were obtained from Globigerinoides ruber and correlated with the SPECMAP age-model. Radiocarbon dating of Globigerinoides sacculifer was also undertaken at nine sample depths, and then corrected and correlated with the curve. This yielded an age vs. depth profile from which it was possible to determine approximate sedimentation rates. From the age-model we see the evidence of MIS 1 through to 5a with sedimentation rates ranging from 2 cm/kyr to 20 cm/kyr, with an average of 10cm/kyr. This is a high sedimentation rate for a sedimentary basin, however the core is situated on the increased slope of the Capricorn Channel, therefore sediments scoured off the shallow gradient slope above may feasibly be focused at this depth on the slope. The sedimentation rate exhibits a unorthodox pattern, with a very high rate (25 cm/kyr) during the middle of MIS 3.",

    "description": "Kwinana is a major heavy industrial area 30 km south of Perth, Western Australia. Most industry is concentrated in a strip of land about eight kilometres long bordering the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the late 1970s emissions of sulfur dioxide from Kwinana industries caused significant pollution in nearby residential areas. The almost universal conversion to natural gas in 1984 virtually eliminated sulfur dioxide emissions associated with fuel combustion. However, with growth in demand and the cost of natural gas, plus the increase in sulfur dioxide emissions from other sources, the Environmental Protection Authority recognised the potential for the air quality around Kwinana to again become degraded and therefore established an Environmental Protection Policy (EPP) in 1992 to maintain acceptable air quality.\n\nThe Kwinana EPP was formally reviewed in 1999 and re-issued unchanged. The 1992 Regulations are still in force along with a 1999 amendment regulations. The EPP provides for a redetermination of industrial emissions limits as and when required, e.g. to accommodate new industries or variations to existing industry emissions.\n\nThe Policy defines three areas (Areas A, B and C), where:\n\nArea A is the area of land on which heavy industry is located;\n\nArea B is a buffer area surrounding industry;\n\nArea C is beyond Areas A and B, predominantly rural and residential.\n\nSulfur dioxide standards and limits were set for the three areas, increasing in stringency from Area A to Area C. The most important of these with respect to controlling air quality are the standards and limits averaged over 1-hour. Similarly, ambient standards and limits were established for total suspended particulates.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "SE Queensland – Moreton Island (Babcock): Dive sites were selected inside and outside of a green zone offshore of Moreton Island.  A broad grid was completed at each site and three dense grids completed in each of the depth bands 15‐20m, 20‐25m and 25‐30m.  There was insufficient ship time available to deploy at other sites in the region where kelp has been documented, including in deeper waters and further north. Sites for targeted dredging, sub-bottom profiling and AUV imaging were then selected for detailed study of particular features.  \n\nAll activities were undertaken during a 21-day cruise aboard the R/V Southern Surveyor, Australia's Marine National Facility operated by CSIRO. \n\nThe study of these structures may yield insights regarding potential future sea level changes and their potential impact on sensitive reef areas such as the GBR.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 6 top cancer groupings (colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin and pancreas) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a GCCSA. The number of people who could not be assigned a GCCSA is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nDefinition:Mean annual deep drainage. This is the amount of water draining\nbelow the root zone.Interpretation:Significant deep drainage is confined to\nirrigation areas, and wet areas where rainfall exceeds potential evaporation\nat least for some months of the year: the southeast (including Tasmania), over\nthe eastern ranges and in the north.Deep drainage has a broadly similar\npattern to runoff, though with added variability through the influence of soil\ntexture.Notes: rule-based method is used to estimate the rate of deep\ndrainage on the basis of soil texture, with modification to account for\ncultivation and irrigation.For this quantity, results are given for the aBASEa\n(pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.The aAGRICa case includes\ncurrent agricultural inputs of water from irrigation.FWLeach.Agric a Mean\nannual deep drainage (mm y-1) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioFWLeach.Base a Mean annual deep drainage (mm y-1) in the aBASEa\n(pre-1788) scenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ddab_r9cl\n__02411a01.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information about this hemi-pelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile, the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core and the percentage of carbonate material in each sample. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \n\nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2008 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP3, a 6m steel pole, which has been installed at Orpheus Island on the central Great Barrier Reef. The sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions at Orpheus Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on Orpheus Island.\n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions.\n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Orpheus Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on Heron Island (southern GBR), One Tree Island (near by) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). A light sensor is also located on the Island itself to give measures of PAR.",

The Beetaloo GBA region non-development disturbance dataset contains all of the non-linear (see additional datasets listed below for linear features), ecological disturbances from existing publicly available datasets (see input dataset listed below). The dataset has been created for the purpose of quantifying baseline ecological disturbances for assessment of the exploration impact analysis.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe Lineage field lists the parents of this dataset. Points and line features were selected from various input layers and were checked against imagery in ArcMap 10.5 (ESRI basemap / Digital Globe* (Jan 2018) and Bing** (various 2015 to 2019)) to determine if they should be included and if a buffer should be added (e.g. a wind pump is a point feature, but the area around it has also been cleared (disturbed) and so the point was buffered to better represent the disturbance).

    "title": "Coastal Floodplain Prioritisation Study - Estuarine Tidal Hydrodynamic Models",
    "description": "The Coastal Floodplain Prioritisation Study is a product of the NSW Marine Estate Management Strategy (MEMS) developed by the University of NSW Water Research Laboratory (WRL). \nAs part of that Study, a finite element numerical hydrodynamic model (RMA-2) (King, 2015) was developed to simulate present day and future sea level rise hydrodynamics in each of the Tweed, Richmond, Clarence, Hastings, Macleay, Manning and Shoalhaven River estuaries. \nHydrodynamics is the study of water movement. In an estuary, three main elements control the movement of water (tidal hydrodynamics). This includes, estuary geometry, upstream catchment\ninflows and downstream ocean tides. The geometry of an estuary is defined by its width, length, depth or the shape and storage of sidearms. Upstream catchment inflows are based on rainfall and runoff and downstream tidal inflows are based on the water levels in the ocean. \nThe completed hydrodynamic tidal models adequately represent day-to-day variations to estuarine water levels using detailed bathymetry in the intertidal range, and calibrated over a long time period to capture different tidal conditions. The hydrodynamic models were calibrated to both water levels and flow (where possible). Calibration and verification periods varied between the seven (7) estuaries based on data availability. Information on the period of calibration and data used for calibration can be found in the appendix of each individual floodplain report.\nThe RMA-2 hydrodynamic model solves the shallow water wave equations and is suitable for the simulation of flow in vertically, well-mixed water bodies such as, estuaries. RMA-2 uses the principles of conservation of mass and momentum, and represents typical processes of bed and bank friction, turbulence and wind stress. \nThe hydrodynamic model for each estuary comprised of three (3) main inputs:\n\nChannel bathymetry;\nDownstream tidal water levels; and\nUpstream river flow.\n\nThe channel bathymetry was defined from existing hydro-survey datasets which had been collected for each estuary. 1-D elements were used to represent well defined channels in which the water levels remain ‘in bank’ and two dimensional 2-D elements were used to represent areas in which flow can occur in both the X and Y planes.\nOcean tidal water levels were based on MHL observations at the entrance of each estuary. Major upstream river flows were applied as inflow boundaries and were based on real-time streamflow\nobservations maintained by WaterNSW. Lower catchment floodplains inflows were not included in the modelling and were likely to have a proportionally minor influence on water level statistics near the areas of interest near the lower parts of the estuary.\nFurther information on the tidal hydrodynamic models are outlined in the Coastal Floodplain Prioritisation Study – Background and Methodology (Rayner et al., 2023) (i.e. the ‘Methods report’). Details of the specific inputs used for each estuaries’ model is included Appendix I of the relevant Study Appendices document (see references below).\nThe Estuarine Tidal Hydrodynamic Models for the following regions can be accessed as resources below:\n\nTweed River\nRichmond River\nClarence River\nHastings River\nMacleay River\nManning River\nShoalhaven River  \n\nLegal Constraints\nThe estuary Hydrodynamic Models available here are Copyright 2023 Department of Regional NSW.\nThey are Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use these files except in compliance with the License.

    "description": "Princess Royal Harbour was surveyed in January and March 2021.\nSeagrass species distribution (Posidonia australis, Posidonia sinuousa, Posidonia coriacea, Halophila sp., Ruppia sp., and Amphibolis sp.) and cover (as percentage cover classes: 0, &lt;15%, 15-45%, 45-75%, &gt;75%) was recorded across 263 observations points across the estuary. The type of meadow (continuous or patchy), epiphytic cover on seagrass (as none, very low, low, medium, high or very high), and macroalgae cover (as percentage cover in categories: 0, &lt;15%, 15-45%, 45-75%, &gt;75%) were recorded at each site. At approximately a third of the sites, physical \nwater profiles, secchi depth and photosynthetically active radiation (euphotic depth) were recorded. When observation locations were inaccessible by boat, sites were accessed from kayaks to make observations. \n\nThe datasets making up the seagrass survey data are:\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass - point dataset\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Extent - polygon showing presence/absence\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Cover - polygon showing % cover\n\nLayers:\n\n<code>PrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Jan_2021 \n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass points where Year = '2021'\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Extent_Jan_2021\n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass_Extent where Year = '2021'\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Cover_Jan_2021\n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass_cover points where Year = '2021'\n</code>",

The data has been aggregated to the 2011 Local Govenment Areas (LGA).\nThe breastfeeding rate is calculated as the number of mother's breastfeeding at discharge, at 2 weeks, at 3 months and at 6 months, as a percentage of the total number of registered infants aged 1-2 years (Classified as full or partial according to the World Health Organisation definitions).\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe original data has separated the \"East Gippsland\" LGA into specified hospitals, \"East Gippsland - ORH\" &amp; \"East Gippsland - GLCH\". These have been aggregated into one LGA to allow spatialisation.\n\n\nThe original data has separated the \"Wellington\" LGA into specified health centres, \"Wellington - YDHS\" &amp; \"Wellington - CGHS\". These have been aggregated into one LGA to allow spatialisation.\n\n\nBreastfeeding rates are based on the number of children being fully or partially breastfed at specific ages. Breastfeeding Rates for the reported year are calculated on the data sourced from the previous year. For example, rates reported in 2011-12 are based on 2010-11 breastfeeding figures.\n\n",

Modelled using CLIMEX.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nCLIMEX (Sutherst & Maywald 1985; Sutherst et al. 2007) is a modelling package that enables users to model the climatic potential distribution of organisms based primarily on their current distribution, through taking into consideration climate response information from other knowledge domains if this is available.\n\nCLIMEX is a dynamic model that integrates the weekly responses of a population to climate using a series of annual indices.  CLIMEX uses an annual growth index (GIA) to describe the potential for population growth as a function of soil moisture and temperature during favourable conditions, and up to eight stress indices (cold, wet, hot, dry, cold-wet, cold-dry, hot-wet and hot-dry) to determine the probability that the population can survive unfavourable conditions.  The growth and stress indices are calculated weekly and are then combined into an overall annual index of climatic suitability, the Ecoclimatic Index (EI), which gives an overall measure of the potential of a given location to support a permanent population of the species.  The Ecoclimatic Index (EI), ranges from 0 for locations at which the species is not able to persist to 100 for locations that are optimal for the species year round.\n\nCLIMEX is a bioclimatic model, relying on a database of climatic variables of long-term monthly precipitation totals, averages of minimum and maximum temperatures, and averages of relative humidity at 09:00 and 15:00 hours.  The historical climate dataset used for these analyses was the CliMond dataset (www.climond.org), with a spatial resolution of 10¿, using station records centred on 1975 (Kriticos et al. 2012).\n\nThe impacts of climate change on the potential for each species to grow or pose an invasion risk were explored using a climate scenario model for 2070 taken from the CliMond dataset (Kriticos et al. 2012).  The selected climate datasets were developed using the A1B emission scenario applied to the CSIRO Mk 3.0 global climate model. \n\nFor each species, we used parameter sets that were either published or which we have developed.\n\nThe CLIMEX parameters used in the model for Clidemia hirta are published in:\nBreadon R. C., Brooks S. J. & Murphy H. T. (2012) Biology of Australian Weeds: Clidemia hirta L.D.Don. Plant Protection Quarterly 27, 3-18.\n\nThe CLIMEX parameters used in the model for Hiptage benghalensis, Miconia calvescens, Miconia nervosa, Miconia racemose, Stevia ovata and Turbina corymbosa can be obtained by contacting the author.\n\nOther references:\n\nKriticos, D.

    "title": "Hornsby Local Government Area Vegetation Map Update, 2017. VIS_ID 5065",
    "description": "The Hornsby Vegetation Map 2017 provides current information on the native vegetation in the study area. Previous Hornsby Vegetation mapping was completed in 2008. There are substantial changes in the mapped polygons on the urban-bushland boundary based on the updated imagery and map rules. New mapping thresholds are designed to address Council’s information needs arising from new regulations governing vegetation management in NSW, in particular the 10/50 bushfire protection rule. These were developed in consultation with Council and tested in a trial area prior to mapping.\nThe map has been compiled using visual aerial photo interpretation of 2014 imagery and botanical review. New field work has included collect rapid floristic data at selected survey locations. The update incorporates other sources of field survey and vegetation mapping completed between 2008 and 2017. The map is approximately 1:25,000 scale.\nThe Hornsby Vegetation Map 2017 applies the existing, accepted vegetation classification established in Smith and Smith Hornsby Vegetation Map 2008 Update. Two updates are provided with the addition of a new code for mixed ‘urban native/ exotic’ patches (consistent with Sydney Metropolitan vegetation mapping that overlaps part of the study area (OEH 2015)) and an updated classification equivalence table necessitated by changes to NSW plant community types. Modified, predominantly native vegetation has been attributed with the closest, applicable native vegetation and denoted as disturbed. In areas identified as ‘urban native/ exotic’ the proportion of exotics is highly variable. Field validation is recommended to support land management decisions in these areas.\nThe 2017 map has identified 17,005 ha of vegetation including 664 ha of EEC and 653 ha of ‘urban native/ exotic’ vegetation in the study area. In addition, the map includes 231 ha of potential relictual EEC subject to field validation. A direct comparison of changes to vegetation extent between 2008 and 2017 are not possible due to differing map methods.\nAll maps have limitations and field validation is recommended for detailed site planning and to verify the presence of vegetation types, particularly communities or species listed under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1994 or Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1996. Air photo interpretation is limited to a ‘birds eye view’ and may not detect changes in vegetation composition observable from field survey. Approximately 21% of the map has been validated by current and previous authors.\nIt is recommended that the Hornsby Vegetation Map 2017 is reviewed after one year in circulation. This will provide an opportunity to collate user feedback and identify minor edits required and any major revisions arising. Changes to the NSW PCT database may be incorporated at that time.\nVIS_ID 5065",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts are peculiar micro-millisecond duration transients, which have been seen to be extragalactic in origin. Since their discovery, a dichotomy has emerged in their population. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others have not been seen to be repeating. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20180301A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. Additionally, FRB 20180301A has been seen to have interesting polarisation properties, such as a switch in the sign of RM, indicating a reversal in the magnetic field and a marked reduction in the linear polarisation fraction towards lower frequencies (depolarisation). The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed a temporal evolution in the dispersion measure (DM) of the source and tentative evidence for correlation in the DM and rotation measure (RM). The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour of the source. We propose regular monitoring of FRB 20180301A using UWL to model the magnetic field evolution, study its circumburst media using depolarisation behaviour, and constrain any correlation of DM and RM.",

Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in GIS and AMIS for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for start / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length that are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated in 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10 using Lidar survey data (contours).

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST032009.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, October 10, 2009\nArrived:  \tSydney, New South Wales, October 14, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The selected non-financial assets data are sourced from the RBA. These data relate to households only.\r\n\r\n‘Consumer durables’ are tangible assets, other than dwellings, that generally have a life of a year or more. These include motor vehicles, furnishings and other household equipment. The quarterly estimates of the market value of consumer durables owned by households are interpolated from annual data sourced from the ABS. The latest data are extrapolated from the most recent observation.\r\n\r\n‘Dwellings’ are considered to be private dwellings owned by households in all areas of Australia. These include houses, semi-detached dwellings, townhouses, terrace houses, flats, units and apartments. The market value of the stock of household dwellings is estimated by multiplying the dwelling stock by an Australia-wide mean dwelling price series. The dwelling stock is estimated by combining Census data and the number of new dwellings completed each quarter (sourced from the ABS) with an adjustment for estimated demolitions. The dwelling price series is constructed from a number of sources including RP Data/Rismark.\r\n\r\nThe financial assets and liabilities data are derived from ABS Cat No 5232.0, Tables 4 and 20. The sectoral classification is on a national accounts basis and differs slightly from that in the preceding tables. In particular, the household sector includes unincorporated enterprises and non-profit institutions serving households. Identified claims between transactors in the same sector are excluded. The data were upgraded in 2009 to comply with SNA08 standards and are only available back to June 1988.\r\n\r\n‘Reserves of life offices and pension funds’ are equal to total assets of life offices, superannuation funds and friendly societies, less liabilities of these institutions other than to policyholders and fund members. Ownership of these net assets is imputed to the household sector.\r\n\r\n‘Unfunded superannuation claims’ are liabilities of state, local and national governments to public sector employees in respect of unfunded retirement benefits.\r\n\r\n‘Loans from banks’ are taken directly from the asset side of Table 8 in the above ABS catalogue and exclude bills of exchange etc.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2016 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 342,475 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2016 car parking event data there are 4,346 records where the parking event goes into 2017 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.07GB, 34.1 million rows)",

DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC14) was collected from a depth of 2004 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Isotopic values for 18-O and 13-C were obtained from : Globigerinoides ruber and correlated with the SPECMAP age-model. It appears that the core extends back to MIS 3 (Marine Isotope Stage). From limited depth matching with the Martinson et al. (1987) SPECMAP age-model it is extremely difficult to determine a sedimentation rate, however, it exhibits a relatively uniform rate throughout the core of ~4cm/kyr. This is a fairly high sedimentation rate for a core this distal and abyssal.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of overnight admitted mental health-related separations and bed days, with and without specialised psychiatric care by patient location. Overnight admitted patient separations refers to those separations when a patient undergoes a hospital’s formal admission process, completes an episode of care, is in hospital for more than one day and ‘separates’ from the hospital. The data spans the financial year of 2015-2016 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collections in Australian hospitals. It includes demographic, administrative and length of stay data for each hospital separation. Clinical information such as diagnoses, procedures undergone and external causes of injury and poisoning are also recorded.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nRates are directly age-standardised.\n\n\nThe analysis of bed days presented in this table excludes those separations with a length of stay greater than 365 days.\n\n\nSeparations with a care type of Newborn (without qualified days), and records for Hospital boarders and Posthumous organ procurement have been excluded.\n\n\nIt is possible for patients to have multiple separations in any given reference period.\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC13) was collected from a depth of 1482 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. The smallest size fraction (<100µm) dominates at all depths. Peaks in the larger grainsize fractions correlate with pteropod accumulations in the sediment, especially in the lower half of the core at 260cm and 290cm. The absence of complete pteropods at the top of the core may be related to the fact that GC13 is presently situated below the aragonite lysocline. This suggests that the aragonite lysocline was probably deeper during the glacials.",

    "title": "EPA Victoria Groundwater Quality Restriction Use Zones (GQRUZ) - Location Polygons",
    "description": "Groundwater Quality Restricted Use Zones (GQRUZ) are areas where there has been historic groundwater pollution as a result of previous industrial or other activities. These zones have been subject to clean up in line with the relevant environmental standards. However, restrictions remain on what the water can be used for if it is extracted via a groundwater bore.\n\nA GQRUZ remains when attempts have been made to clean up the groundwater at the affected site, but full clean-up was not possible - as it is often difficult to remove 100 per cent of groundwater pollution. It also may be impractical to clean up groundwater to the level needed to restore it to its original condition. EPA then identifies restrictions that should remain on how the water can be used without further treatment.\n\nGQRUZ do not represent a comprehensive list of all sites where groundwater quality may not be suitable for use. Rather, they represent locations where EPA has formally recognised that groundwater is polluted, following site investigations under EPA's environmental audit program. Other sources of information on groundwater quality include EPA's Priority Sites Register, which lists sites which are currently undergoing clean-up under EPA's compliance and enforcement activities.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the GQRUZ data published. EPA will not be held liable or responsible for any errors, or for any loss incurred from reliance on this data. Further information about a GQRUZ can be found in the audit report for the selected site.\n\nThis dataset mirrors the GQRUZ data available on EPA's website interaction portal, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date data, go to EPA's website interaction portal.",

The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial years between 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient care data collection systems in Australian hospitals in each state and territory. The NHMD is based on data provided to the AIHW by state and territory health authorities for the National minimum data set (NMDS) for Admitted patient care.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData by PHN should be interpreted with caution due to variations in admission practices, and because patients may be hospitalised outside the PHN where they reside.\n\n\nThe quality of data provided for Indigenous status varies. Time-series analyses may also be affected by changes in the quality of Indigenous identification over time.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation.

    "description": "\n<b>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</b>\nRiver and Creek Flooding \nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\n\n\n\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside. \n\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i> Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions - with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage. \n<i>Purpose</i>: To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris. \n<i>Methodology:</i> Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations. <i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i> \n<i>Flood Height:</i> Indicates the\napproximate water surface level of potential inundation during a\ncomputer-modelled flood event, expressed in meters above mean sea level. This dataset\nrepresents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of\n0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i> The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year\n\n<i>Likelihood: UnlikelyAnnual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i>\n\n<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year</i>\nA very large and very unlikely flood event. Over a very long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 1,000 years.  Few people will ever witness an event of this size. When an event of this size is observed it is considered to be very exceptional. A river and creek flood event of similar size occurred in the middle reaches of the North Pine River during January 2011. Whilst very unlikely, it is possible for these events to occur.\n\n<i>Version Notes 3.1.0</i> - First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling.

The program targeted premises unable to access commercial metro-comparable services, particularly those living in remote parts of Australia.\r\n\r\nUnder the ABG, a metro-comparable broadband service was defined as any service that offered a minimum 512 kilobits per second download and 128 kilobits per second upload data speed, with three gigabytes per month data usage at a total cost of $2500 GST inclusive over three years (including installation and connection fees).",

    "description": "This data was collected in April/May2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1112V5.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania,  April 16, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  May 01, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset represents the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to contamination evaluated for unconfined aquifers in Fitzroy, based on the DRASTIC method (Aller et al. 1987). This semi-quantitative but spatially distributed method is especially suited for regional investigations with limited data availability. The DRASTIC index is calculated based on seven components: Depth to groundwater, net recharge, Aquifer media, soil media, topography (slope), impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer (Aller et al. 1987). Areas with unconfined aquifers or with shallow water tables receive a high index and, vice versa, area with fractured rock aquifers and deep water tables have a low index.\n\nFor the Pilbara region, based on the spatial distribution of index values, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered not possible if the drastic index is less than 100. In grid cells with DRASTIC index between 100 and 125, unconfined aquifer contamination due to spill at the surface is considered possible but not material. In areas with DRASTIC indices above 125, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at surface is considered material, so avoidance and mitigation strategies are considered.\n\nFurther information about the DRASTIC map and the development of this map is described in Holland et al. (2024) [Securing water for an emerging Australian hydrogen industry - Methods report].",

    "title": "Parent record: Vertical coherence of currents in Jervis Bay: Summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe fourth of these six experiments involved the  summer deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), moored in the central part of Jervis Bay (35o 05'S, 150o 44'E). An ADCP measures how fast water is moving across an entire water column. Anchored to the seafloor it can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. For this experiment, the ADCP was moored on the seabed, in a frame, with sensors looking upwards and approximately 0.5m above the seabed. \n\nOver the summer deployment, 13th December 1990 to 15th January 1991, the ADCP was set-up with a 15 minute sampling interval and currents were measured over 1m depth bins. Bin numbers and currents are referenced as a height above the seabed (due to the uncertainty in defining water depth because of tides and air pressure). As such Bin #1 is centered at 1.5m above the transducer face or 2.0m above the seabed. Bin #2 is centered at 3m above the seabed, Bin #3 at 4m and so on.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There is only one subsiduary records that directly relates to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree):\n30d0a700-1fc2-11dd-a7e7-00188b4c0af8",

Assets managed and / or owned privately, by other ACT Government Directorates or by the Federal Government may not be included.\n\nThe streetlight cables are overhead or buried underground and carry the electrical load to power the streetlight network. There are different types of cables based on the load required to power each streetlight thus higher voltage cables are generally encased in a thicker conduit. The cables are connected to a circuit which is controlled at a controller box. The dataset includes streetlight cables from ActewAGL’s database as of June 30th 2017 in addition to new cables that have been handed over to the ACT Government since then. \n\nAttributes include location description, suburb, ownership, maintained by, asset sub type (Overhead Cable, Underground Cable), cable type and conduit, voltage (LOW or HIGH), the status of the cable (ABANDONED or IN SERVICE), when it was installed and the reference information for the source of the data. The cable length is based off the spatial geometry of each feature. \n\nThese assets are captured and maintained in the TCCS asset database through the works as executed (WAE) handover process or field audits. The information available in this dataset may be incomplete and should not be solely relied upon as a search. Cable locations / alignments generally represent indicative routes rather than being survey accurate.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rates of children aged 1, 2 and 5 who were fully immunised. Fully immunised means a child has received the scheduled vaccinations according to age for hepatitis B (hepB); diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (DTPa); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); polio (IPV); pneumococcal, meningococcal C, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), and varicella. The data spans the years of 2012-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data was sourced from the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), which is administered by the Australian Government Department of Human Services. The AIR is a national register that records immunisations given to children to help parents and guardians keep track of their children’s immunisations.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Immunisation rates for children in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe AIR may underestimate coverage due to incomplete submission of immunisation records or the inclusion of children who no longer reside in an area but have not been updated on the register.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"NP\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nRows assigned a \"#\" in the \"Interpret with Caution\" column should be interpreted with caution as these area’s eligible population is between 26 and 100 registered children.\n\n",

    "description": "The overall aims were to provide data on the distribution of deep seabed habitats and fauna that are amenable to scientific hypothesis testing, can be immediately applied to marine resource management processes, and that enable strategic development of tools and techniques for understanding the processes that maintain deep sea biodiversity. This work was to support the process of NWR Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories, distribution maps and conservation values. Data will be collected at scientific reference sites from potential MPA areas that can be re-visited for monitoring purposes in the future. Sampling along environmental gradients (geographic range and depth) in this section of Australia's coast will also provide the opportunity to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses. Further refinement of predictive methods for identifying seabed habitat types, initially developed in temperate and cool-temperate environments, will be enabled by data collection from this tropical location in Australia. We intended to highlight the importance of this underlying science as a modern \"Voyage of Discovery\" given the likely significance of the findings in terms of Australia's biodiversity and its biogeography and evolution. (From Voyage Plan).  Sediment samples were divided into two samples: an elutrition sample for macroinvertebrates that was sent to Robin Wilson at MV for analysis and a sediment sample to be analysed by Geoscience Australia.",

    "description": "The annual NSW People Matter Employee Survey provides an important opportunity for almost 400,000 employees to have a say about their workplace and to help make the public sector a better place to work. The survey asks employees about experiences with their own work and working with their team, managers and the organisation. The public sector includes a wide range of services relating to health, education, transport, justice, family support, finance, planning, the environment, and many other areas. Employees provide services directly to the public or work behind the scenes in research, policy, programs, clerical, corporate, or other types of jobs.\nThe survey was co-ordinated by the Public Service Commission working in collaboration with public sector departments and agencies.",

    "description": "Please Note: As announced by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection on 25 June 2017, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) retired the paper-based Outgoing Passenger Cards (OPC) from 1 July 2017. The information previously gathered via paper-based outgoing passenger cards is now be collated from existing government data and will continue to be provided to users. Further information can be accessed here: http://www.minister.border.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/removal-of-the-outgoing-passenger-card-jun17.aspx.\r\n\r\nDue to the retirement of the OPC, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) undertook a review of the OAD data based on a new methodology. Further information on this revised methodology is available at: http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3401.0Appendix2Jul%202017?opendocument&tabname=Notes&prodno=3401.0&issue=Jul%202017&num=&view= \r\n\r\nA sampling methodology has been applied to this dataset. This method means that data will not replicate, exactly, data released by the ABS, but the differences should be negligible.\r\n\r\nDue to ‘Return to Source’ limitations, data supplied to ABS from non-DIPB sources are also excluded.\r\n\r\nOverseas Arrivals and Departures (OAD) data refers to the arrival and departure of Australian residents or overseas visitors, through Australian airports and sea ports, which have been recorded on incoming or outgoing passenger cards. OAD data describes the number of movements of travellers rather than the number of travellers. That is, multiple movements of individual persons during a given reference period are all counted.\r\nOAD data will differ from data derived from other sources, such as Migration Program Outcomes, Settlement Database or Visa Grant information.\r\nTravellers granted a visa in one year may not arrive until the following year, or may not travel to Australia at all. Some visas permit multiple entries to Australia, so travellers may enter Australia more than once on a visa.\r\nSettler Arrivals includes New Zealand citizens and other non-program settlers not included on the Settlement Database. The Settlement Database includes onshore processed grants not included in Settler Arrivals.\r\n\r\nThese de-identified statistics are periodically checked for privacy and other compliance requirements. The statistics were temporarily removed in March 2024 in response to a question about privacy within the emerging technological environment. Following a thorough review and risk assessment, the Department of Home Affairs has republished the dataset.\r\n",

It builds upon previous studies, particularly the 2021 Floodplain Risk Management Study (FRMS), and integrates lessons from the catastrophic 2022 flood events.\n\nThe FRMS study area comprises the urban areas of North Lismore, South Lismore, Central Lismore, and East Lismore. \n\nThe objective of the Lismore Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) is to provide a short- to medium-term strategy for managing flood risk in the Lismore Township. Specifically, the plan aims to:\n\nEstablish a comprehensive program of works and measures to progressively reduce the social, environmental, and economic impacts of flooding, supported by a clear implementation and funding framework.\n\nRecommend updates to Council policies and planning instruments to ensure that future development on flood-affected land is compatible with identified flood hazards and risks.\n\nReview and improve existing flood management practices, including the operation of key hydraulic controls and natural floodplain features, to enhance flood mitigation outcomes.\n\nEnsure alignment with local emergency management planning, supporting effective flood response and evacuation strategies.\n\nSecure community support and engagement, ensuring that the FRMP reflects local values, experiences, and priorities in flood risk management.",

    "description": "The Stocky Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara Raadik 2014) is a newly described species with few museum specimens. The name ‘tantangara’ is taken from the small alpine stream from which the first specimens were collected, a tributary of the upper Murrumbidgee River draining from Mount Tantangara. The species is only known from one locality, the headwaters of Tantangara Creek, upstream of the Tantangara Reservoir, NSW. It is restricted to a small creek above a waterfall, approximately 4 km from the source. \nThe Stocky Galaxias is a small fish named after its distinctly stocky body. It is recorded to grow to 103mm long and 13g in weight, but is more commonly 75-85 mm long. The body is predominantly dark olivebrown on the back and upper sides above the lateral line, becoming lighter to cream ventrally. Individuals possess many dark brown to almost black spots and flecks that may vary in size, found along the body, head and snout. The fins are translucent dusky grey and the gill covers are translucent. It has a long anal fin, short nostrils and an upper jaw that is slightly longer than the lower jaw. \nThey are a critically endangered species -\nhttps://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/species-protection/whatcurrent/critically/stocky-galaxias.\nAs this species only occurs in one locality, the 2018 NSW Hydroline was used for its indicative distribution.",

    "description": "Conservation of riverine and wetland vegetation diversity is a key objective of the Basin Plan, and was a core element investigated at the Basin-scale in the LTIM Project. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project examined the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and assisted the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nVegetation diversity data was collected and used over the duration of the LTIM Project from 2014-15 to 2018-19 from four wetland Selected Areas (Gwydir, Lachlan, Murrumbidgee and junction of Warrego-Darling river systems) and two riverine Selected Areas (Edward/Kolety-Wakool and Goulburn river systems), considering plant species diversity and vegetation community diversity. \r\n\r\nData collected* includes the percent cover of plant species present within three vegetation strata (groundlayer, understorey and overstorey) and a range of environmental variables (e.g. soil moisture) at time of sampling. \r\n\r\n*Data collected from the Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system is limited to Category 3 and does not have the same taxonomic resolution or range of observations as that from other Selected Areas. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Vegetation Diversity Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin.

In collaboration with NPRSR rangers, and where possible with local NGOs and Indigenous Rangers, we propose to establish vegetation and faunal monitoring sites across the rainforest/woodland boundaries and associated vegetation types in key areas of the Mission Beach, Tully lowlands and Hinchinbrook Channel areas to assess faunal and floral status and trends. This project will produce maps and assess the impact of fire in of areas of greatest concern, including littoral rainforest and coastal vine thickets and riparian forest. We will assess the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Yasi on mahogany glider habitat, levels of rainforest invasion, and impacts of fire on new vegetation.",

    "description": "The association of FRB 200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 confirms that magnetars can power fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, FRB 200428 is 4 to 8 orders of magnitude less energetic than the typical population of cosmological FRBs. This discrepancy is likely due to the moderate magnetic field strength and evolved age of SGR 1935+2154. In contrast, newborn extragalactic magnetars, such as those formed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines, are expected to have much stronger magnetic fields, more rapid spin-down, and highly dynamic magnetospheres, all of which favor the production of brighter and more frequent FRBs.\n\nWe propose a targeted search for FRBs from the recently localized GRB 230307A, a long-duration GRB with evidence suggesting the formation of a young magnetar. Given the source's relatively close distance (291 Mpc) and possible youth (less than 3 years), it offers a compelling opportunity to test FRB generation mechanisms during the early evolution of a magnetar.\n\nWe request 30 hours of observing time with the Parkes 64-m Murriyang telescope using the ultra-wideband low-frequency (UWL) receiver. Our plan includes one 10-hour long-duration session to detect rare or clustered bursts, and ten 2-hour sessions spread over 2-3 months to sample temporal variability. Data will be processed with state-of-the-art pipelines for single-pulse searches and coherent dedispersion.\n\nA detection would strongly support magnetar-origin FRB models and provide key constraints on the early-time activity of GRB-formed neutron stars.",

    "description": "This dataset is an output of the  Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP). Environmental Pessures Theme - Project Habitats and Biodiversity Characterisation and Mapping.  The benthic invertebrate, plant and fish biodiversity of the west Pilbara region was sampled between 10 and 27 June 2013 during voyages on the CSIRO vessel RV Linnaeus and WA Fisheries vessel RV Naturaliste. The equipment used was:\n0.75m epibenthic sled at 13 sites for a distance of ~300m or a\n1.5m epibenthic sled at 98 sites for a distance of ~150m per tow; \na Pipe dredge attached to each sled;\nan 8 Fathom Florida Flyer Trawl at 43 sites for a distance of ~1km per tow;\nand a Drop-Camera video system towed for a 500 m transect at 123 sites to observe and record video of the seabed habitat. Continuous underway coding during Drop-camera transects recorded cover of 9 substratum types, 25 biohabitat types, and occurrence of 14 faunal classes.\n\nThe results for the Sled and Trawl are presented as biomass per area swept by the gear (kg per ha).  \n\nDuring the Voyage Biota collected using the Sled and Trawl were sorted into 26 broad taxonomic categories from each tow (samples). These  were photographed, weighed, preserved and retained for identification.\nLarge biota such as turtles and seasnakes were measured, counted, weighed (or weight estimated), photographed and returned to the ocean alive.\nNon-living rocks/shells were photographed and weighed as a category called trash and returned to the ocean.\n\nThe following groups were retained and identified by taxonomists and voucher specimens curated at WA Museum:\nMarine Plants;\nSponges;\nCorals;\nCrustaceans;\nEchinoderms;\nMolluscs;\nand Fishes\n - many sponges were collected and require microscopic examination for identification - processing is expected to be complete mid 2016.\n\nThe following groups were retained with no facility for further identification as part of this project, and are currently at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere WA:\nAscidians - samples separated into colonial and solitary preserved in formalin;\nBrachiopoda - Frozen;\nBryozoa - Frozen;\nHydroids - Frozen;\nMiscellaneous - Frozen;\nWorms - Formalin.\n\nA pipe-dredge was attached to the sled to collect sediment samples: a 500 ml subsample was retained.\n\nThe Pilbara Marine Conservation Partnership (PMCP) was an initiative designed to enhance the net conservation benefits of the globally-significant coral reef ecosystems of the Pilbara (Western Australia) by providing an assessment of the condition and trajectory of key ecological values. These assessments were designed to inform and complement existing governance and management arrangements and the PMCP is intended to provide ongoing advice and assessment for conservation efforts in the region, providing lasting benefits.\nThe PMCP concept is based on three core ecological components, namely: \nCoral Reef Health - concentrating mainly on habitat forming primary producers.\nFish and Sharks - their community structure, interactions and impacts on lower trophic levels.\nEnvironmental Pressures - physical and anthropogenic factors that influence the condition of reefs",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2002 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to the leading causes of death by sex. The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes:\n    Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries\nas well as on a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web page to access these reports and for further information: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the forestry node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment; the only commodity in this node is Radiata pine. Maps are provided for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination contained in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations.",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "Howards Springs are situated about 3.5 miles north-east of a point on the Stuart highway about 16 miles south of Darwin. They are seepage springs on a branch of the Howard River. Radioactive material was found in the area by Mr. L. Good, Box 273, Darwin, during October, and samples were sent to Rum Jungle for testing. A brief inspection of the area was made by the writer and Dr. N.H. Fisher on 7th November, 1952. It seems likely that the mineral causing radioactivity has been precipitated, probably by organic matter, from the spring water in the black clay layer, but the original source of the material is not at present clear.",

    "description": "The 2015-16 Budget is officially available at [budget.gov.au](http://www.data.gov.au) as the authoritative source of Budget Papers and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2015-16 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* The Portfolio Budget Statement Excel spreadsheets – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n* A Machine Readable CSV of all PBS Excel Spreadsheet Line Items – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate and translated (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nData from the 2015-16 Budget are provided to assist those who wish to analyse, visualise and programmatically access the 2015-16 Budget. \r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n##Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV##\r\n\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes. Only the line item data (table 2.2) is available in CSV at this stage. Much of the other data is also available in the Budget Papers 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2015-16 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.2: Programme Expenses and Programme Components.\r\n* Table 3.1.1: Movement of Administered Funds Between Years;\r\n* Table 3.1.2: Estimates of Special Account Flows and Balances;\r\n* Table 3.1.3: Australian Government Indigenous Expenditure (AGIE);\r\n* Tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.2.7 to 3.2.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2015-16 PBS line items dataset’ was prepared from individual entity programme expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (*Statement 6, Budget Paper 1*). \r\n\r\nDifferences relate to:\r\n\r\n1. Intra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2. Entity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3. Additional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that are directly government funded are required to prepare a PBS.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required. \r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entities PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is;\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2014-15\r\n* 2015-16\r\n* 2016-17\r\n* 2017-18\r\n* 2018-19\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe data transformation is expected to be complete by midday 13 May.  We may put up an incomplete CSV which will continue to be updated as additional PBSs are transformed into data form.\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV: \r\n\r\n* Agriculture\r\n* Attorney General's\r\n* Communications\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education and Training \r\n* Employment\r\n* Environment\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health\r\n* Human Services\r\n* Immigration and Border Protection\r\n* Industry and Science\r\n* Infrastructure and Regional Development\r\n* Parliamentary Departments\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs\r\n\r\n##Budget Paper Tables##\r\n\r\nWe have made a number of data tables from the Budget Papers available in Excel and CSV formats.\r\n\r\nBelow is the list of the tables published and whether we’ve translated them into CSV form this year:\r\n\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Appendix A1 - Estimates of expenses by function and sub‑function\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix C Major Intiatives\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Overview - Appendix D Major Savings\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 3 - Table 7: Reconciliation of underlying cash balance estimates\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 1: Australian Government general government receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 7: Australian Government general government (cash) receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Table 10: Reconciliation of 2015‑16 general government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 4 - Supplementary table 3: Australian Government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 1: Australian Government general government sector receipts, payments, net Future Fund earnings and underlying cash balance\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 4: Australian Government general government sector taxation receipts, non‑taxation receipts and total receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1: Statement 10 - Table 5: Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.1 – Agency Resourcing\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.2 – Special Appropriations\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.3 – Special Accounts\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 2.2 – Staffing Tables\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.1 – Departmental Expenses\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.2 – Net Capital Investment\r\n\r\n###Change Log###\r\n1. *22:30PM 12/05/2015* dataset first published\r\n2. *09:00 13/05/2015* machine readable csv updated to include data from National Museum of Australia, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency & Australian Institute of Family Studies.\r\n3. *15:30 13/05/2015* machine readable csv updated to include a column linking to resource file and fixed a few minor errors.\r\n4. *16:00 14/05/2015* have added several selected transformed tables from Budget Paper 4.\r\n5. *12:30 18/05/2015* several minor updates to CSV.\r\n6. *16:00 03/06/2015* added several machine readable Budget Paper 1 tables prepared by Department of the Treasury.",
