    "description": "The Hobart Stormwater Drainage Network Data set is a representation of the pipe work and nodes that discharges stormwater to the River Derwent, or other natural creeks or rivulets. The purpose of the dataset is to meet Council's statutory obligations, and to maintain an accurate record of the location of the drainage network infrastructure for operational purposes. This dataset consists of 2 primary feature classes: Drainage_Nodes and Drainage_Pipes. The Drainage node types within the dataset are: Standard manhole, Pollution control unit, Inspection opening, Maintenance shaft, Junction points, End of lines - Intake points (Including headwalls) - Outlet Points (Including headwalls), Gully pits: Single, Double, Deflector and Side entry pit. The attributes associated with the nodes are: OBJECTID, Asset_ID, Asset_Description, Asset_BusinessID, DRAINAGE_Nodes_Type_Description, CLAHD (Cover Level Australian Height Datum) and ILAHD (Invert Level Australian Height Datum). The attributes associated with the pipes are: OBJECTID, DRAINAGE_Pipes_DRAINAGE_Pipes_D (Drainage Pipes Diameter), DRAINAGE_Pipes_DRAINAGE_Pipes_M (Drainage Pipes Material), USILAHD (Upstream Invert Level Australian Height Datum), DSILAHD (Downstream Invert Level Australian Height Datum), Asset_ID. Business_ID, Asset_Description, Year_Created, Type_Description, Shape__Length. The stormwater drainage network dataset is available in a stand alone format, also each component can be used or accessed individually. The drainage network dataset is used in various forms in conjunction with other datasets. the first instances of the drainage network appearing on any Council record is on the original 1:528 Detail Plans of the early 1900's. However there was no statutory requirement, or effort into collection or maintaining the drainage network information prior to the Local Government Act of 1966. Since that time all newly created drains have been recorded and maintain on the 1:528 Detail Plan series. Any drains identified as the responsibility of the Council constructed before this time were added to the Detail Plans. Hence whilst every effort has been made to record all \"known\" pipes and nodes that make up the drainage network there is no guarantee that the Council's records are complete.",

    "description": "A combination of surveys and experiments were used to determine the size distribution, recruitment, mortality and growth rates of Siphonaria diemenensis in 2 zones on the rocky shore at Griffith Point, San Remo, Victoria. One zone was in the high intertidal (Zone 2) and one was in the low intertidal area on the shore. There were 3 sites in Zone 1 and 2 sites in Zone 2 (see parent record for more details). \n\nA size frequency distribution was constructed for each site from surveys that recorded the size of all individuals every 2 months from October 1979 to December 1981. In addition to the sites in Zone 1 there were 12 permanent quadrats (50 x 50cm) which were surveyed in the same manner from December 1980 to December 1981. The sizes of recruits were similar in both Zones but the sizes of adults were significantly greater in Zone 2. In both years, the maximum density of recruits in Zone 1 was greater than in Zone 2. The mortality rate of adult limpets in Zone 2 was lower compared to limpets in Zone 1.\n\nThe growth rates (mm per month) of marked individuals were calculated for 3 time intervals; January-March, March-May and May-late July (Zone 2) and Mary-early August (Zone 1) in 1981. Limpets in Zone 2 grew faster (average 0.63 mm per month) than the limpets in Zone 1 (average 0.11mm per month). \n\nIn addition, an experiment was conducted in Zone 1 from May to July in 1981 to determine the effects of adult density and macroalgal cover on limpet recruitment. It was found that there was no effect of adult density but a significant interactive effect of algal cover and sampling date on the number of limpet recruits.",

This region includes the Port Phillip Bay and Western\nPort coastlines. Points are captured to show the indicative location of the\nendpoint for a waterway or channel as geographic coordinates.\nThe data table includes minimal attributes to assist in\nidentifying the feature.\nData was created using the waterway (Reach) layer from original FIS\n1:50K (Vicmap Hydro) streams data set, which included only those waterways\nwithin catchments of greater than 60ha. Waterways (Reach) Rectification project\nundertaken 2001 to 2003 to review and correct the extent of the waterways reach\nnetwork to ensure a complete data set exists (using the Drainage Metropolis\nBoundary, 50K data, 1:2500 Drainage Record Plans, Drainage Limits data,\northophotos, as constructed and/or design drawings, contour data and Melway\nStreet Directory). Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in\nGIS and AMIS for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for\nstart / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length\nthat are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated\nin 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10\nusing Lidar survey data (contours). Data is maintained using Lidar survey data\n(contours) and 60 ha limits.

    "description": "<b>Oct 2024 Minor Amendment No.3</b>\n(Zone Map Dataset 2 of 5, needs to be used in conjunction with Zones, Local plan boundary, Local plan precincts and North Lakes Locality datasets).\nThe Zoning Map is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of distinct clients to alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) by treatment type. The AODTS data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the client was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment type refers to the type of activity used to treat the client's alcohol or other drug problem. Main treatment type is the principal activity that is determined at assessment by the treatment provider to be necessary for the completion of the treatment plan for the client's alcohol or other drug problem for their principal drug of concern. One main treatment type is reported for each treatment episode.\n\n\nAssessment only, support and case management only, and information and education only can only be reported as main treatment types. The AODTS NMDS also collects data on a client's other treatment types; however this variable is not included the data.\n\n\nDue to the nuances of data collection systems in Western Australia and Victoria, caution should be used when comparing the reported number of episodes by main treatment type in these states' PHNs to others. Western Australia's and Victoria's data collection systems do not collect an additional treatment type. Instead, a new treatment episode is opened for any additional treatment a client receives, and the additional treatment is recorded as the main treatment. This may inflate the reported number of episodes provides in the collection year.\n\n",

    "description": "This is Version 2 of the Australian Soil Clay Content product of the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia.\n\nIt supersedes the Release 1 product that can be found at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4225/08/546EEE35164BF\">https://doi.org/10.4225/08/546EEE35164BF</a>.\n\nThe map gives a modelled estimate of the spatial distribution of clay in soils across Australia.\n\nThe Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia has produced a range of digital soil attribute products. Each product contains six digital soil attribute maps, and their upper and lower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths: 0-5&nbsp;cm, 5-15&nbsp;cm, 15-30&nbsp;cm, 30-60&nbsp;cm, 60-100&nbsp;cm and 100-200&nbsp;cm. These depths are consistent with the specifications of the GlobalSoilMap.net project - <a href=\"https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/Resources/GlobalSoilMap_specifications_december_2015_2.pdf\">GlobalSoilMaps</a>. \nThe digital soil attribute maps are in raster format at a resolution of 3 arc sec (~90 x 90&nbsp;m pixels).\n\nDetailed information about the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia can be found at - <a href=\"https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/index.html\">SLGA</a>\n\n<ul><li>Attribute Definition: 2&nbsp;μm mass fraction of the less than 2&nbsp;mm soil material determined using the pipette method;</li>\n<li>Units: %;</li>\n<li>Period (temporal coverage; approximately): 1950-2021;</li>\n<li>Spatial resolution: 3 arc seconds (approx 90&nbsp;m);</li>\n<li>Total number of gridded maps for this attribute: 18;</li>\n<li>Number of pixels with coverage per layer: 2007M (49200 * 40800);</li>\n<li>Data license : Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY);</li>\n<li>Target data standard: GlobalSoilMap specifications;</li>\n<li>Format: Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF.</li></ul>",

We aim to explore the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through the application of the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained across a wide bandwidth spanning 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. Emission heights will be measured using both the delay-radius and geometrical\n  methods to examine their frequency dependence and test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of different profile components will be conducted to constrain pulsar emission properties, while pulse intensity modulations will be analyzed to identify potential phase-lock phenomena. Our study will provide more information on the understanding of the properties of pulsars with IP emissions.",

    "description": "This study used observations of Lepsiella vinosa and surveys of prey species to describe the diet of L.vinosa on rocky shore at West Head, Victoria. The numbers of individual L.vionsa observed feeding were recorded during the surveys of Site 1 and Site 2 from 1975 to 1978 (see ?The population dynamics of the gastropod Lepsiella vinosa on the West Head rocky shore in Victoria? file identifier: 05f4f7f0-f49f-11dc-9f74-00188b4c0af8). In addition, six quadrats (25 x 25 cm) were randomly placed at the 2 sites every 2 months from March 1976 to January 1977. The number and size (measured to the nearest 0.01 cm) of prey species was recorded in each quadrat.\n\nThe number of L.vinosa recorded feeding varied seasonally and strongly correlated with the changes in density of prey species. In Area 1, L.vinosa was feeding on Littorina unifasciata for 66% of the observations and Littorina praetermissa, Bembicium nanum, Kellia australis, Nerita atramentosa, Chthamalus atennatus and Zenostrobus pulex for the remaining proportion of observations (n=895). In Area 2, there were fewer observations of feeding L.vinosa (n=53) with the same species recorded as prey items but the majority 34% of L.vinosa was feeding on Nerita atramentosa. Analyses of the data from the quadrats indicated that, in late summer and autumn, L.vinosa reduced its selectivity for prey species, compared to early winter and spring, when they targeted Littorina spp.",

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA94Spatial ExtentFull StateContent LineageFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityFor additional information, please contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "NSW Tenancy laws say how residential tenancy agreements can be ended. Tenancies are usually terminated by the tenant, landlord, the landlord's agent, or by a Tribunal order. Fair Trading conducts an end-of tenancy survey to collect data about how and why tenancies end. This survey was designed to help Fair Trading to better understand the renting experience to help inform future tenancy reforms. The current survey commenced on 2 August 2021.\nThe survey process\nEvery principal tenant and landlord or nominated agent is asked to complete a survey when a bond claim is finalised through an online bonds system. Survey invitations are sent by email and participation is voluntary. Individual responses are kept anonymous.\nFair Trading initially conducted a pilot survey in 2019/2020. Results from that survey informed the current ongoing end of tenancy survey. \nThe end of tenancy survey \nThe survey data is collected quarterly, and is available to download for use by the community, research, business and industry.\nTo mitigate re-identification risks, postcode information has been removed and response dates grouped into months.\nIt should be noted that the representativeness of the survey data is limited, including because:\n*  participation is voluntary\n*  the survey only includes respondents who used Rental Bonds Online to lodge and claim their rental bond, so the sample does not extend to all terminated tenancies\n*  no demographic information is collected\n*  some tenancies had duplicate responses\n*  domestic violence victims may also self-select out of completing such a survey, given their vulnerability and the difficult circumstances they may experience after ending a tenancy.\n*  The survey commenced in August 2021",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2011.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the measurement of Secchi Depth and Total suspended solids (inorganic and organic components) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network -National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling.\n\nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW).\n\nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\n\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) off small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\n\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\n\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

The term 'patched' means that if on any day a station does not have an observation then the gap in the record is 'patched' (ie. filled) with an estimate obtained by spatial interpolation of the daily data from surrounding stations. Consequently the Patched Point Data for a given location always contain a complete data record, or in other words, there are no missing data.",

    "description": "This proposal aims to constrain burst rates and spin down properties of a sample of new Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) discovered with the ASKAP CRAFT Coherent upgrade (CRACO) system. Over the past 12-months of commissioning, CRACO discovered and precisely localised 15 new RRATs, characterised by their sporadic pulses with dispersion measures (DM) consistent with Galactic sources. We request 22.5h of Parkes time split into three 30min observations spanning 6-months for each target. This can help constrain periods and potentially phase-coherent timing solutions given that we already have arcsec-precision interferometric localisations. Our main science goals are: 1) to measure their burst rates, periods, and spin-down properties; 2) to assess their nulling fraction and intermittency; 3) to measure their polarimetric properties and constrain their emission mechanism; 4) to determine if the CRACO RRATs are fundamentally different from the known RRAT population. Some of these goals can be answered even with the detection of a limited number of pulses.",

See more information here.\n\nEach row contains information about the restrictions that apply to one parking bay. Each restriction consists of a set of columns:\n\nHow the data joins:\nThere are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions. \nThe way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don’t currently join.\n\nField information:\n- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)\n- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive. (1-5=Monday to Friday)\n- StartTime: The time each day when the restriction applies.\n- EndTime: The time each day when the restriction ends.\n- TypeDesc: The type of restriction. Eg: \"2P Meter\" (two hour parking, paid for using a meter), \"Disabled Only\" (only vehicles with disabiled permits can park).\n- Description: A compact, human-readable description of the overall restrictions. TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces\n- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).\n- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\n\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times. Each restriction is a set of columns with a number: FromDay1, ToDay1, StartTime1, EndTime1, etc.\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhile all due care has been taken to ensure the data of this website is accurate, current and available please note: \n·         there may be errors or omission in it\n·         there may be occasions where the data is not available and/or the website will be unavailable. \n\nThe City of Melbourne and its employees accept no responsibility for any loss, damage, claim, expense, cost or liability whatsoever (including in contract, tort including negligence, pursuant to statue and otherwise) arising in respect of or in connection with accessing, using or reliance upon the data in this website, or the unavailability of the data or the website.",

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

    "description": "This dataset contains information about children that are vulnerable on one or more domains of the Australian Early Development Censuses (AEDC) from 2009 - 2018. The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the Rental Affordability Index (RAI) for 3 bedroom dwellings. The data uses different income values for each region within the Greater Capital Cities, and spans the quarters Q1 2011 to Q2 2021. The RAI covers all states with available data, the Northern Territory and Western Australia does not form part of this dataset.\nNational Shelter, Bendigo Bank, The Brotherhood of St Laurence, and SGS Economics and Planning have released the RentalAffordability Index (RAI) on a biannual basis since 2015. Since 2019, the RAI has been released annually.\nIt is generally accepted that if housing costs exceed 30% of a low-income household's gross income, the household is experiencing housing stress (30/40 rule). That is, housing is unaffordable and housing costs consume a disproportionately high amount of household income. The RAI uses the 30 per cent of income rule. Rental affordability is calculated using the following equation, where 'qualifying income' refers to the household income required to pay rent where rent is equal to 30% of income: \nRAI = (Median income ∕ Qualifying Income) x 100\nIn the RAI, households who are paying 30% of income on rent have a score of 100, indicating that these households are at the critical threshold for housing stress. A score of 100 or less indicates that households would pay more than 30% of income to access a rental dwelling, meaning they are at risk of experiencing housing stress.\nFor more information on the Rental Affordability Index please refer to SGS Economics and Planning.\nThe RAI is a price index for housing rental markets. It is a clear and concise indicator of rental affordability relative to household incomes, applied to geographic areas across Australia. \nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using geometries provided by SGS Economics and Planning. Values of 'NA' in the original data have been set to NULL.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

The data covers migrating settlers with a Date of Settlement between 01/07/2020 and 30/06/2021. The location data is aggregated based on the Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries of the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data in this dataset are sourced from the Settlement Database (SDB). Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit Data.gov.au.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data with the 2011 LGA boundaries of the ABS Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC). Where the recorded number of settlers is less than 5 (\"&lt;5\" in the original table), it has been set to 4 for confidentiality.",

This data is designed for use by planners to assess whether development applications for specific sites require additional conditions on the basis of whether normal land development activities carry a risk of disturbing PASS materials. Disturbance risk is rated on the basis of the likelihood of PASS materials being encountered within 3m of the ground surface should this depth of soil be disturbed in any way. The depth of 3m is considered since this was regarded as the depth that most soil disturbance activities would extend during in most land development processes. Disturbance activities in this context include drainage, excavations and dewatering. For further information phone the Contaminated Sites hotline 1300 762 982.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Acid Sulfate Soil Risk Map, Geraldton (DER-009).\nThis dataset is no longer actively maintained by DWER.",

The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~80cm depth corresponding to heavier 18-O values and other measured parameters.",

Georeferenced TIF image of the magentics of the Beetaloo Sub-basin and adjacent area.  Total magnetic intensity (TMI) data measures variations in the intensity of the Earth magnetic field caused by the contrasting content of rock-forming minerals in the Earths crust. Magnetic anomalies can be either positive (field stronger than normal) or negative (field weaker) depending on the susceptibility of the rock. The 2015 Total magnetic Intensity (TMI) grid of Australia has a grid cell size of ~3 seconds of arc (approximately 80 m). This grid only includes airborne-derived TMI data for onshore and near offshore continental areas.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessments\n\n\n## **History** \nThis dataset is a clip of the Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) Grid of Australia 2015 (sixth edition) for the area immediately surrounding the Beetaloo GBA region.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of Affected Family Members (AFMs) of Family Violence Intervention Order (FVIO) applications heard in the Victorian Children's Court, retrieved from Courtlink. The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of AFMs per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of AFMs on original applications in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: AFM Rate = (Number of AFMs/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nTo avoid double counting individuals, demographic information of applicants/AFMs and respondents are of those on original applications.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nDue to improvements made in data processing since the database release ending 30 June 2017, slight movement has occurred in numbers of AFMs and the number of applications outcomes.\n\n\nData was extracted from Courtlink on 30 August 2018.\n\n",

    "description": "Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2002-2022. It shows floor space (in square meters) per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC1) and small area allocation. \n\nThe City of Melbourne creates unique codes to account for floor space allocated to residential space, vacant space, open space and common area. These unique codes are not included within ANZSIC 1 classification and therefore these floor areas are not included in this data set.\n\nThis data set has been confidentialised to protect the commercially sensitive information of individual businesses. Data in cells which pertain to two or fewer businesses have been suppressed and are shown as a blank cell. The row and column totals refer to the true total, including those suppressed cells.\n\nNon-confidentialised data may be made available subject to a data supply agreement.

    "description": "*Forests of Australia (2023)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report – 2023 update*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation\r\nand land cover data inputs, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as:\r\n\"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single\r\nstem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2021) (unpublished, also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2020), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map as forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2023)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "This dataset is part of the assessment and mapping of foreshore value, condition and pressure in the Southern Natural Resource Management (NRM) Region of Tasmania. The 17 line maps produced in this study are intended to be used as a tool to assist managers and stakeholders in the identification of management issues with regards to foreshore planning, development, and natural resources. Assessment of the foreshore is based on the division of the high water line into 100m segments. Using a decision matrix and rule set, each foreshore segment is assigned a score for three main components: fields, attributes and indices. Segments are colour coded based on their attribute or index score to reflect the differing levels of overall natural value, human use value, condition, pressure or components thereof. This digital line map is a representation of the European heritage value of foreshores in the southern NRM region and is an attribute layer supporting the overall Human Use Value Index. European heritage value is calculated based on listed sure of European heritage significance. An explanatory report is available from the data custodian which provides detailed methodology and further explanation of the dataset.",

    "title": "Urban Development Program - Major Residential Redevelopments Sites 2022",
    "description": "The Urban Development Program (UDP) monitors and reports on major residential redevelopment projects across metropolitan Melbourne. Major redevelopment projects are those comprising ten or more dwellings. Data is collected from administrative and commercial data sources and through analysis of aerial imagery.\nThese include projects which may have an existing planning permit, or are in the planning processes, those that are current under construction, as well as potential longer term projects on sites that local councils have identified for residential purposes.\nA timing classification is attributed to each project based on commercial data sources, consultation with local councils, and the stage the project has reached in the planning process. The Urban Development Program reports on major redevelopment projects using the following categories:\n\n<em>Completed - Projects completed from Jan 2021 to Jan 2022\n</em>Under Construction - Projects under construction at Jan 2022\n<em>Firm - Projects that have been approved and/or taking sales enquires and registrations. \n</em>Likely - Projects that are within the planning process, projects with recently lapsed planning permits, projects that have been sold with a recent planning permit\n*Possible - Early indicator of the location of future major redevelopment projects or projects that have been inactive for a number of years.\n\nWhile the UDP acknowledges a proportion of proposed projects may be abandoned or delayed, the classification process provides an indicator of available supply provided there is sufficient demand. In addition, it is acknowledged there are also sites within the established parts of Melbourne that may be suitable for residential development into the future but have not yet been identified. The UDP will continue to report on these sites as they are identified for redevelopment for residential purposes.\nIt should also be noted that the timings attached to these projects are indicative. Construction rates can be cyclical in nature, and highly dependent on underlying demand and pre-sales, economic cycles and industry capacity.

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "This dataset comprises the biomass sampling component of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80 deg C)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

The dataset was created from fieldwork, consultation with local experts, vector data sets, databases and 2009/2010 RapidEye imagery which required successive stages of data collection, interpretation, verification and validation for a quality assured final product. Minimal mappable areas varied from 10 ha for mapping at 1:50 000 from RapidEye imagery and less for other datasets used with larger scales.  Land use data is used to develop effective responses to national agricultural and natural resource management problems and regional assessments of agricultural productivity and opportunities.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with GP costs, and out-of-pocket cost per GP attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare-subsidised patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances exclude services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

A similar service with a ‘multiCRS’ suffix is available which can support GDA2020, GDA94 and WGS 84 ≈ GDA2020 environments.In due course, and allowing time for user feedback and testing, it is intended that the original service name will adopt the new multiCRS functionality.\nMetadata Portal Metadata InformationContent TitleNSW Features of Interest - State Electoral District_RetiredContent TypeHosted Feature LayerDescriptionStateElectoralDistrict2013_retired is a dataset within the NSW Administrative boundaries theme (FSDF). It represents a snapshot of NSW electoral boundaries which were formalised in the 2013 electoral redistribution and retired before the 2023 NSW state election.The retired Electoral District boundary aligned to the cadastral line data at time of capture. As this data is no longer maintained, this alignment may no longer exist.

Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m.

Examples of 30A\napprovals include emergency events (such as clean-up after a bushfire or\nflood), temporary events (like temporary relief of a public nuisance or\ncommunity hardship) and commissioning (bringing new equipment on or offline).  \nEPA decides when to issue a 30A approval on a case-by-case basis, but we must\nrespond to applications promptly. The approval must be consistent with the\npurpose, principles and other provision of the Act.  \nEPA takes a risk-based approach to the assessment of a 30A approval to ensure\nthat the proposed activities:\n are appropriate for the event\nwill not cause any long-term damage to the environment\nconsider the needs of the community and other stakeholders.  \n30A approvals can last for up to 120 days.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of female cancer mortality statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 11 top cancer groupings (breast, cervical, colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, ovary, pancreas, thyroid and uterus) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a GCCSA. The number of people who could not be assigned a GCCSA is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia carried out marine surveys in south-east Tasmania in 2008 and 2009 (GA0315) to map seabed bathymetry and characterise benthic environments through observation of habitats using underwater towed video. Data was acquired using the Tasmania Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute (TAFI) Research Vessel Challenger. Bathymetric mapping was undertaken in seven survey areas, including: Freycinet Pensinula (83 sq km, east coast and shelf); Tasman Peninsula (117 sq km, east coast and shelf); Port Arthur and adjacent open coast (17 sq km); The Friars (41 sq km, south of Bruny Island); lower Huon River estuary (39 sq km); D Entrecastreaux Channel (7 sq km, at Tinderbox north of Bruny Island), and; Maria Island (3 sq km, western side). Video characterisations of the seabed concentrated on areas of bedrock reef and adjacent seabed in all mapped areas, except for D Entrecastreaux Channel and Maria Island. Seabed sediment samples were collected by TAFI in August 2010 in a targeted area to the east of Tasman Peninsula. Samples were collected at 25 stations using a Van Veen grab, from which a 50 - 100 g sub-sample was taken and submitted to Geoscience Australia for analysis. This dataset is a contribution to the CERF Marine Biodiversity Hub.",

    "description": "The data set contains airborne pollen concentrations (grains per cubic meter) from samples taken at Rocklea, Queensland, Australia (-27.5351,152.9933) between October 2016 and June 2020. Each data row has two concentrations: one for grass (Poaceae) and one for all other pollens. For comparison with other data sets and between pollen seasons the data weeks start at July 1 each calendar year. Extra days at the end of the pollen year are included in week 52. Each data row has a collection period start date, the number of days within the collection period (7-9), and the number of days on which pollen was collected and summed (0-9). Concentrations represent only the number of days collected and not always the full collection period, as indicated. \nAirborne pollen samples were collected using a volumetric continuous flow impaction sampler (Burkard Manufacturing, UK), stained with fuchsin and counted by light microscopy according to best practice described in the Australian Airborne Pollen and Spore Monitoring Network Interim Standard and Protocols (Version 2, 14 September 2018).\nData may be used for modelling and forecasting airborne grass, other, total pollen levels. Other uses include analysis of the effect of pollen levels on asthma and allergy presentations, or in inference of grass and other vegetation growth patterns. Data may also be used for evaluation of medium or long-term trends over time or comparison withpollen exposure levels between spatial distant locations.\nMetadata about this and other AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network monitoring sites is provided on the National Environmental Monitoring Site Register. Information about other pollen and spores monitored can be found by the AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network Species Classification on the ARDC Research Vocabularies site.\nAURIN has added latitude, longitude and spatialised geometry columns for each row based on the coordinates of the pollen samples. Periods over which no data is available are marked as null.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has set suppressed values (\".\") as Null.",

Australia was the first nation to become a Contracting Party to the Convention.The Convention's broad aims are to halt the worldwide loss of wetlands and to conserve, through wise use and management, those that remain. This requires international cooperation, policy making, capacity building and technology transfer.There are 5 Ramsar sites within Queensland (Administrator is shown in brackets): Moreton Bay (Queensland), Bowling Green Bay (Queensland), Currawinya Lakes (Queensland), Shoalwater and Corio Bays (Queensland/ Commonwealth), Great Sandy (Queensland).",

    "description": "This data was collected in August/September 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V04.\n\nDeparted: \tFremantle, WA, Aug 25, 2011\nArrived:   \tGeraldton, WA, Sep 13, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",
