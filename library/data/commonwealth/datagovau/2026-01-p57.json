    "description": "This dataset was derived from the primary ‘SLATS Landsat woody change data (25m) for 1988 – 2010’ raster (grid) layers used to generate the annualised woody vegetation change rates for the 2010 NSW Annual Report of Native Vegetation. This data describes the areas and type of woody vegetation\nchange (loss) based on the analysis of multi-date Landsat imagery covering NSW.\nThis data is based on a biennial LANDSAT coverage between 1988-2006 and annual coverage 2006-2010. LANDSAT Imagery 1988-2008 was processed by Geoscience Australia at 25m resolution.\n2008 onwards is based on USGS processed LANDSAT at 30m resolution. Note, this vector data may generate slightly different aerial statistics to those generated from the source raster data. This is due to variation caused by the data transformation and vector cleaning processes applied in generating the vector data.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.18) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Cow Bay flux station was established in December 2008 and managed by James Cook University. The forest is classified as complex mesophyll vine forest, there are 94 species in the core 1&nbsp;Ha, and average tree height is 22&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is 90&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 3935&nbsp;mm. The Daintree Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse forests in Australia. The instruments are mounted on a walk-up tourist tower at 35&nbsp;m. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide are measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation.The early years 2009 - 12 had several data gaps. Shadowing of the radiometric equipment continues to cause artifacts on the radiometers - these can be seen as reduction in downwelling radiation with solar inclination. The site is part of the FNQ Rainforest SuperSite - associated with the Daintree node, which is part of the TERN, Australia. ",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "title": "Assessment of Swamp Sclerophyll Forest on Coastal Floodplains TEC on NSW Crown Forest Estate  (South Coast Region)",
    "description": "The operational map for Swamp Sclerophyll Forest (SSF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. The map was constructed in two parts, with State Forests to the north of Sydney being mapped in a separate process to those to the south of Sydney. We did this to minimise the risk that relationships between regional vegetation communities and the TEC would be confounded or masked by geographical variation or other major ecological gradients, which might otherwise be a significant risk if we had treated the full latitudinal range of the TEC as a single study area. In total, we assessed 1,218,000 hectares of State Forest across coastal NSW. This consisted of 868,000 hectares of State Forest on the north coast and more than 350,000 hectares of State Forest on the south coast.\nIn both study areas, the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for SSF and agreeing upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification.  The Panel found that SSF is primarily defined by floristic plot data and that it is mostly located on coastal floodplains and associated alluvial landforms.\nFollowing on from these conclusions, we started the mapping process by mapping the distribution of floodplains and alluvial soils and thus identifying possible areas of SSF. For both the north and the south coast we used an existing map of coastal landforms and geology in combination with several fine-scale models of alluvial landform features to determine the likely extent of floodplains and alluvial soils within our study areas. \nWe used aerial photograph interpretation (API) to assess the floristic and structural attributes of the vegetation cover on our modelled alluvial environments, and thus delineated polygons likely to contain SSF. We also used API to modify the boundaries of the modelled alluvial areas using a prescribed list of eucalypt, casuarina and melaleuca species in combination with the interpretation of landform elements relevant to alluvial and floodplain environments.\nWe then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our modelled alluvial landforms and API polygons. For both the north and the south coast the floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of SSF. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the SSF determination.\nFollowing this, we developed a predictive statistical model of the probability of occurrence of SSF using plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables. For the north coast, we used a Random Forest model, while for the south coast we used a Boosted Regression Tree model.\nTo create the operational map, we assigned every mapped API polygon to SSF if appropriate based on the plot data, over-storey and understorey attributes, landform features and modelled probabilities underlying each API polygon. In total, we mapped approximately 1131 hectares of SSF across out study area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "Since the 1980s the managers of alpine resorts have collected information on visitation numbers.  Information on the number of visitors and the number of visitor days (visitors X length of stay) is collected on a weekly basis, based on entry pass sales information.  Visitation by visitors entering on single or multiple day passes is readily determined from actual pass sales, whilst visitation by the holders of season entry passes is based on estimates.\nCommencing in 2006, the Alpine Resorts Co-ordinating Council and the Alpine Resort Management Boards have conducted a consistent survey of visitation by season entry pass holders at all resorts, to better estimate visitation.  Each season entry pass holder is sent a survey card and asked to fill in details of their visits (including length of stay and passenger numbers) and return their survey cards to the Council.\nAt the end of the winter season, following analysis of the survey returns, Council adjusts the figures from the final week of the winter season to produce the annually-published ‘End-of-Season’ results.",

    "description": "The Tasmanian Quaternary Coastal Sediments polygon map is a digital map encoding a range of geomorphic and related attributes describing the soft Quaternary-age coastal sediment and landform types on the coastal areas of Tasmania and its major islands including the Bass Strait islands, but not Macquarie Island.  The original version of the map was compiled between during 2004 by Chris Sharples, by combining earlier map coverage's compiled in 1998 for the Tasmanian WNW coasts, and in 2001 for the SE Tasmania coast.  Subsequent field mapping by Frances Mowling and Chris Sharples during 2005 ' 2006 (funded by Natural Resource Management (NRM) projects), and  information extracted from published geological mapping, has been added to the map for eastern Tasmania and Flinders Island, and it is now (2006) in its 4th version.  A data dictionary accompanying the data set and available from the custodian gives a detailed explanation of attributes and other information about the map.\nThe map comprises polygons mapped at a variety of scales in different parts of the state (1:25,000 to 1:250,000 scale) and geo-referenced to the GDA94 datum.  Each polygon is tagged with a range of attribute codes describing sediment types, landforms and (where relevant) dune mobility.  The geomorphic data is presented in a simple descriptive format which is applicable to a wide range of coastal management and research purposes.\nThe map provides more complete mapping of coastal Quaternary sediments than do Tasmanian Geological Survey maps (which compromise Quaternary mapping cover by depicting both Quaternary sediments and bedrock in a single layer), however the Tasmanian Quaternary Coastal Sediments polygon map has not yet been compiled for the southern and south-western coastal areas of the Tasmanian mainland, and is complete but at widely varying scales in other parts of the State.",

There are four main types of SQID: Filter, Gross Pollution Trap (GPT), Trash Rack and Wetland. A filter is used to block finer particles and sediments. A GPT is used to block debris typically larger than 3mm. A Trash Rack is a series of metal vertical and/or horizontal metal bars positioned across a drainage channel and designed to intercept litter and debris. A wetland is a naturally occurring area inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater and capable of sustaining vegetation typically adapted for life in such conditions.",

    "description": "The Rental Report time series dataset provides detailed time-series statistics for some key Rental Report data from the June quarter of 1999 to the December quarter of 2017. This specific dataset presents the median rental costs of 1 bedroom flats by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nThe rent figures included in the Rental Report are weekly median rents. Median rents represent the midpoint in the distribution of all rents. Fifty per cent of rents are higher than the median and fifty per cent are below the median.\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in November 2008, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton (not bacteria and viruses this cruise).\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

A planting schedule for streets in each precinct has been developed in consultation with the community and is based on:\n\n-  Community priorities\n\n-  Location and density of vulnerable residents\n\n-  Opportunities for new planting\n\n-  Hot and very hot streets, as shown in thermal imaging \n\n-  Useful Life Expectancy of existing trees\n\n-  Existing canopy cover\n\n\n\nThis dataset shows the anticipated timeframe for tree planting in each street across the City of Melbourne. This timing is provisional and subject to change. The schedule for some streets may be moved forward or delayed by capital works, developments or renewal projects that impact on tree planting or survival. \n\n\n\nTo learn more about the Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans, visit http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sustainability/urbanforest/pages/urbanforest.aspx",

    "description": "The Victorian Training Market Reports are an on-going series of reports\nproduced by DEECD, with the aim of providing summaries of Victorian Vocational\nEducation and Training (VET) market performance and responsiveness to industry\nneeds. All VET providers who receive funding from the Victorian Government\nreport monthly to the Skills Victoria Training System (SVTS), which accepts\nand validates the providers' training activity data for payment, monitoring,\nreporting and related purposes.  DEECD analyses the providers' reported data\nin its production of the Victorian Training Market Reports.\nThe Reports summarise emerging trends in the Victorian training market and\nprovide a comparative overview of annual market changes.\nKey metrics in the Reports include training delivery by funding source,\nqualification level, training completions, employment status, higher needs\nlearners and region.  The Reports also analyse the responsiveness of training\ndelivery to specific occupational needs, industry and regional profiles.\nAll figures published in the Reports are generally rounded to the nearest 100.\nNB: The Victorian Training Market Reports are published quarterly. The data in\nthe first, second and third quarterly reports is considered preliminary and\nshould be treated as being indicative only.\nAll data supplied to Data VIC refers to activity reported and accepted by the\nSVTS system (data upload) for the Fourth Quarterly Report 2012.

    "description": "This thesis addresses questions of identity and ontological legitimacy within the commercial shark fishing community of Bass Strait, Australia. The implications of competing discourses for the integrity of fisher identity, environmental conservation and public narratives on environmental 'crises' are considered. Ethnographic material is drawn on and developed with commercial fishers and, to a lesser extent, fisheries 'experts', to explore ambiguities in understandings of individuality and perceptions of the marine environment. Informing this analysis are theories of practice, particularly notions of embodied relationships and knowledge, the role of 'luck' in enabling a particular expression of 'individuality', the 'skipper effect', a consideration of nation-state sanctioned and popular media representations of the environment, and the peculiarly Australian experience and representation of individuality, both as performance and as trope. These themes are considered against a backdrop of the physical and social activities involved in commercial fishing, and the 2001 nation-state-initiated introduction of an Individual Transferable Quota management system.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2009.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "The transitional NVR - category 2-vulnerable regulated land layer is a component of the transitional NVR map. The transitional NVR Map was prepared by Department of Planning and Environment (DPE) under Part 5A of the Local Land Services Act 2013 (LLS Act) and supporting Local Land Services Regulation 2014.  Category 2-vulnerable regulated land for this layer is taken to include land designated as steep or highly erodible land, protected riparian land or special category land.\n\nThe 2022 annual review of the transitional NVR map was published on 23 March 2022. Please read below for details about changes occurring as a result of the 2022 annual review. The latest version of the map can be viewed online using the transitional NVR Map viewer.\n\nhttps://www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/Maps/index.html?viewer=NVRMap\n\nThe category 2-vulnerable regulated land layer indicates where clearing of native vegetation may not be permitted under the Land Management (Native Vegetation) Code 2017, and a limited suite of allowable activities apply)\n\nCategory 2-vulnerable regulated land is comprised of three layers. These being:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/vulnerable-land-protected-riparian73a9e\">Vulnerable Riparian</a>. Generated from the NSW Hydroline and HydroArea dataset, natural named watercourses were used to capture streams with a buffer applied to both watercourses and water-bodies. \nThree datasets have been generated by creating buffers in the original dataset.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA 20-meter buffer was used for both sides of the bank to represent the no-clearing boundary within the banks of major streams, lakes and lagoons. The buffer polygon created includes the bed of the stream, lakes and lagoons. \n\nA 22.5-meter buffer was applied on either side streams mapped by hydroline. It was assumed that the average stream width for a stream represented by a stream centre line is 5m.\n\nFor minor streams mapped by hydroline, a 10m buffer was applied either side of the stream.\n\nVulnerable - Steep Land, generated from 5m elevation data (courtesy Dept. Customer Service). This product has currently been generated for all MGA Zones in NSW 54,55 and 56. \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/vulnerable-land-special-category414af\" title=\"Special category\">Special Category Land</a>. A selection of land susceptible to erosion or land that is otherwise environmentally sensitive, such as mass movement and salinity. </li>\n</ul>\n\nChanges to the mapping of category 2-vulnerable regulated land introduced in the publish of the revised transitional NVR Map on 23 March 2022 have resulted from the changes to the transitional NVR - land excluded from the LLS Act layer and also the refinement of the mapping of steep slopes land (&gt;18 degrees slope). Availability of more detailed elevation data (5m ELVIS DEM) for New South Wales has resulted in changes for steep land mapping in Eastern NSW (MGA Zone 56).\n\nThe data is provided as multi value raster that identifies the category 2-vulnerable regulated land, category 2-sensitive regulated land and where category 2-sensitive and category 2-vulnerable regulated land overlaps.\n\nPixel values:\n\n3 - category 2-vulnerable regulated land \n\n4 - category 2-sensitive regulated land \n\n6 - where category 2-sensitive and category 2-vulnerable regulated land overlap (display class)  \n\nSpatial datasets compiled in the category 2-vulnerable regulated land layer are sourced from Department Planning and Environment.\n\nData on the transitional NVR map viewer is updated on a monthly basis for minor data changes. https://www.lmbc.nsw.gov.au/Maps/index.html?viewer=NVRMap\n\nPlease contact Department of Planning and Environment data broker on data.broker@environment.nsw.gov.au for additional information.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the phytoplankton abundance and biovolume estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the Plankton National Reference Station within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly phytoplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the Australian National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is an integrated water sample collected with niskin bottles at 10m depth intervals and preserved in lugols solution. The depth of the sample varies at each station. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition / abundance (cells/l) 2. Biovolume (um3/L). Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

It comprises a digital map showing the locations of some abandoned penguin colonies (represented by points) and a linked digital database containing additional information. The importance of these sites derives from the fact that a chronology of penguin occupation can be established by radiocarbon dating and this in turn provides a minimum age for deglaciation of the Windmill Islands.\n\nThese data were compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes and from the records of other workers.

    "description": "This sub-project 'Transport Processes' - Project 3.3 aims to build on ‘conventional’ knowledge and formulations of sediment transport over open (bare) sandy beds, to develop new transport formulations applicable to a broad range of bottom types. \nThe objectives of sub-project 3.3 are therefore to; \n1) Develop new fundamental empirical relationships of sediment deposition and erosion rates applicable to a range of habitat types (e.g. coral reefs, seagrasses, etc.) as function of local hydrodynamics (waves and currents), physical properties of the sediment and bottom roughness/canopy characteristics.\n2) Provide direct field measures of sediment fluxes, settlement and resuspension rates (both natural and dredge-generated) under real hydrodynamic forcing.\n3) Incorporate new sediment transport routines applicable to a range of habitat types (developed in (1) and (2), within a community (open source) hydrodynamic and sediment transport model such as Delft3D or ROMS. In the future this new module could then easily be incorporated into any existing model.\nThis metadata focussed specifically on the field experiments which occurred at Thevenard Island, central Pilbara and Northern Ningaloo Reef",

    "description": "\n\n\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch engages the community in the environment through monitoring and caring for our catchments. We educate and raise awareness in schools and the community on issues concerning catchment health and we use data collected by volunteers to inform policy and on ground catchment management.\nUpper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers collect data on water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, and riparian vegetation condition at over 200 sites in the catchment. To use these data to assess the health of our waterways and the broader catchment, sites are grouped into reaches (segments of waterways and/or related waterbodies) and the data are summarised and presented by reach. To ensure that data collected from a small number of sites can be considered representative of a reach, reaches consist of similar sections of waterway as defined by criteria including the size (magnitude / stream order), surrounding land uses, and underlying geology of the included waterways and waterbodies.\nThis dataset contains annual scores of the water quality, waterbug diversity and abundance, riparian vegetation condition and overall health of individual reaches (stretches of waterway) in the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, 2015 - 2024. Scores are calculated from monthly water quality data collected by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch volunteers, and waterbug and riparian vegetation assessments conducted by Waterwatch staff. Detailed methods can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">Catchment Health Indicator Program (CHIP) reports </a>produced each year by Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch: <a href=\"https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au:443/data/chip-reports\">https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/data/chip-reports</a>\nThe data are best viewed using the <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/bf04e20bd88b4896854d86007d94eea3\">Waterwatch interactive map and data dashboard</a>.",

The data has been provided by The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).\nThe migration rate is the proportion of people in the area who were not born in Australia, that is, who have migrated to Australia in the past.\nAll indicators were extracted from the ABS Tablebuilder system using the usual residence profile. For usual residence data, the ABS moves people back to where they live, rather than using the location the data were collected (place of enumeration). Usual residence data is preferred for individual level data because it removes the effect of respondents travelling or holidaying.\nFor more information please view the NATSEM Technical Report.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data provided directly from NATSEM.\n\n\nWhere data values are NULL, the data is either unpublished or not applicable mathematically.\n\n\nIn the calculation, Inadequately Described, At sea, Not Stated and Overseas Visitor were excluded from both the numerator and denominator as there is no information on these respondents.\n\n\nMethodology between the 2016 NATSEM and 2011 OECD data release may have changed, please refer to the technical report for parity status and specific changes.\n\n",

They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. The most abundant species within core MD002361 is the subtropical species Gs. ruber. High abundances =30% are seen during the interglacial periods Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 11, 9, 7, 5 with peak abundance (37.7%) during the Holocene. Other tropical and subtropical species follow this pattern. The transitional, deep dwelling species Gr. inflata has the most distinct abundance change within core MD002361. This species is absent during the interglacial periods but achieves high relative abundances (~20-30%) during glacial periods.",

    "description": "<strong><em>This dataset is available on Brisbane City Council’s open data website – <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au\">data.brisbane.qld.gov.au</a>. The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from Brisbane River inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the overall Flood Awareness Mapping for Brisbane City Council.\n\nRiver flooding happens when widespread, prolonged rainfall occurs over the catchment of a river. As the river reaches capacity, excess water flows over its banks, causing flooding. River flooding can occur hours after the rain has finished, depending on the location within the catchment. The extent of river flooding depends on the severity of the weather and the capacity of the river among other things. The impact on a home depends on how close it is to the river and the proximity to low lying areas.\n\nThere are four different river flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe river flood High likelihood layer consists of the 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) flood extent. The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government.\n\nThe river flood Medium likelihood layer consists of the 1% AEP (100 year ARI) flood extent (outside high likelihood area). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government. \n\nThe river flood Low likelihood layer consists of the 0.2% AEP (500 year ARI) flood extent (outside high and medium likelihood areas). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government. \n\nThe river flood Very Low likelihood layer consists of the Extent of the 0.05% AEP (2000 year ARI) flood extent (outside high, medium and low likelihood areas). The extent was sourced from Brisbane River Catchment Flood Study (BMT, 2017) which was commissioned by State Government.",

Each master report covers one Local Government Area and is entitled ‘Housing Affordability – Demand and Supply by Local Government Area’. \nThe Demand for Supply for LGA reports are available online at: https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/housing-affordability-demand-and-supply-by-local-government-area\nExplanatory Notes:\nData sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Census for Population and Housing and it is updated every 5 years in line with the ABS Census. \nThe nature of the income imputation means that the reported proportion may significantly overstate the true proportion. Census housing stress data is best used in comparing results over Censuses (ie did it increase or decrease in an area) rather than using it to ascertain what proportion of households were in rental stress.\nIncome bands are based on household income.\nHigh income households can also experience rental stress. These households are included in the total but not identified separately. Data is representative of households in very low, low and moderate income brackets.\nPlease note that there are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data.

    "description": "Taken from sections of the Report:\r\n\r\nThe 2002-03 Mapping and Geographic Information Program (MAGIP) field season was undertaken from Davis Station. Nigel Peters from Sinclair Knight Merz undertook this season's fieldwork, the results of which are described in the following report.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nThe main objective for this season was to provide photo control mapping in the Rauer Group, with photo control also required at Davis Station and Marine Plains. A number of other tasks were undertaken in support of various scientific and engineering programs.\r\n\r\nThe tasks outlined in the surveyors brief are varied and numerous and have been included to provide the surveyor with a full and appropriate work program. The tasks are prioritised, usually with one or two major tasks with a number of minor tasks listed to be undertaken if the opportunity arises.

The data is based on modified 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has created a custom geometry combining the relevant SA2 boundaries for these results.\n\n",

The figure below shows some of the high-level economic variables that affect our tax forecasts.\n\nThe State’s taxation revenue is forecast by a process that involves:\n\napplication of DTF’s economic forecasts, where there is a relationship between taxation revenue and economic variables; and\nuse of forward indicators, unpublished revenue data and qualitative information from liaison with relevant stakeholders.\n\nThis enables an assessment of economic and other factors influencing the tax bases from which taxes are sourced e.g. for payroll tax, an assessment of the outlook for employment.\nWhere necessary, adjustment factors are used to account for other trends or events not captured by the forecasting models, such as impact of economic shocks or policy stimulus.\nThe spreadsheets below contain the nine taxation data series:\n\ntotal taxation revenue;\npayroll tax;\nland tax;\nland transfer duty;\ngambling taxes;\ninsurance taxes;\nfire services property levy;\nmotor vehicle taxes; and\nother taxes. \n",

    "description": "Data will be in the form of a report, which will be a secured (printable, non-editable), searchable, Portable Document Format (PDF) showing the results of the analyses. \nThe objective of WAMSI DREDGING SCIENCE NODE Project 4.4 is to examine the suitability of automated in situ sediment deposition sensors based essentially on an upward facing nephelometer (see Ridd et al. 2001) to assess sediment deposition. Prototype versions of this device developed by Peter Ridd at James Cook University - have been deployed in situ and although the sensor currently gives useful information, the shape of the sensor needs to be optimized and the sensor readings need to be calibrated against settled sediment surface density as measured in units of mg cm2. The objective of Project 4.4, which is being led by Peter Ridd at James Cook University, is to re-design, optimise and calibrate the deposition sensor head to more closely mimic the trapping of sediments on a coral's surface. The project will determine how the new sensor geometry responds to turbidity events and deposition events in situ and in the laboratory caused by different particle size distributions under different turbulence regimes. Once working, the deposition sensor will be used in the laboratory experiments (WAMSI DREDGING SCIENCE NODE Project Project 4.6).",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "title": "WAMSI 2 - Dredging Node - 3.1.1 - Review of Plume Characteristics",
    "description": "Predicting the distribution and fate for suspended sediment plumes associated with dredge operations may be achieved by advanced hydrodynamic modelling (REFS). The accuracy of the model outputs, or the level of confidence we associate with the modelled forecasts, depend to some degree on the model inputs, including parameters such as particle size distributions, particle densities, and particle settling rates.  There is potential to infer optical products from the modelled 3 dimensional plume distribution, including spectral light attenuation, and spectral light intensity at the substrate.  One of the approaches to testing or monitoring the accuracy of plume distribution models is to compare the modelled distributions to observed plume distributions. Optical remote sensing methods can provide reliable “maps” of plume extent, and reasonable estimates of various in-water geophysical parameters. Examples of remote sensing products include suspended sediment concentration, particle backscattering, and spectral light attenuation coefficients.\nThis review encompasses two main components:\n1) Satellite and in situ observations used to monitor sediment plumes and assess the suitability of the different sensor platforms to provide the spatial and temporal resolution needed for model validation and calibration in WAMSI Dredging Theme 3.4. Remote sensing platforms will include MODIS data and high resolution products such as WorldView and RapidEye;\n2) Available water quality data (such as TSS levels, light levels, sediment deposition rate, particle size distribution etc.) collected in Western Australia and associated with different types of dredges working in different geotechnical settings and metocean conditions.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Palmerston for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP after hours in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "One of the objectives of the Fisheries Management Act 1994 is to 'conserve key fish habitats'.\nTo achieve the objectives of the Fisheries Management Act, 1994 DPI-Fisheries has identified 'Key Fish Habitats' – those aquatic habitats that are important to the sustainability of the recreational and commercial fishing industries, the maintenance of fish populations generally, and the survival and recovery of threatened aquatic species.\nA policy definition of the term 'Key Fish Habitat' (KFH) was developed to guide the compilation of maps. KFH was defined to include all marine and estuarine habitats up to highest astronomical tide level (that reached by 'king' tides) and most permanent and semipermanent freshwater habitats including rivers, creeks, lakes, lagoons, billabongs, weir pools and impoundments up to the top of the bank.\nSmall headwater creeks and gullies (known as first and second order streams), that only flow for a short period after rain are generally excluded, as are farm dams constructed on such systems. Wholly artificial waterbodies such as irrigation channels, urban drains and ponds, salt and evaporation ponds are also excluded except where they are known to support populations of threatened fish or invertebrates.\nFeedback or questions relating to Key Fish Habitat Mapping data can be sent to:  fisheries.data@dpi.nsw.gov.au",

    "description": "This dataset provides daily average solar irradiance values for approximately 16,000 building footprints across Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia. It delivers rooftop-level estimates of solar radiation potential averaged by month, enabling rapid assessment of photovoltaic feasibility at the individual building scale.\n\nThe dataset was created to support distributed energy planning by combining Microsoft Bing building footprints (2D) with climate data from CSIRO and http://climate.onebuilding.org , processed through the LBNL Radiance lighting simulation suite. Each footprint includes monthly, daily and hourly averages (W/m²) calculated from hourly irradiance simulations based on TMYx climate files (2004-2018).\n\nThis resource is particularly valuable for building owners and property managers conducting preliminary PV feasibility studies, local governments developing renewable energy strategies, and researchers analysing urban solar potential at building resolution. The daily and monthly average formats provide accessible metrics for comparing seasonal variation and estimating annual energy generation potential without requiring processing of hourly data.\n\nCoverage includes 530 mesh blocks spanning Kalgoorlie, Boulder, and Trafalgar. Values represent rooftop-plane irradiance assuming flat surfaces and do not account for roof tilt, orientation variations, or shading from trees or adjacent structures. For detailed hourly analysis or specific panel configurations, users should reference the complementary hourly datasets in this collection.\n\nComprehensive technical documentation, including data dictionary, usage examples, and processing methodology, is available in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/DataSet-Information.pdf\">here</a>; software stack details and calculation workflows are documented in <a href=\"https://resources.aurin.org.au/ckan/resources/Software_Stack.pdf\">here</a>.",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for platypus. The data was developed by the University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate scores for platypus presented in the HWS for three scenarios:\n\n<ul><li>Current: habitat suitability for platypus under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.</li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability for platypus given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for platypus from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. </li></ul>\n\n\n\nHabitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. \n\n\n\nFurther reading: Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "AusCPR: Phytoplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk. It is thus possible to see the phytoplankton cells directly on the mesh. In essence, the phytoplankton is already concentrated. Washing the phytoplankton off the silks to count in the standard manner may result in loss of or damage to cells before analysis.\nIt is advised that anyone using the data should first read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.  For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal.

The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "The introduced European polychaete Sabella spallanzani  has become a dominant feature of sub-tidal habitats in south-eastern Australia.  This study examines the physical effects of Sabella spallanzanii on macrofaunal assembleges of soft sediments. The effects of S. spallanzanii on:  i) existing macrofaunal assemblege; ii) distribution of larvae and iii) colonisation of macrofauna were tested in sub-tidal soft sediments at Clifton Springs, Bellarine Peninsula, Port Phillip Bay, Victoria.     This dataset gives the macrofauna assemblege of soft sediment cores collected from five replicate plots, in each of four experimental treatments:  i) Real Sabella, a clump of 15 S. spallanzanii individuals transplanted from the surrounding region; ii) Mimic Sabella, a clump of 15 S. spallanzanii mimics;  iii) Control, undisturbed sediment without S. spallanzanii and  iv) Disturbed Control, disturbed sediments without S. spallanzanii.  Plots containing real and mimic Sabella were used to test if changes in the assemblage of macrofauna in the presence of Sabella could be attributed to physical effects alone.  A comparison of control and disturbed sediments was used to test if the disturbance created when transplanting Sabella into experimental plots contributed to any observed changes in the macrofauna assemblage. \n\nComparisons between Real (RS) and Mimic Sabella (MS), and Control (C) and Disturbed Control (DC) treatments were found not to differ significantly for any of the individual taxa or combined groups. Consequently, data from RS and MS treatments were pooled and compared against pooled data from C and DC treatments.  This analysis found that the presence of Sabella reduced the abundance of harpacticoid copepods, cumaceans and ostracods by more than 50% compared with numbers found in sediment without Sabella.  Collectively these taxa made up 80% of the total numbers of individuals in soil cores; as such the total number of individuals was also significantly reduced by the presence of Sabella.",

    "description": "Volumetric estimates of organic carbon being created by photosynthesis or consumed by ecosystem respiration.  Flow-MER deploys data loggers to record changes in dissolved oxygen, light and temperature over the course of 24 hours with continuous recording every 5 minutes. The data is analysed using the statistical model ‘BASEv2’ (BAyesian Single-station Estimation). The model (Grace et al. 2015) was updated during 2016 in accordance with methodological recommendations contained within Song et al. (2016).  Flow-MER converts these BASE volumetric estimates (this data set) into reach-scale estimates with the appropriate hydraulic information (cross-sectional area) to estimate the amount of organic carbon being created by photosynthesis or consumed by ecosystem respiration in a nominal 1 kilometre (km) stream reach at the gauging site.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\nGrace MR, Giling DP, Hladyz S, Caron V, Thompson RM, Mac Nally R (2015) Fast processing of diel oxygen curves: estimating stream metabolism with BASE (BAyesian Single-station Estimation).

The purpose of a CMP is to assist a school to return to, or maintain, a sustainable enrolment level and to assist children to be able to attend their local school.\nThe CMP outlines the enrolment criteria relevant to each school. The Department for Education has been implementing CMPs since 2009. Generally, the CMPs, over a period of time, have supported schools to manage enrolment demand within their school enrolment capacity. Further strategies include the provision of additional accommodation, implementation of a school zone or planning for new educational facilities.\nCMPs are approved by the Minister and published in the South Australian Government Gazette.\nRefer to the Capacity Management Plan webpage \nfor more information and links to the CMPs published in the South Australian Government Gazette.",

It is part of a hierarchical order of 4 datasets ranging from Subcatchments through Catchments and Basins to Divisions. The Subcatchments, Catchments and Basins are hierarchically ordered subsets of the Divisions dataset.\n\nCatchment boundaries have been defined for more than 3400 key sites on streams throughout Western Australia. The Subcatchments dataset contains polygons from which\nthe Catchment boundaries are derived. This catchments dataset is derived from this on the basis of the CATCH_NAME field, determined by the Scientific Custodian.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Hydrographic Catchments - Catchments (DOW-014)",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in New South Wales (NSW), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of New South Wales connected by Sydney trains (T1-T9) and Metro services (Metro North West line) have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "title": "Building Societies – Selected Assets and Liabilities",
    "description": "Building societies became authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) under the Banking Act 1959 on 1 July 1999 when responsibility for their prudential regulation shifted from the States and Territories to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). Since 1 July 1999, building societies have submitted monthly returns to APRA; prior to that date, they submitted returns to the Reserve Bank under the Financial Corporations Act 1974.  In September 2001, APRA implemented new reporting forms for building societies. From October 2001, data are derived from ARF 323.0: Statement of Financial Position (Licensed ADI). Since December 1999, series have only included data for building societies with total assets greater than or equal to $50 million.\r\n\r\nSelected assets:\r\n\r\n‘Cash and liquid assets’ is composed of ‘Cash’, ‘Balances with ADIs’ and ‘Other’. None of these items include bills of exchange, bills receivable, remittances in transit or certificates of deposit.\r\n\r\n‘Cash’ includes Australian and foreign currency notes and coins, gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates held as investments. It excludes loans repayable in gold bullion.\r\n\r\n‘Balances with ADIs’ includes deposits at call with Australian resident banks and other ADIs and settlement account balances due from banks and other ADIs, incorporating receivables for unsettled sales of securities.\r\n\r\n‘Other’ includes deposits at call with Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) and other financial institutions, net claims on recognised clearing houses in Australia, securities purchased under agreements to resell, funds held with the Reserve Bank and other central banks, and settlement account balances due from the Reserve Bank, other central banks, RFCs and other financial institutions, incorporating receivables for unsettled sales of securities.\r\n\r\n‘Government securities’, ‘ADI securities’, ‘Corporate paper’ and ‘Other securities’ include both trading and investment securities. Trading securities are recorded at net fair value. Investment securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for the amortisation of any premiums and discounts on purchase over the period of maturity.\r\n\r\n‘Government securities’ include securities issued by the Australian, State, Territory and local governments and State and Territory central borrowing authority (CBA) securities.\r\n\r\n‘ADI securities’ includes securities issued by banks and other ADIs, but not equity investments in parent, controlled or associated entities.\r\n\r\n‘Other securities’ includes asset-backed securities, other debt securities and equity securities, other than those issued by ADIs, but not equity investments in parent, controlled or associated entities.\r\n\r\n‘Residential’ includes both owner-occupied and investment housing loans to Australian households, net of specific provisions for doubtful debts.\r\n\r\n‘Personal’ includes revolving credit for a purpose other than housing, credit card liabilities, lease financing net of unearned revenue, and other personal term loans to Australian households net of specific provisions for doubtful debts.\r\n\r\n‘Commercial’ includes loans to public non-financial corporations, private trading corporations, private unincorporated businesses, community service organisations, Australian, State, Territory and local governments, ADIs and other financial institutions, net of specific provisions for doubtful debts. Loans to ADIs and other financial institutions includes loans to the Reserve Bank and other central banks, banks, other ADIs, RFCs, central borrowing authorities, fund managers, stockbrokers, insurance brokers, securitisers, mortgage, fixed interest and equity unit trusts and other financial intermediaries.\r\n\r\nSelected Liabilities:\r\n\r\n‘Borrowings from ADIs’ includes settlement account balances due to ADIs and both variable and fixed interest rate short-term loans from ADIs. A loan is reported as short-term if its residual term to maturity is one year or less.\r\n\r\n‘Deposits’ includes retail transaction call deposit accounts held by households, all other transaction call deposit accounts held by entities other than households, deposits from resident banks, resident non-bank financial institutions and intermediaries such as merchant banks, vostro balances from banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), the Australian-dollar equivalent of foreign currency deposits, deposits from controlled and associated entities, retail non-transaction call deposit accounts held by households, all other non-transaction deposit call accounts held by entities other than households, term deposits, certificates of deposit and other forms of deposits.\r\n\r\n‘Other’ liabilities includes settlement account balances due to RFCs and other financial institutions, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, promissory notes or commercial paper with a residual term to maturity of one year or less, other debt securities with a residual term of one year or less, variable interest rate short-term loans from counterparties other than ADIs, fixed interest rate short-term loans from counterparties other than ADIs, debt securities with a residual term to maturity of more than one year, variable and fixed interest rate loans and borrowings from Australian residents with a residual term to maturity of more than one year, interest accrued but not yet paid, interest received but not yet earned, unrealised losses on trading derivatives, items in suspense and other liabilities not separately identified above. A loan is reported as short-term if its residual term to maturity is one year or less. ‘Other’ liabilities do not include amounts due to clearing houses.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "    \n\nCalculated annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) potential evaporation (mm) for the\nperiod 1980-1999. Calculated by the Priestley-Taylor method. Interpretation:\nPotential evaporation is an expression of the amount of water that it should\nbe possible to evaporate from an open water surface given the prevailing solar\nradiation, air temperature, and air dryness conditions. Potential evaporation\nis generally high over the Australian continent, significantly exceeding\nrainfall in all but the wettest areas. It is extreme (approaching 10mm/day) in\nthe northern inland in summer. It decreases with decreasing solar radiation,\nthat is with increasing southern latitude and in winter. Potential evaporation\nalso decreases with proximity to coasts, because of increasing cloudiness.\nActual evaporation is controlled by the various resistances to moisture loss\noffered by plants and soil. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation.EvapPT.00, EvapPT.01 a| EvapPT.12 a Mean\nannual and monthly potential evaporation (mm)Data is in albers equal area, and\nunprojected using GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ampe_r9cl\n__01512a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

Previously, students in support classes in mainstream schools were not included.\n\n\nStudents in schools for specific purposes (SSPs) are not included.\n\n\nStudents in distance education and Opportunity Classes (OC) are included with their appropriate grade levels.\n\n\nIn most scholastic years there are a small number of students in atypical age groups. These have been included in the nearest band. This is indicated with an asterisk. As a result, the sum of each row may not equal the totals reported.

    "description": "As part of Phase Two of the National Landcare Program (NLP) the Australian Government’s natural resource management (NRM) investments will be delivered within NLP Management Units. The NLP Management Units dataset is maintained for the purpose of authoritative reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. It is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM investments might be delivered. This dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries (notwithstanding that some boundaries are defined by legislation in some states and territories). It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. Alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future, for example to accord with changes to NRM delivery arrangements or to reflect revisions of state/territory regional boundaries.Current VersionThe 2018 version NLP Management Units dataset contains 58 separate mapping objects. These comprise:56 mainland Management Units. A separate object for Lord Howe Island (part of North Coast, NSW Management Unit) A “Marine NRM” Management Unit which combines Australia's Territorial Sea (from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles) and Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (to 200 nautical miles). It excludes coastal waters (to 3 nautical miles) which are part of the terrestrial NLP Management Units. It also excludes Ashmore & Cartier Islands, Australian Antarctic Territory, Christmas Island, Cocos & Keeling Islands, Macquarie Island, Herd & MacDonald Islands and Norfolk Island, and those parts of Australia's Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone that surround these locations.The 2018 version was derived from the former NRM regions series (latest version was 2017), originally established in 2006 as the “Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries” dataset. No changes to the spatial alignment of terrestrial region boundaries was made in transitioning from NRM regions to NRM Management Units. The principle data fields in the 2018 version dataset are:NLP_MU (note this replaces the former NRM_Region field) State (state, territory or ‘external’for the Marine NRM unit)Area_Description (eg land area only, state and coastal waters, )NRM_ID (as described below)NRM_ID and NLP_MU names, grouped by state/territory, are as follows:New South Wales (11 Management Units + 1 extra map object for Lord Howe Island)1010 Central Tablelands1020 Central West1030 Greater Sydney1040 Hunter1050 Murray1060 North Coast (excludes Lord Howe Island)1061 North Coast - Lord Howe Island1070 North West NSW1080 Northern Tablelands1090 Riverina1100 South East NSW1110 WesternVictoria (10 Management Units)2010 Corangamite2020 East Gippsland2030 Glenelg Hopkins2040 Goulburn Broken2050 Mallee2060 North Central2070 North East2080 Port Phillip and Western Port2090 West Gippsland 2100 WimmeraQueensland (15 Management Units) 3010 Burnett Mary3020 Cape York3030 Condamine3040 Co-operative Management Area (between Cape York and Northern Gulf)3050 Desert Channels3060 Fitzroy3070 Burdekin 3080 Northern Gulf3090 Maranoa Balonne and Border Rivers 3100 Mackay Whitsunday3110 South East Queensland3120 South West Queensland3130 Southern Gulf3140 Wet Tropics3150 Torres StraitSouth Australia (8 Management Units) 4010 Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges4020 Alinytjara Wilurara4030 Eyre Peninsula4040 Kangaroo Island4050 Northern and Yorke4060 South Australian Arid Lands4070 South Australian Murray Darling Basin4080 South EastWestern Australia (7 Management Units)5010 Northern Agricultural Region5020 Peel-Harvey Region5030 Swan Region 5040 Rangelands Region5050 South Coast Region5060 South West Region5070 Avon River BasinTasmania (3 Management Units)6010 North West NRM Region6020 North NRM Region6030 South NRM RegionNorthern Territory (1 Management Unit)7010 Northern TerritoryAustralian Capital Territory (1 Management Unit)8010 ACTExternal (1 Management Unit) 9060 Marine NRMPrevious VersionsThe 2017 version updated the previous version (2016 version 2) with changes to region boundaries in Western Australia and NRM names in Qld, Tas and WA. The 2017 version also removed the NRM_BODY data (added for 2016 version 2) and the non-spatial OceanWatch map label previously included. The 2016 version 2 updated the marine portion of the NRM regions to be consistent with the current (2015) Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System (AMBIS) coastal water limit boundary. It also included a new four digit unique NRM_ID field for sorting purposes. The 2016 version 2 maintained definitions established in the 2015 version, including for the Peel-Harvey NRM region and for the OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation (not spatially defined). It also maintained changes made in earlier versions including: the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas; and the 2012 update/formalisation of the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset.Data to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018",
