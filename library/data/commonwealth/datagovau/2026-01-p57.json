    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. New sinkhole and waterhole data for the Beetaloo GBA region, interpreted as part of GBA from remote sensing information. It includes locations and descriptions of dams, sinkholes, waterholes, circular clay filled depressions and ephemeral wetlands in the region. Waterholes and sinkholes are particularly prevalent in western Beetaloo GBA region. The sinkholes, waterholes and wetlands often appear to occur in clusters, and can be associated with depressions that can be over 1000m across. Some features may also occur adjacent to large palaeo-valleys, or in abandoned stream channels. Others seem to align with geological lineaments. Some sinkholes appear to be quite recent and contain little vegetation, whereas others are older and contain thick stands of trees.  It is likely than many of sinkholes and depressions are forms of pesudo-karst that have formed in deeply weathered regolith on the Carpentaria Basin. Where the Carpentaria Basin is thin there is potential for sinkholes and conduits to intersect with limestone karst (sinkholes and conduits) that occur in the Cambrian Limestone Aquifer.  \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nPoints were manually interpreted from remote sensing data. Underlying datasets used to help with interpretation and targeting areas of interest include: Remote sensing images for Beetaloo GBA region - regolith ratios and barest earth (Available at: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/0e84fa22-f397-489c-b99a-6492bf010613) and Digital Earth Australia Waterbodies (Available at: https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/132814).  The following columns are included in the dataset 1. Type - these are Dams, Waterholes (naturally occurring features), sinkholes, Ephemeral wetlands and depression. 2. Description - includes information on feature shape, vegetation etc., 3. Dimension, an estimate of longest dimension (in metres) 4. Name- whether the locality has a name. 5. Water - whether the feature is wet, damp or dry. 6 Source. data used to identify the feature. These include DEA (digital earth Australia polygons, RS (remote sensing regolith images), Imagery (aerial photography) or NT got (rangelands waterholes and sinkholes). Latitude and Longitude",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, April 05, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, April 07, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

Indicative Boundary, subject to further detailed assessment</li>\r\n<li> 3. Springfield Structure Plan Designations</li>\r\n<li> 4. Designation of Land for Community Infrastructure</li>\r\n<li> 5. Recorded Approvals</li>\r\n<li> 6. Notations</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n##Ipswich Planning Scheme\r\n\r\nThe 2006 Consolidated Ipswich Planning Scheme covers the entire local government area. In most instances it includes roads and watercourses. The Planning Scheme was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the repealed Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) and the Department of Local Government and Planning guidelines and scheme template.\r\n\r\nCouncil adopted the Consolidated Planning Scheme (including all amendments to the 2004 Ipswich Planning Scheme) on 14 December 2005, and took effect (ie commencement date) on 23 January 2006.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme divides the Ipswich Local Government Area into 8 localities-\r\n\r\nUrban Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nCity Centre\r\n\r\n\r\nRegionally Significant Business Enterprise and Industry Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nAmberley\r\n\r\n\r\nRosewood\r\n\r\n\r\nTownship Areas\r\n\r\n\r\nRural Areas, and\r\n\r\n\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach locality is further divided into Zones and in some cases, Sub Areas and Precincts. The planning scheme also provides a secondary organisational layer called Overlays, which are based on special attributes of land that need to be protected, or that may constrain development. There are two types of overlays - character places overlays and development constraints overlays.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Scheme uses the concepts of Overall Outcomes, Specific Outcomes, Probable Solutions and Acceptable Solutions for a zone, overlay or code.\r\n\r\nOverall Outcomes are essentially the overall purpose or intent statements. Specific Outcomes are the more detailed performance objectives.\r\n\r\nProbable Solutions represent one way of achieving a specific outcome and may be either increased or decreased by the Local Government depending on the individual circumstances of the proposal.\r\n\r\nAcceptable Solutions apply only to self-assessable development and represent a precise measure for compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the zoning of a property, it is also imperative to refer to the overlay maps and associated overlay codes (see Part 11) in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development compared to the underlying zone, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nAlso, in addition to the overlays affecting a property, it is also imperative to refer to the zoning maps and associated zone codes in the planning scheme as these may change the relevant assessment category of development, or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nData made available under CC-BY-ND terms.\r\nData updated on changes to Scheme.",

    "title": "IMOS - ACORN - Capricorn Bunker Group HF ocean radar site (Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia)",
    "description": "The Capricorn Bunker Group site is in the southern region  of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park World Heritage Area (GBR).  The HF ocean radar coverage is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  This is an area where the East Australian Current (EAC) meanders as it moves south from the Swain Reefs and loses touch with the western land boundary.  The area is dynamic with warm EAC water recirculating and being wind-driven northwards along the coast inside the GBR lagoon.  The recirculating warm water contrasts with the upwelling tendency of the parts of the EAC which continue to move southwards.  The CBG radar is ideally placed to follow filaments of different water types and to investigate their impacts on coral reefs and fisheries.  \n\nApplications of the CBG radar data are in the frequency and location of regional upwelling that fuels productivity, and in the connectivity between reefs and islands.  At the central point of the CBG area of coverage is the  Heron Island Research Station which hosts many coral reef and ecology research programs.  The data will also be useful for validation of the operational Bluelink model, and the embedded higher resolution Whole-of-Reef model.   \n\nThe CBG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element receive arrays located at Tannum Sands (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) and Lady Elliot Island (-24.111 S, 152.713 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.348 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nThe capital funding for this system was provided originally as an ARC LEIF Grant, assisted by contributions from James Cook University, The University of Queensland, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in April 2017.",

After this time, Queensland Health moved to a quarterly reporting format for Elective Surgery and Emergency Department performance. This change was to align with the Queensland Health Hospital Performance site which supports greater consistency of other performance related activity across Hospital and Health Services.\n• Quarterly data from October 2020 can be found at https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/elective-surgery\n• There is a gap in data from March 2020 to September 2020 due to the national agreement to suspend public reporting of hospital performance.",

The data uses 2014 Non-ABS ASGS boundaries. \nThe NRP is designed for users interested in the socio-economic and environmental characteristics of regions - and in comparisons with similar geographies across Australia. Data are arranged under the broad themes/topics of Economy, Industry, People, and Energy and Environment. \nPlease note some data are not available for all reference years, for a variety of reasons. For example; there may be conceptual breaks in a data series; the collection frequency may be irregular; some series may have revisions pending; or permission to publish in the NRP may have only been granted recently. In addition, some data series are not available for the full range of geographies. The reasons can include: data owner or custodian preferences; industry identification with a few, particular geographies only; confidentiality protection; and the presence of many suppressed data cells (at smaller geographic levels) thus making true aggregations up to larger ASGS regions difficult. \nThis data is ABS data used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Please note National Regional Profile (1379.0.55.001) has been discontinued.

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R0.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, October 21, 2010\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, October 27, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "In 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to obtain orthophotography of Christmas Island. The survey was carried out using a fixed wing aircraft between the 24th and 26th of August 2011. All imagery was captured using a DiMAC UltraLight 50mmm Lens camera within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from\n0.5m to 1.2m. The photo frame and tide height table lists the approximate tide height for each raw photo. Using an automated process, raw images were joined to form a mosaic of the island. Colour balancing and replacement of certain areas with alternate raw images was performed for consistency. The imagery has a 15cm on ground resolution. \n\nThe orthophotography was provided to Geoscience Australia in GDA94. It has been converted to UTM WGS 84 zone 48s using ESRI ArcMap.\n\nAAM advised that the imagery is accurate to 30cm.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "This data set contains mapped and gridded data from TOPEX/Poseidon (NASA/CNES), Jason-1 (CNES/NASA) and from ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat (ESA). At any given time data from all available satellites is included in the mapped and gridded data product. At times only data for TOPEX/Poseidon is available. This is indicated in one of the fields in the data file. Up to about mid-2003 the data is from TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-1/2. The next generation of satellites (Jason-1 and Envisat) take over after that. The data is on a 1/3rd degree Mercator grid - the longitude grid spacing is always 1/3rd degree. The latitude grid spacing is 1/3rd of a degree at the equator, but gets smaller with distance from the equator. This data set is in a relatively easy to use format. The data was provided by Aviso/CNES in France and has been reformatted into a netCDF file at CSIRO Marine Research in Hobart. Available on-line on the CSIRO Marine Research network; also available to outside users on request.",

    "description": "This report describes a program of simulated car crashes and examinations designed to evaluate the child restraints currently available in Australia. Each restraint was subjected to crash simulations producing deceleration forces equal to 17 times the weight of the occupant. During each crash, data such as harness forces, deceleration and velocity were recorded and high speed movies were provided. It was concluded that, in general, SAA-approved devices afforded a degree of protection adequate to ensure survival of the occupant in most real life frontal collisions; there were, however, some aspects of approved devices which could have been improved. In general, non-approved devices were considered inadequate, in at least some respects; some devices could easily be modified to satisfy safety requirements. The report concludes with detailed appraisals of 21 commercial products manufactured in Australia, Canada, Britain or the United States of America.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This resource was originally published on opengov.nsw.gov.au.

The ecosystem approach is necessary, especially to account for fishery-ecosystem interactions, but by itself is not sufficient to address two important factors contributing to unsustainable fisheries - inappropriate incentives bearing on fishers, and the ineffective governance that frequently exists in commercial, developed fisheries managed primarily by total harvest limits and input-controls. We contend that much greater emphasis must be placed on fisher motivation when managing fisheries. Using evidence from more than a dozen ?natural experiments? in commercial fisheries, we argue that incentive-based approaches that better specify community, individual harvest, or territorial rights and also price ecosystem services - coupled with public research, monitoring and effective oversight - promote sustainable fisheries.",

By identifying where future development will occur, the ULDO also supports other documents released by the WAPC. The 2016/17 release of the ULDO includes residential, special residential, special rural, industrial, commercial and tourism land uses. Within the residential land uses, the ULDO captures future fringe and infill development of five dwellings or more and single and multi-dwelling developments. \nThe ULDO seeks to provide a better understanding of the supply chain and the current status of various development initiatives to coordinate the supply and timely delivery of land to the Perth metropolitan and Peel regions.",

No data has changed.\r\n \r\nThis package of nationally consistent Australian spatial layers at one-kilometre resolution contains publicly available national data for use with MCAS-S up until December 2022. It replaces the 2014, 2011 and 2009 MCAS-S data packs. The downloadable zip file (1GB unzips to 4GB) contains a sample MCAS-S project alongside a data folder. Within the data folder are more than 290 layers in four sub-folders: Primary (raster data in GeoTIFF format for analysis) ~269 layers, Mask (raster data in GeoTIFF format for reporting and restricting the view) ~13 layers (note that categorical primary layers can now be used as masks by modifying the .tip file), Overlay (vector data in shapefile format – point, line, or polygons for context) ~17 layers, and Classified (empty folder for storage of layers created by using MCAS-S).\r\nThe layers in the Data pack are listed in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet MCAS-S-datapack2022-contents.xlsx.\r\nFor instructions to use this data pack read the descriptive metadata.\r\n\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: ABARES 2022, Multi-Criteria Analysis Shell for\r\nSpatial Decision Support MCAS-S Data pack – update 2022, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and\r\nSciences, Canberra, December 2022 CC BY 4.0.

    "description": "This dataset presents details of buildings works approved in Australia for the 2013-2014 financial year. The data has been aggregated and presented by Local Government Areas (LGA) 2013 boundaries.\nStatistics of building work approved are compiled from: permits issued by local government authorities and other principal certifying authorities; contracts let or day labour work authorised by commonwealth, state, semi-government and local government authorities; and major building approvals in areas not subject to normal administrative approval e.g. building on remote mine sites.\nThe scope of the collection comprises the following: construction of new buildings; alterations and additions to existing buildings; approved non-structural renovation and refurbishment work; and approved installation of integral building fixtures. The statistics include all approved residential building valued at $10,000 or more and all approved non-residential building valued at $50,000 or more.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data from the ABS.\n\n\nThe data has been sourced from the June 2015 release.\n\n",

    "title": "Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and Non-CALD Populations (2016)",
    "description": "This dataset provides a composite measure of heat vulnerability for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations in Australia, integrating three key indicators: heat exposure, heat sensibility, and heat adaptive capability. Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who are obese. Adults were classified as obese if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in BreastScreen Australia for women ages 50 to 74, by age group. The national breast cancer screening program, BreastScreen Australia began in 1991. It aims to reduce illness and death from breast cancer using screening mammography for early detection of unsuspected breast cancer in women. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic boundaries from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of women in the population aged 50-74 screened by BreastScreen Australia over 2 calendar years. The population denominator was the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 50-74 within the relevant geographical area for the relevant 2-year reporting period.\n\n\nAn SA3 was assigned to women using a postcode to SA3 correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to an SA3 and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nSA3s with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed.\n\n\nSA3 data for the Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cotter - Namadgi, Fyshwick - Piallago - Hume, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay, and Lord Howe Island were excluded due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia changed its target age group from 50-69 years to 50-74 years from July 2013; participation is reported for both the previous and current target age groups to allow comparison of trends with previously reported data.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n",

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\n1. JP - recent– Juvenile period as years until 50% of individuals in the population have flowered \nunder recent conditions (30-year period centred on 1990) based on a model featuring the \nenvironmental variables mean annual precipitation, annual mean minimum temperature and \ngross primary productivity. (Fig 5 a in Gosper et al. 2022) \n2.

    "description": "<b>Version 29 January 2020</b>\nMoreton Bay Regional Council  planning scheme supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. Please use this data in conjunction with the North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "The NSW Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey (PSDES) collects information about the main destinations of recent school leavers in the 6 to 12 months after leaving school.\nData Notes\n\n\nThe survey collected data on school leavers in the 6-12 months after leaving school in 2023, School leavers comprise students who completed Year 12 and students who left school while they were in Year 10, 11 or 12 (early school leavers).\n\n\nThere are some caveats and limitations in the generalisability of survey findings to the total population of recent school leavers in NSW. For example, students who completed Year 12 via an alternative pathway other than the HSC, such as the International Baccalaureate, are not counted as Year 12 completers and are not covered in the survey.\n\n\nPrior to 2021 a stratified sampling approach was used for the mainstream Year 12 completer survey (excluding Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and non-Connected Community school leavers). The sampling strategy for this group changed to a census for the first time in 2021 and resulted in a marked increase in the overall proportion of responses collected from the target population.\n\n\nTime series data of destinations by student type from 2014 to 2018 should be used with caution as some counts of school leavers are estimated from lower cell counts than in later years. Estimates in the data are based on base weights which are adjusted to matched population distributions for school leaver characteristics to minimise non-response bias.\n\n\nEach table shows population estimates (as column totals) for each grouping variable and leaver type combination as well as weighted percentages for each of the 10 main destination categories included in the survey. Population estimates and destination percentage breakdowns are also included for all leavers (across leaver type). Findings are reported at a system level (across leavers from government and non-government schools).\n\n\nFor a full description of notes and caveats, see the 2023 Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey Technical Report\n\n\nSee the 2023 Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey, Annual Report and fact sheets\n\n\nData Source\nNSW Post-School Destinations and Experiences Survey\nAvailable tables in this dataset:\n\nTable 1 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and survey year (2014 to 2023).\nTable 2 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and gender (as self-identified) for 2023 only.\nTable 3 provides a breakdown of main destination by leaver type and Aboriginal status (as self-identified) for 2023 only.\n",

These reserves build on previous MPAs, including those in the South-east CMR Network declared in 2007, to form Australia’s system of Commonwealth marine reserves.\n\nAn independent review of the CMRs proclaimed in 2012 was undertaken between September 2014 and December 2015, with a view to informing statutory management plans for the CMRs. \n \nThis dataset contains spatial and contextual advice for zoning boundaries as recommended by the Bioregional Advisory Panel for the Commonwealth Marine Reserves Review. The dataset does not reflect Australian Government policy. It does not include data on MPAs in other Australian jurisdictions (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, State/Territory parks), or terrestrial protected areas with marine components (e.g. Pulu Keeling National Park), nor does it include the South-east CMR Network which was not included in the Commonwealth Marine Reserves Review.

    "description": "This dataset presents final estimates for the water usage of agricultural businesses in Australia by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the 2015-16 Agricultural Census. Categories included are statistics on water use, water sources, irrigation expenditure and irrigation methods. Data is aggregated to 2011 ASGS SA2 boundaries.\nThe Agricultural Census is conducted once every five years. The scope of the 2015-16 Agricultural Census was all businesses undertaking agricultural activity recorded on the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Business Register (ABSBR) above a minimum threshold applied to the estimated value of their agricultural operations. The threshold for the 2015-16 Agricultural Census was all agricultural businesses with an Estimated Value of Agricultural Operations (EVAO) of $40,000 or greater. This is a change from previous ABS Rural Environment and Agricultural Collections, where a  EVAO threshold of $5,000 or greater was used. As a result of the change in scope, the estimates from the 2015-16 Agricultural Census will not be directly comparable to previously published Agricultural Censuses or annual Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodity Survey outputs. The 2015-16 Census final estimates are based on the achieved target response rate of 85% from an in-scope population of approximately 103,400 agricultural businesses. \nThe estimates in this dataset are based on information obtained from agricultural businesses that responded to the 2015-16 Agricultural Census. However, since not all of the businesses that were selected provided data, the estimates are subject to sampling variability; that is, they may differ from the figures that would have been produced if information had been collected from all businesses. Most published estimates have relative standard errors (RSEs) less than 10%. For some states and territories with limited production of certain commodities, RSEs are greater than 10%. Estimates with an RSE greater than 50% are considered too unreliable for general use and hence have been removed from the data.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 4618.0) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information on the dataset please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note: \n\n\nEstimates with an RSE value greater than 50% and are considered too unreliable for general use and have been removed from the data\n\n\nWhere data was not published or not applicable the records have been set to null\n\n",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Resource Management in Asia-Pacific (RMAP) Program based at The Australian National University in Canberra.\n*****\nIn this paper we examine the strengths and weaknesses of state-supported Customary Marine Tenure (CMT) systems in two independent Melanesian states in the context of burgeoning commercial and subsistence fisheries. Both Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands can be categorised as 'weak states' where access by foreign-owned fishing companies to state-owned resources (e.g. tuna) is typically easy to obtain by bribing the relevant politicians and bureaucrats at national and/or provincial level. By contrast, access to near-shore fishery resources necessitates negotiation with the landowners of adjacent coastal zones, and this in itself can provide some level of resource protection. However the expansion of markets and rapid increases in populations in the region are exerting pressures on subsistence and commercial fisheries that are already creating significant problems. In the Solomon Islands the recent collapse of the state in a militia coup has also meant that any escalation in marine resource piracy is likely to proceed unchecked and indeed in many cases unnoticed and unreported. The management tool of choice for multi-species fisheries across the world, and particularly in cash-poor developing countries is the Marine Protected Area (MPA), and this system has proved quite successful in many instances, particularly in rich, industrialised countries. However, with some exceptions, typical Melanesian CMT regimes make MPAs difficult to establish because many coastal zones are finely divided along clan boundaries, such that few clans would be willing to 'lock up' their own reefs for the benefit of neighbouring clans. How then can local communities in these countries most effectively manage their marine resources in an environment of escalating fishing pressure and weak governance? In this essay we analyse the social and institutional contexts of near-shore community-based fishery resource management, and explore options for the future. We look at the potential utility of educating reef owners about aspects of the life cycle of marine organisms that are mostly absent from local knowledge systems and how this information could empower villagers to better formulate their own management regimes.",

    "description": "The data set contains airborne pollen concentrations (grains per cubic meter) from samples taken at Campbelltown site, New South Wales, Australia (-34.0721, 150.8056) between July 2016 and June 2020. Each data row has two concentrations: one for grass (Poaceae) and one for all other pollens. For comparison with other data sets and between pollen seasons the data weeks start at July 1 each calendar year. Extra days at the end of the pollen year are included in week 52. Each data row has a collection period start date, the number of days within the collection period (7-9), and the number of days on which pollen was collected and summed (0-9). Concentrations represent only the number of days collected and not always the full collection period, as indicated.  \nAirborne pollen samples were collected using a volumetric continuous flow impaction sampler (Burkard Manufacturing, UK), stained with fuchsin and counted by light microscopy according to best practice described in the Australian Airborne Pollen and Spore Monitoring Network Interim Standard and Protocols (Version 2, 14 September 2018).\nData may be used for modelling and forecasting airborne grass, other, total pollen levels. Other uses include analysis of the effect of pollen levels on asthma and allergy presentations, or in inference of grass and other vegetation growth patterns. Data may also be used for evaluation of medium or long-term trends over time or comparison withpollen exposure levels between spatial distant locations.\nMetadata about this and other AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network monitoring sites is provided on the National Environmental Monitoring Site Register. Information about other pollen and spores monitored can be found by the AusPollen Aerobiology Collaboration Network Species Classification on the ARDC Research Vocabularies site.\nAURIN has added latitude, longitude and spatialised geometry columns for each row based on the coordinates of the pollen samples. Periods over which no data is available are marked as null.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nVector and raster representation of the ACRD drawdown extents for the 5th, 50th and 95th quantiles for three depth thresholds 0.2m, 2m and 5m. Used for mapping.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nACRD drawdown values per Assessment unit were taken from the input csv files and joined to  the input Assessment unit layer. Through series of selections and dissolving (ArcGIS tool DISSOLVE) a series of vector and raster footprint layers were created for the various each combination of quantile and depth threshold. The quantiles being 5 (q05), 50 (q50)and 95 (q95). The threshold depths being 0.2m (gt02), 2m (gt20) and 5m (gt50).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) HUN Quantile footprints v01.

For more information refer to the Water Data Online information sheet\nThe time period over which data is available varies according to how long the stations have been operating. The period of record for some locations starts in the late 19th century. Water Data Online does not display near real time, or flood data. Water Data Online also contains historical data from some stations that are no longer being operated.

    "description": "The Murray-Darling Basin Plan (available at http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012L02240) was developed under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007and aims to deliver a coordinated approach to water use by States and Territories in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), underpinned by a commitment to restoring the long-term health of rivers and wetlands in the Basin. To achieve this, the Basin Plan sets a long term average Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) for surface water and groundwater use across the major valleys in the MDB, and incorporates an Environmental Watering Plan (EWP) that ensures surplus water beyond SDLs is made available for the natural floodplain and wetland systems. The EWP is central to the Basin Plan as it aims to achieve the best possible environmental outcomes in its use of environmental water, in terms of size, timing and nature of river flows. The EWP is supported by the Environmental Water Recovery Strategy, a voluntary water buyback instrument (SEWPAC 2012).\nThe long term average SDL for surface water flow is currently set by the Basin Plan at 10,873 gigalitres per year (GL/y). This includes 3,468 GL/y for the northern Basin, which establishes a water ‘saving’ of 390 GL/y from water allocations previously set under the Living Murray initiative (MDBA 2011). These savings are available as ‘environmental water’ which is regulated by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO) via the EWP.\nWater allocations in the northern Basin are currently under review via the Northern Basin Review, which is due for finalisation in mid-2016. This review is expected to improve environmental science in relation to floodplain systems in the Condamine-Balonne and Barwon-Darling River systems, and may recommend changes to the Basin Plan accordingly. A key part of the Review is to improve knowledge about environmental assets within river systems of the northern Basin (e.g. floodplain and wetland vegetation, fish, water birds), and how they respond and interact to fluctuations in surface water flow. Improved knowledge about the native vegetation of inland floodplain systems is fundamental to the Northern Basin Review.\nTo improve information about the distribution and extent of floodplain and wetland vegetation types in the northern Basin, Eco Logical Australia (ELA) was commissioned by the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to map the distribution of plant community types (PCTs) within a large section of the Darling floodplain west of Louth, and within the Condamine-Balonne system south of the NSW-Queensland border. An improved knowledge about the distribution and extent of floodplain PCTs will inform how environmental water allocations might be refined, and is thus an important component of the Northern Basin Review.\nAttributes:\nPCT_ID = NSW Plant Community Type Code \nPCT_LABEL = Plant Community Type Label \nBROAD_VEG = Broad Vegetation Type\nHYDROL_ECOL = Hydro-Ecological Functional Group\nVEG_FORMAT = Vegetation Formation\nVEG_CLASS = Vegetation Class\nFloodplain = Floodplain vegetation (yes or no)\nMAP_LABEL = Short vegetation label suitable for display on map products\nRE = Regional Ecosystem Code\nRE_LABEL = Regional Ecosystem Label\nACCURACY = Attribute accuracy (values 1 to 5)\n5 - Verified in the field by either full floristic, rapid or API (observational) site \n4 - Not verified in the field but likely to be correct due to extrapolation from similar verified pattern or verified in field but uncertain of boundary\n3 - Probably correct although could be one of a few related communities\n2 - Possibly correct but might be one of several other communities\n1 - Unlikely to be correct\nFor more information please refer to the technical report.
