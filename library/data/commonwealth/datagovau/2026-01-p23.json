    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2014 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 1,126,441 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either:  \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed.  \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2014 car parking event data there are 3,377 records where the parking event goes into 2015 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.56GB, 51.5 million rows)",

    "description": "The prevalence of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in and around the Galactic center and the bulge has been one of the key questions in pulsar astronomy. In addition to finding more exotic and interesting binary systems at and around the Galactic center and bulge due to the enhanced density of stars/stellar remnants, MSPs are also proposed to be one of the candidates to explain the observed Fermi gamma-ray excess. However, most of the MSPs discovered so far are field (disk) MSPs or those in globular clusters. Initial steps towards addressing the question of Galactic center/bulge MSPs were made with the discovery of the first MSPs in a Galactic filament, but more progress comes from the discovery of a sample of MSPs around the Galactic center. Blind surveys targeting MSPs can suffer from many observational biases that smear the pulses due to binary acceleration, scattering from the enhanced density, and so on, which increases the parameter space for discovery and can sometimes make the problem intractable. However, if pulsar candidates can be identified reliably from imaging surveys, then targeted observations can make the problem tractable in identifying the pulsations. We followed up a sample of polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT bulge imaging survey and discovered a sample of 16 new MSPs. Here we request the timing observations of 8 interesting MSPs (a subset of our discovery sample), to study the binary nature of these sources and their potential inclusion in pulsar timing array efforts.",

    "description": "Age of individual fish collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nAbundance and diversity of riverine fish populations are monitored annually at fixed sites within six Selected Areas using a standardised sampling regime involving boat or backpack electrofishing and fine mesh fyke nets (referred to as Category 1 sampling). These methods target large-bodied and small-bodied fish species respectively. A sample of measured individuals (length and weight) were collected for otolith sectioning and age determination to construct age vs length and weight relationships.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Fish Age.

    "description": "Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) - Vegetation Complexes - SWF50k\n\nThe dataset is a comprehensive coverage of pre-1750 distribution of vegetation complexes of the south west forest region of Western Australia. This 1:50,000 mapping was undertaken by Mattiske and Havel (1998) as part of the biodiversity assessment for the comprehensive regional assessment for the south west forest region. The outputs from this project were used as inputs to the assessments of national estate, ecologically sustainable forest management, endangered species and the integration of all these values in the 1999 Regional Forest Agreement (RFA). This dataset covers the full extent mapped by Mattiske and Havel (1998) not just the area within the RFA boundary.\nIn March 2015 the dataset was reviewed to correct known and documented minor attributing errors and additional fields were incorporated including a unique numerical identifier (SWFor_ID). \n\nWebb et al. (2016) reviewed the 1:50,000 mapping of the Whicher Scarp and changes were made to ensure the complexes were a continuation of those defined by Mattiske and Havel (1998) and the extent of the landform correlated to that as defined by soil-landscape mapping (DAFWA 2007). In addition the review consolidated the boundaries along the Whicher and Darling Scarp interface with the Swan Coastal Plain. All Swan Coastal Plain complexes were removed and incorporated into the 2016 mapping of the “Swan Coastal Plain Vegetation Complexes” (Webb et al. 2016). ",

    "description": "The Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network (ACORN) facility comprises a coordinated network of HF radars delivering real-time, non-quality controlled and delayed-mode, quality controlled surface current data into a national archive. \n\nBased on experience in Europe and the USA, deployment of these radars is expected to make a profound change to coastal ocean research in Australia. HF radar provides unprecedented time-resolved surface current maps over the monitoring sites for physical and biological ocean research. \n\nDeployment of the radars is in support of regional nodes where there is a range of identified questions concerned with boundary currents and associated eddies and their interactions with shelf water and topography. In turn these are linked to productivity, connectivity of biological populations and phenomena such as coral bleaching and diseases. It provides a basis for applied research in wave prediction and offers test sites for hydrodynamic modelling. \n\nThe equipment comprises long-range WERA and medium-range WERA systems and long-range SeaSonde systems, and associated spares and transport infrastructure. An existing system that was installed by James Cook University in the Capricorn/Bunker region around Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef was integrated into the network. An HF radar acquisition by a consortium led by South Australian Research and Development Institute in South Australia was also integrated into the network.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

It is also important to note that an Incident Control Site whether it be a fixed or field ICC site can also be used as an Operations Point or Staging Area. DBCA does not purport that the information contained in this shapefile represents the only sites/all sites that are potentially available to be used as FFICC-Fixed Facility Incident Control Centre, FICCS- Field Incident Control Centre Sites.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is an extract for the Hunter subregion of the soil thickness data from the ASRIS Continental-scale soil property predictions 2001. The source data are the Surface of predicted Thickness of soil layer 1 (A Horizon - top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.  Data modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State and CSIRO and presented as .0.01 degree grid cells. \n\n\n\nThe dataset consists of statistics for soils depths (MIN, MAX, RANGE, MEAN, STD, MEDIAN) for each of the simulation catchments in the AWRA-L model. The soil thickness data were resampled to the model grid (BILO cells - 0.05 degree grid cells) and the catchments are defined by the BILO cells which fall within them. The gauging station ID in the spreadsheet defines the gauges which were used to define the upstream catchment area.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nUsed to define soils thickness in the AWRA-L model.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe soil thickness data were resampled to the model grid (BILO cells - 0.05 degree grid cells). Statistics for soils depths (MIN, MAX, RANGE, MEAN, STD, MEDIAN) for each of the simulation catchments in the AWRA-L model were calculated using the Zonal Statistics as Table tool within ArcGIS with the simulation catchments used as the zone dataset. The output table was used to populate the excel spreadsheet with the Station ID and catchments areas added.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) HUN AWRA-L ASRIS soil properties v01.

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 6.1 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia.  85 biogeographic regions and 405 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia.  \nThe IBRA Version 6.1 data consists of two datasets.  IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. \n\nIBRA Version 6.1 is the result of refinement of the IBRA Version 5.1 and version 6.0 boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories and also based on alterations by the states/territories along the state borders.  The refined boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies.  Those jurisdictions to refine their data in this version of IBRA include New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.  There are 53 newly named sub regions and 5 have been renamed from version 5.1.  Whilst there has been a refinement of sub-regional and associated bioregional boundaries in Qld, Vic and western NSW, the new sub-regions are found principally in eastern NSW.  In WA changes relate to moving the western boundary of Yalgoo bioregion to the coast, truncating the northern portion of the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion.\n\nNominal attributes that make up IBRA are: climate, lithology/geology, landform, vegetation, flora and fauna, and landuse.  The use of these attributes varies across the jurisdictions and for further information individual jurisdictions should be contacted.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.

    "description": "Crabs sometimes vacate their territories due to continued harassment by their neighbours. To determine whether male-female pairs were longer lasting than male-male pairs, we documented the number of crabs that were still present in their same burrow after 24 hours. 20 Focal males were selected: 10 with male nearest neighbours and 10 with female nearest neighbours. The following day, at the same time relative to low tide, we determined whether the crabs were in the same burrows. Data recorded included: the tidal height and time, and whether each crab was present or not. A new set of 20 pairs were marked each day over a period of 26 days. \n\nThe data suggests the crabs were less likely to change burrows during neap tides. Males with female neighbours also tended to be more stable than males with male neighbours.",

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual retained catch (meaning the catch that is not returned to the sea) in kilograms, by species and fishery, for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). \r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea, where generally the weights are estimates only. Fish discarded at sea are not included in this dataset. Location of catches within a fishery is not included.\r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Fishers usually cannot accurately weigh fish at sea, so the estimated weights are mostly based on volume (i.e. the size and number of boxes of fish caught). Catch data are used in combination with gear, effort, and spatial data to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may filter out catches from their assessments because of data quality issues or group species differently. In addition, the data may be different in other datasets with different summations such as catch by season or catch from the date fish were landed at port.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect catches each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as: total allowable catch, closures of fishing areas, reducing boat numbers, or banning the catch of a particular species. Similarly, changes in market demand can affect which species are targeted. \r\nWhen the fish are landed at port, the accurate weight of fish is recorded in AFMA catch disposal records by both the fisher and fish receiver permit holder. This information can be found in the “Reported landed annual catch from Commonwealth fisheries catch disposal records” and its metadata, which is published on data.gov.au. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in the species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness, and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset defines the boundaries of the 80 groundwater SDL resource units in the Murray-Darling Basin described in Schedule 4 of the Basin Plan. These include 11 groundwater SDL resource units for deep groundwater that lie beneath the groundwater SDL resource units.\r\n2 of the groundwater SDL resource units (GS17, GS41) have different boundaries in their surface expression and in deep groundwater and therefore are shown with both a Groundwater and Deep Groundwater extent.\r\nIn some areas, there are SDL resource units that overlap one another (eg: GS1).

    "description": "(Abstract from 'The ducks of Macquarie Island')\n\nEarly reference to waterfowl on Macquarie Island and observations made by ANARE expeditioners between 1949 and 1985 are reviewed and discussed.  Apart from a unique (perhaps erroneous) record of a mute swan Cygnus olor, information is restricted to the Pacific black duck Anas superciliosa, the grey teal A. gibberifrons and the alien mallard A. platyrhynchos and its hybrids.\n\nBlack duck and grey teal were seen by early visitors to the Island, but despite the infrequent potential for escapes of domestic ducks, mallards were not recorded until 1949.  Occasional teal and mallards were seen in the years following the establishment of the permanent scientific station (1948) but mallards (and hybrids) have become more numerous in recent years.  Though grey teal may disperse to Macquarie Island in times of drought on the Australian mainland, the source of mallards may be New Zealand or the less distant Campbell and Auckland Islands.\n\nThe few available records of breeding (eggs, ducklings and nests) for black duck suggest that laying begins in September and extends at least into January.  Zooplankton is most abundant in spring and summer, but ducks may obtain high protein foods from the littoral and sublittoral areas and may also take seeds of terrestrial plants.\n\nAvailable information does not allow separation of habitats used by black duck or mallards.  However, most observations are around coastal areas.  There is some indication that records have increased along the south-western and eastern sides of the Island, but generally there are few observations of either species on the higher, central plateau.\n\nThe intrusion of mallards onto the Island and the resultant hybridisation with black duck poses a threat for the future integrity of the latter native species.\n\nThis dataset contains a review of the data available for Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and grey teal (Anas gibberifrons) and hybrids on Macquarie Island, collected from mid-1949 to January 1985. There is a period of relatively continuous and extensive data between February 1963 and January 1985. Discussion and references about habitat, breeding, feeding and hybrids is provided in the dataset (see the reference), as well as distribution maps.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nYear\n\nMonth\n\nPresence/Absence",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1990 to February 1991. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "<strong>Important notes for interpretation</strong>\n\n<strong>Factors influencing exposure</strong>: High mosquito numbers do not always lead to an increase in human arbovirus cases. Other factors, such as weather, human behaviour, and the use of protective measures, can affect the risk of exposure to mosquito-borne viruses.\n\n<strong>Trapping locations</strong>: Locations on maps reflect the mid-point of sites within a broader location, not exact mosquito trap sites (as some trapping sites are located on private properties).\n\n<strong>Seasonal variation</strong>: Some locations may consistently experience higher mosquito numbers throughout a season while others may have lower numbers and others may have sudden increases in mosquito numbers at points during the season. There may also be variability in mosquito numbers between seasons.\n\n<strong>Positive test results</strong>: For mosquito traps, a detection represents the presence of virus in at least one mosquito in a sample of trapped mosquitoes. For sentinel chickens, a positive test result means that one or more chickens in a flock have tested positive for antibodies directed against a particular virus for the first time, suggesting a newly acquired infection. Infection in chickens gives an indication that there is enough virus to transmit to humans.",

    "description": "###Introduction\r\nTraining.gov.au (TGA) is the National Register of Vocational Education and Training in Australia and contains authoritative information about Registered Training Organisations (RTOs), Nationally Recognised Training (NRT) and the approved scope of each RTO to deliver NRT as required in national and jurisdictional legislation.\r\n\r\n###TGA web-services overview\r\nTGA has a web service available to allow external systems to access and utilise information stored in TGA through an external system. The TGA web service is exposed through a single interface and web service users are assigned a data reader role which will apply to all data stored in the TGA.\r\n\r\nThe web service can be broadly split into three categories:\r\n\r\n1.   RTOs and other organisation types;\r\n\r\n2.   Training components including Accredited courses, Accredited course  Modules Training Packages, Qualifications, Skill Sets and Units of Competency;\r\n\r\n3.   System metadata including static data and statistical classifications.\r\n\r\nUsers will gain access to the TGA web service by first passing a user name and password through to the web server.  The web server will then authenticate the user against the TGA security provider before passing the request to the application that supplies the web services.\r\n\r\nThere are **two web services environments:**\r\n\r\n**1.   Production - ws.training.gov.au** – National Register production web services\r\n\r\n**2.   Sandbox  - ws.sandbox.training.gov.au** – National Register sandbox web services.  \r\n\r\nThe National Register sandbox web service is used to test against the current version of the web services where the functionality will be identical to the current production release.  The web service definition and schema of the National Register sandbox database will also be identical to that of production release at any given point in time.  The National Register sandbox database will be cleared down at regular intervals and realigned with the National Register production environment.\r\n\r\nEach environment has three configured services:\r\n\r\n1.   Organisation Service;\r\n\r\n2.   Training Component Service; and\r\n\r\n3.   Classification Service.\r\n\r\n###Sandbox environment access\r\nTo access the download area for web services, navigate to http://tga.hsd.com.au  and use the below name and password:\r\n\r\n**Username:** WebService.Read (case sensitive)\r\n\r\n**Password:** Asdf098 (case sensitive)\r\n\r\nThis download area contains various versions of the following artefacts that you may find useful\r\n\r\n•   Training.gov.au web service specification document;\r\n\r\n•   Training.gov.au logical data model and definitions document;\r\n\r\n•   .NET web service SDK sample app (with source code);\r\n\r\n•   Java sample client (with source code);\r\n\r\n•   How to setup web service client in VS 2010 video; and\r\n\r\n•   Web services WSDL's and XSD's.\r\n\r\nFor the business areas, the specification/definition documents and the sample application is a good place to start while the IT areas will find the sample source code and the video useful to start developing against the TGA web services.\r\n\r\nThe web services Sandbox end point is: https://ws.sandbox.training.gov.au/Deewr.Tga.Webservices  \r\n\r\n###Production web service access\r\nOnce you are ready to access the production web service, please email the TGA team at *[tgaproject@education.gov.au](mailto:tgaproject@education.gov.au)* to obtain a unique **user name** and **password**.\r\n",

    "description": "The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2014 provides both spatial and text information about government, Indigenous and privately protected areas for continental Australia. State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current to 30 June 2014. The terrestrial component of the database has been previously released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 2010 and 2012.\n\nThis version, provides both spatial and text information about off-shore protected areas in both state and Commonwealth waters.  State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current for 30 June 2014. This is the seventh version of the CAPAD- Marine database, with previous versions published in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008 2010 and 2012. \n\nCAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area:\n\n\"A protected area is an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means\" (IUCN 1994).\n\nThe Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy (DOE) publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad\n\n This version of CAPAD 2014-Marine is a public / downloadable dataset available for use through the CC-BY licencing model. \n\nCommercial users: Commercial users should note the availability of a more descriptive dataset for Commonwealth Marine Reserves. It is recommended for use in commercial applications as it includes additional information about management arrangements for Commonwealth Marine Reserves. This dataset is available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license from:\nhttp://intspat01.ris.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B2E8DD19C-1B93-4D90-BD1C-128DDC4A2998%7D\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR MARINE USERS – TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\nThe process for developing management plans has been completed for the five Commonwealth marine reserve networks declared around Australia and the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve. Until the new management plans come into effect transitional management arrangements are in place. Under these transitional arrangements, there are no changes \"on the water\" for users in the new areas added to the Commonwealth marine reserve estate. If people hold an existing approval to undertake activities within Commonwealth marine reserves or the now-revoked Coral Sea Conservation Zone, they are able to continue to operate under the terms of the existing approval. No additional administrative requirements apply.\n\nThe management plan for the South-east Network came into effect on 1 July 2013 with the management plans for the South-west, North-west, North and Temperate East Networks and the Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve are under review. More information is available at http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-reserves\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMain attributes in the database include:\n\nNAME: the name of the protected area. \n\nTYPE: the type of protected area according to the protected area establishment mechanism. \n\nTYPE_ABBR: the abbreviation of the TYPE.\n\nTYPE abbreviations include:\n\n  AQR = Aquatic Reserve\n  CA = Conservation Area  \n  CMR = Commonwealth Marine Reserve\n  DPAA = Dugong Protection Area (A)\n  DPAB = Dugong Protection Area (B)\n  DS = Dolphin Sanctuary\n  FHAA = Fish Habitat Area (A)\n  FHAB = Fish Habitat Area (B)\n  FHPA = Fish Habitat Protection Area\n  IPA = Indigenous Protected Area\n  LS = Rock Lobster Sanctuary\n  MAR = Marine Reserve\n  MCA = Marine Conservation Area\n  MMA = Marine Management Area\n  MNNR = Marine National Nature Reserve\n  MNP = Marine National Park\n  MNR = Marine Nature Reserve\n  MP = Marine Park\n  MR = Marine Reserve\n  MS = Marine Sanctuary\n  NP = National Park\n  NR = Nature Reserve\n  SH = Shipwreck Reserve\n\n\nIUCN: the IUCN protected area management category ascribed by the Managing authority, as outlined in the publication: CNPPA/WCMC \"Guidelines for Protected Area management categories\". Gland: IUCN, 1994. (ISBN: 2-8317-0201-1).\n\n   Definitions include:\n   IA  Strict Nature Reserve: managed mainly for science;\n   IB  Wilderness Area: managed mainly for wilderness protection;\n   II  National Park: managed mainly for ecosystem protection;\n   III Natural Monument: managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features;\n   IV  Habitat / Species Management Area: managed mainly for conservation through management intervention;\n   V   Protected Landscape / Seascape: managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation;\n   VI  Managed Resource Protected Area: managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems.\n\nGAZ_AREA: area in hectares as described in the nomination document (e.g. parliamentary gazettal), to the nearest hectare.

    "description": "<b>Version 29 January 2020</b>\nThe Rural Residential Lot Sizes Overlay is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "The 3 second (~90m) Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) version 1.0 was derived from resampling the 1 arc second (~30m) gridded DEM (ANZCW0703013355). The DEM represents ground surface topography, and excludes vegetation features. The dataset was derived from the 1 second Digital Surface Model (DSM, ANZCW0703013336) by automatically removing vegetation offsets identified using several vegetation maps and directly from the DSM. The 1 second product provides substantial improvements in the quality and consistency of the data relative to the original SRTM data, but is not free from artefacts. Man-made structures such as urban areas and power line towers have not been treated. The removal of vegetation effects has produced satisfactory results over most of the continent and areas with defects are identified in the quality assessment layers distributed with the data and described in the User Guide (Geoscience Australia and CSIRO Land and Water, 2010). A full description of the methods is in progress (Read et al., in prep, Gallant et al., in prep).

This radar operates at a frequency of 13.912 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz, a maximum range of 100 Km and a range resolution of 1.5 Km.  Azimuthally the radar covers a sweep 60 deg either side of a bore sight direction of 285 deg true east of north (approximately west by north-west).\n\nWithin the HF radar coverage area surface current radials are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied. \n\n\n\nThe Dynamic Land Cover Dataset of Australia is the first nationally consistent and thematically comprehensive land cover reference for Australia.  It is the result of a collaboration between Geoscience Australia and the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences, and provides a base-line for identifying and reporting on change and trends in vegetation cover and extent. Land cover is the observed biophysical cover on the Earth&#xBF;s surface, including native vegetation, soils, exposed rocks and water bodies as well as anthropogenic elements such as plantations, crops and built environments.  Remote sensing data recorded over a period of time allows the observation of land cover dynamics.  Different land cover types display distinct responses due to seasonal, climatic and anthropogenic drivers.  Classifying these responses provides a robust and repeatable way of characterising land cover types.  A key aspect of land cover is vegetation greenness. The greenness of vegetation is directly related to the amount of photosynthesis occurring, and can be measured as an index such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The Dynamic Land Cover Dataset presents land cover information for every 250m by 250m area of the country from April 2000 to April 2008. The classification scheme used to describe land cover categories in the Dynamic Land Cover Dataset conforms to the 2007 International Standards Organisation (ISO) land cover standard (19144-2).  The Dynamic Land Cover Dataset shows Australian land covers clustered into 34 ISO classes. These reflect the structural character of vegetation, ranging from cultivated and managed land covers (crops and pastures) to natural land covers such as closed forest and sparse, open grasslands.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe source data for the Dynamic Land Cover Dataset is a time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites operated by NASA. The time series includes 186 snapshots of vegetation greenness for each 250m by 250m area across the continent over an 8 year period from 2000 to 2008. Complete information on the creation of this product can be found in the following documents available from the Geoscience Australia website www.ga.gov.au/landcover.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nGeoscience Australia (2010) Dynamic Land Cover Dataset.

    "description": "Length and weight measurements for individual fish collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nAbundance and diversity of riverine fish populations are monitored annually at fixed sites within six Selected Areas using a standardised sampling regime involving boat or backpack electrofishing and fine mesh fyke nets (referred to as Category 1 sampling). These methods target large-bodied and small-bodied fish species respectively. A sample of measured individuals (length and weight) were collected for otolith sectioning and age determination to construct age vs size relationships.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Fish length weight.

Armand-1997), and Abbott's (1973) southeast Indian Ocean surface sample data set. \n\nSince each of the data sets were developed over periods of years or were subject to differences in processing and taxonomy, primary analysis was concerned with aligning current taxonomic advances and knowledge against the record of species identified in each data. With exception only to the Abbott southeast Indian Ocean data set (which could no longer be located for verification), the remaining data sets were combined and subjected to taxonomic reform. \n\nFollowing taxonomic reform a core-top diatom database was compiled using sample-selection criteria and through the removal of samples representing unique environmental regimes (i.e. Antarctic Peninsula region). A total of 115 samples from an original 194 remained available for use, and is identified as the Antarctic Diatom Database (ADB).",

    "description": "Three Land Management Zones (LMZs) have been defined within Parks and Wildlife managed land at specified distances from the edge of the populated area. (see Reported Populated Areas data). The depth of these zones is defined by fire behaviour characteristics relevant to the zone purpose. The 200,000 ha prescribed burning target is allocated between the three zones in proportion to the amount of Parks and Wildlife managed land (including UCL) within each zone. Land Management Zone-A • LMZ-A is nearest to populated areas, including Parks and Wildlife managed lands within populated areas. • The objective of management in this zone is to reduce the likelihood of ember attack on populated areas in the event of a bushfire, by maintaining fuel in a condition that will not give rise to extreme fire behaviour. • The depth of LMZ-A is the spotting distance of the average fuels in LMZ-B; meaning that spot fires generated by a fire in LMZ-B will not reach the populated fringe. Land Management Zone-B • The next concentric buffer from the populated interface is LMZ-B. • The objective of management in this zone is to maintain an area within which a high intensity fire run could be arrested before it reaches LMZ-B. • The depth of LMZ-B is equal to the distance travelled by an ‘average’ bushfire in four hours, a period of time considered equivalent to the hottest period of an average day during the fire season. Land Management Zone-C • The third concentric buffer from the populated interface is LMZ-C, comprising the remainder of Parks and Wildlife managed land in the SWBRZ. • The objective of management in this area is to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of large, intense fires in the landscape.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study was to estimate past sea-surface temperature in the Southeast Indian Ocean. The accumulation of diatom microplankton assemblages in sediments being the proxy for these records of climatic change. \n\nA transfer function is a mathematical method that allows quantitative estimations of environmental parameters from past biogenic sedimentation. In this study, a diatom transfer function was established to relate biological species to selected environmental parameter of the ocean (sea-surface temp). These equations were then employed on observed fossil species from core samples to provide quantitative estimates of sea-surface temperature.\n\nEstimates of sea-surface temperature (SST) are given here based on the assemblages of diatoms found in core MD88-787. The information provided gives the extrapolated age-scale through the core, and an estimate of August SST based on a diatom transfer function - DTF 109/24/6.",

    "description": "This dataset contains temperature data from the TOGA/WOCE transect IX9 across the Indian Ocean, between Fremantle and the Persian Gulf. Data have been collected since November 1985 until January 1996. The transect is repeated approximately monthly. Profiles are obtained approximately every 60km (a 1 degree latitude / 1.5 degree longitude grid). \n\nThe data are obtained from XBTs (expendable bathythermographs) deployed via the Ship-of-Opportunity Program (SOOP) of the IOC/WMO Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS), and are now managed by the Joint Australian Facility for Ocean Observing Systems (JAFOOS), a collaborative venture between CSIRO Marine Research and the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC).\n\nExpendable Bathythermographs (XBTs) have been used for many years by oceanographers to measure the temperature of the upper ocean. These instruments are simple devices which are designed to be deployed from moving vessels, enabling broad scale coverage of the world's oceans.",

    "description": "Changes in ocean temperature are of immense importance for global climate studies, marine ecology and fish recruitment, as well as being of interest to recreational swimmers. Because of the Leeuwin Current, water temperatures off Western Australia are some 4°C warmer than those at corresponding latitudes off the west coasts of southern Africa and South America. Water temperature measurements along the Western Australian coast are relatively sparse, although some intensive studies have been undertaken near cities and regional centres, as well as at selected sites important for fisheries. \n\nMonthly temperature statistics have been compiled for a number of sites along the west coast of Australia, using a variety of data sources.

    "description": "EPA Victoria Victorian Landfill Register (VLR) - Location Polygons\nThe Victorian Landfill Register created by EPA in 2018 lists all current and known closed landfills in Victoria and creates a strong foundation for building a complete and comprehensive landfill register for Victorians. Landfills can cause contamination, but once a landfill is closed, operators are obliged to rehabilitate and manage their sites. Even when closed, careful management of sites is required. Many rehabilitated landfills are now safe parks and public spaces, enjoyed by the community.\nThe register draws information from various sources and all sites listed undergo verification before inclusion on the register.\nWhile this public register will make landfill information more available, it should not be used as the only source of information when making important decisions. EPA will continue to build on the register, adding information and improving the service.\nThis dataset mirrors the VLR data available on EPA's website, but may not be up to date due to data transfer processes. For the most up to date information on operating landfill please visit the EPA register of permission.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2007.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

Together, the DEOPE and the Commissioner promote an integrated approach to EEO that recognises the importance of equity and diversity in optimising service design and delivery to the broader community.\r\n\r\nTo assist the DEOPE to monitor the diversity of the workforce, each public authority is required to obtain relevant workforce demographic information from their employees. Local governments, universities, and other entities listed in Schedule 1 of the Public Sector Management Act 1994 (apart from the Western Australian Police Force and Electorate Offices) provide this demographic information through the EEO survey. The Western Australian Police Force and Electorate Offices report workforce data through the human resource minimum obligatory information requirement (HRMOIR) process. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, 138 local governments, four public universities, and 22 other Schedule 1 PSM Act authorities completed the EEO survey. Data for local governments was collected as at March 31 2014, and other authorities as at 30 June 2014.\r\n\r\nThis data set contains a summary of demographics as reported through the EEO survey for each public authority. \r\n\r\nFurther information and aggregate data for each authority type is available in the Director of Equal Opportunity in Public Employment annual report 2014.\r\n",

    "title": "Bauxite of Manus Island, Territory of Papua and New Guinea",
    "description": "Bauxite was found on Manus Island in 1952 by J.E. Thompson, Senior Resident Geologist, Territory of Papua and New Guinea, at three separate localities. At Lepatuan a dacite flow overlies bedded tuffs and both have been bauxitized. The former parent rock yields a porous granular bauxite containing about 1 percent silica, 55 percent alumina, 10-13 percent ferric oxide and 1 percent titania. Bauxite developed on the tuffs is nodular in character, and consists of gibbsite nodules embedded in soft clay-like bauxite. The composition of one sample of this bauxite is 11.7 percent silica, 51.0 percent alumina, 10.8 percent ferric oxide and 1.0 percent titania. The bauxite is forming at the present day by direct alteration of the dacite without an intervening clay zone, but the tuffs are kaolinized in the first stage of alteration. It is of high significance that bauxite can develop on small flat elevated areas (50 acres at Lepatuan) during the present weathering cycle. Essential conditions for bauxitic alteration to take place appear to be - (a) high mean temperature, high rainfall and dense vegetation, (b) relatively flat terrain, and (c) elevation above immediate surroundings to ensure adequate ground-water movement. Total resources of bauxite at Lepatuan are about 600,000 tons, and possible reserves are negligible at the other localities. Difficulties of access and distance from markets militate against commercial exploitation of the deposit, but prospects of finding more bauxite in the islands of the volcanic arcs of Bismark Archipelago cannot be lightly dismissed.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of low birthweight live births, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "Exclusions were attached to artificial substrata to investigate the relative effects of predation on the development of epifaunal communities at Portsea. Exclusions were black plastic mesh cages enclosing panels that were attached to rigs under the Portsea Pier. Bare control panels and cage controls where included in the experimental design. Cage controls had the bottom and half of the roof on the cage removed. There were 2 replicate panels of each treatment that were immersed for 2, 4 or 7 months and there were 6 runs of the experiment from October 1975 to November 1977. At the conclusion of each run of the experiment the panels were fixed in 4% formalin-seawater solution. In the laboratory, the number of individuals and percent cover of colonial species on each panel were recorded. \n\nSurveys identified that grazing fish were the most abundant predator of the epifaunal community at Portsea during the experiment. Predation significantly affected the pattern of establishment of the epifaunal community. There were fewer ascidian recruits and more diverse communities on bare control panels because fish predation prevented monopolisation of space by dominant ascidian competitors. On caged panels were there was no fish grazing, the survival of colonial ascidians was greater and the panels were dominated by arborescent bryozoans and ascidians.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by CSIRO for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation with research and data support by ABARES.  \r\n\r\n The report develops a framework that can be used to assist managers to cost effectively develop target reference points that are consistent with the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy Policy for multispecies in mixed fisheries. The report addresses the problem of determining appropriate target reference points for target and by-product stocks in multispecies fisheries. The applicability of this framework is demonstrated using a case study fishery, the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. \r\n\r\n The report uses generic logistic and exponential bio-economic models to produce a target reference point consistent with the current management framework taking into consideration a wide range of biological and economic conditions. The output was included in the development of a generic decision support framework using two cost effective approaches: regression tree analysis and the Bayesian Network approach. Sensitivity tests were also conducted on all 4 models. The project also develops a separate set of bio-economic models specific to the trawl component of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery examining the static and dynamic aspects of maximum economic yield. \r\n\r\n The results from the generic models suggest that the key determinants of the target reference point of individual species in multispecies mixed fisheries are catchability, growth rates and share of total fishery revenue. Other variables, such as costs of fishing, prices and number of species in the fishery are also influential but to a lesser degree. For the case study fishery, both of the cost effective approaches performed well and achieved better results than the current default proxy target reference point. An incidental result from the study is that attempting to impose a target reference point on all species may not be necessary (or feasible) in multispecies fisheries. Instead, imposing a target on the dominant species (in terms of revenue share) for each sub-fleet results in outcomes close to optimal, and reduces conflicts in catches where target reference points are not perfectly aligned.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of female cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 11 top cancer groupings (breast, cervical, colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, ovary, pancreas, thyroid and uterus) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a GCCSA. The number of people who could not be assigned a GCCSA is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for fish in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches for these HWS scenarios:\n\n<ul><li>Current: habitat suitability for fish under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability for fish under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue. </li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability for fish given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.</li></ul>\n\nResults are presented as:\n\n<ul><li>Stacked probabilities, i.e. habitat suitability all 13 native fished species added together. These stacked probability values were used in the HWS to provide a fish value score each reach and sub-catchments.</li><li>Results are also provided for all 22 fish species. Presentation of habitat suitabilty model results for fish from the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018.</li></ul>\n\n\n\nHabitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs), and 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. \n\n\n\nFurther reading: Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership Melbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "title": "Evidence for a Permian petroleum system in the Timor Sea region, northwestern Australia",
    "description": "Petroleum exploration in the Timor Sea region, Bonaparte Basin, has focussed on plays that are charged and sealed by Mesozoic sediments. However, there is increasing evidence that Palaeozoic oil and gas have contributed to the hydrocarbons found in this area. Geochemical appraisal of the palaeo-oil column at Torrens-1 on the Londonderry High, the gas/condensate reserves in the Petrel and Tern fields in the Petrel Sub-basin, and the gas accumulation at Kelp Deep-1 on the Sahul Platform in the Zone of Co-operation, have revealed that these hydrocarbons are most likely generated from organic-rich Permian sediments.\n\nOil stains and fluid inclusion oil from the Permian Highland Bay and Fossil Head formations at Torrens-1 have similar biomarker compositions indicating a terrestrial source affinity. Carbon isotope values from bulk and compound-specific analyses show that the Fossil Head-reservoired oil is enriched in 13C (13Csat=-26.1 ‰). Despite having lost its lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, the n-alkane isotope profile exhibits a strong negative slope and is similar to the Petrel and Tern condensates reservoired in the Hyland Bay Formation. Onshore in the Petrel Sub-basin, Weaber-4 oil has an isotopic signature enriched in 13C, as observed at Petrel and Tern. These data are distinct from those of the Carboniferous-sourced Barnett/Turtle oils (offshore Petrel Sub-basin) which have  13Csat values in the order of -28 ‰.\n\nDry gas from Kelp Deep-1 in the Hyland Bay Formation has an isotopic composition in keeping with generation from land-plant-rich source rocks, and its stratigraphic and structural position is suggestive of a Permian origin.\n\nPresented at the 2000 AAPG International Conference and Exhibition, Bali",

    "title": "Identification of corridors of river recovery for NSW Northern Rivers catchments",
    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Northern Rivers catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

    "title": "Schools Apparent Retention Rates, Victoria",
    "description": "A dataset of schools apparent retention rates or ARR, all school sector in Victoria, from census year 2012 to 2023.\nThis dataset is prepared and based on data collected from schools as part of the February School Census conducted on the last school day of February each year. It presents information for all government and non-government schools and student enrolments in Victoria, in particular secondary school years. The majority of the statistical data in this publication is drawn from school administration systems. The dataset includes analysis by school sector and sex, Koorie status, as well as on government schools by region.\nApparent retention rates (ARR) are calculated based on aggregate enrolment data and provide an indicative measurement of student engagement in secondary education. The Department of Education and Training (DET) computes and publishes ARR data at a state-wide and DET region level only.\nThe term \"apparent\" retention rate reflects that retention rates are influenced by factors not taken into account by this measure such as: Student repeating year levels, Interstate and overseas migration, Transfer of students between education sectors or schools, Student who have left school previously, returning to continue their school education.\nThe ARR for year 7 to 12 (ARR 7-12) refers to the Year 12 enrolment expressed as a proportion of the Year 7 enrolment five years earlier. The ARR for year 10 to 12 (ARR 10-12) refers to the Year 12 enrolment expressed as a proportion of the Year 10 enrolment two years earlier.\nPlease note that the ABS calculates apparent retention using the number of full-time school students only whereas at the DET we use the number of full-time equivalent school enrolments. Data reported in the ABS Schools, Australia collection is based on enrolment data collected in August by all jurisdictions.\nThe Department has found that computing ARR at geographical areas smaller than DET regions (e.g. LGA, Postcode) can produce erratic and misleading results that are difficult to interpret or make use of. In small populations, relatively small changes in student numbers can create large movements in apparent retention rates. These populations might include smaller jurisdictions, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and subcategories of the non-government affiliation. There are a number of reasons why apparent rates may generate results that differ from actual rates. \nApparent retention rates provide an indicative measure of the number of full-time school students who have stayed in school, as at a designated year and grade of education. It is expressed as a percentage of the respective cohort group that those students would be expected to have come from, assuming an expected rate of progression of one grade per year.\nProvided ARR is a result of calculation of the whole census and is NOT to be re-calculated by average or sum.",

    "description": "A national connectivity index was developed as an instrument for monitoring and prioritising the maintenance and restoration of Australia’s heavily modified landscapes.  Three fundamental ecologically important elements were identified for combination into a single index.  \n\nFor the connectivity context at any location, the amount of remaining natural area, its condition, and spatial separation were assessed.  Because connectivity applies across multiple scales, these measures were made within circular regions ranging from 500 metres to 32 kilometres in diameter.  A single index of connectivity was developed by combining the three indices at all of the spatial scales.\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhile reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis data is licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia for use under a Creative Commons By Attribution 3.0 Australia licence http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\n\nThe data should be cited in publications, products and maps and any other material using this template:\n\nNational Connectivity Index, © Copyright Commonwealth of Australia Department of the Environment and Energy, 2014.\nThis data is licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia for use under a Creative Commons By Attribution 3.0 Australia licence http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\n\nThe data should be cited in publications, products and maps and any other material using this template:\n\nNational Connectivity Index, © Copyright Commonwealth of Australia Department of the Environment and Energy, 2014.",

    "description": "The ISC2010_CHANNEL_TRANSECTS are line features created perpendicular to the river centreline that span the width of ISC2010_BANKFULL_WIDTH polygons. Channel Transects occur every 25m along all reaches. Every fourth Channel Transect coicides with a 100m River Section break. Channel Transects are used to assess and record cross sectional statistics. Channel Transects are represented as two dimensional lines but contain three dimensional cross sectional attributes such as channel area and volume.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",
