This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

There are two exceptions in this dataset. In June 2011, Bass Coast Shire became part of District 8 when the Victorian Government Regional Departmental Boundaries indicated that it should be part of District 9.

The core was located on the Tasman Fracture Zone of the Mid-Ocean Ridge, within the Polar Front Zone.  \n\nSediment samples were taken at 10cm intervals. Isotopic analysis was performed on tests of the planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (200-250um), and revealed that the core covered two climatic cycles. The base of the core was found to represent the end of isotope-stage 7, as was suggested by the last abundant appearance datum (LAAD) of H. karstenii.\n\nThe core contained 195kyr of sedimentation within its 1030cm length. The results also indicate that the Holocene period has the highest rates of sedimentation observed through time. Further variations (excluding isotope-stage 1) appear to indicate that a reduction of the sedimentation rate occurred during the interglacial periods, in contrast to that of the glacials.",

    "title": "Haslams Creek Flood Study",
    "description": "THE STUDY AREA\nHaslams Creek drains a catchment area of about 17km2 in the Auburn Council Local\nGovernment Area. Figure 1 defines the catchment and the major drainage branches\nwhile all the modelled drainage branches are shown in greater detail in Figure 8.\nLand use within the catchment is mostly residential with pockets of industrial and\ncommercial land use while the south-eastern portion of the catchment also includes a\nportion of the Rockwood Cemetery.\nThe main creek is a concrete lined channel upstream of Parramatta Road but has an\nunlined invert and lined banks between Parramatta Road and the M4 Motorway. The\ncreek channel downstream of the M4 Motorway has recently been reconstructed as part\nof the Olympic Village development. This flood study is only concerned with the portion\nof the catchment upstream of the M4 Motorway.\nThe trunk drainage system for the catchment includes various stormwater channels and\npipe networks which discharge into Haslams Creek. The various tributary stormwater\nchannels are all lined. There are numerous structures along the length of the channels,\nmainly road and rail crossings, but there are also some instances of residential and\nindustrial developments spanning the channels.\nThe extent of trunk drainage system analysis was defined in the Study brief (see\nAppendix A) and is also summarised in Table 1. Some parts of the trunk drainage\nsystem, including Haslams Creek, are under the control of Sydney Water while other parts\nof the system are under the control of Auburn Council, as also summarised in Table 1.\nOverbank flooding of the open channel systems and surcharging of the pipe drainage\nsystems have occurred during large rainfall events, such as those occurring in November\n1961, August 1986 and January 1996. Areas of the catchment which have experienced\nproblems in the past include:\n\nVivian Crescent, which is drained by a small capacity pipe, and also experiences\noverland flow from the Railway Culverts Sub-Branch and from Campbell St;\nBachell Street, Delhi Street and between Simla Street and Parramatta Road on the\nArthur Street Branch;\nbetween James Street and East Street on the Joseph Street Branch;\nFrederick Street and Sweet Street (upstream of the Motor Registry) on the Church\nStreet Branch;\nbetween Dartbrook Road and Holliday Lane on the St Hilliers Road Branch; and\nbetween Harrow Road and Dudley Street on the Auburn Heights Branch.\n\nREASONS FOR STUDY\nWhile there has been occasions of overflow of the trunk drainage systems and associated \ninundation of adjoining lands the extent of such inundation may be substantially greater\nduring large storm events. Therefore Council required a study to define such flood\nbehaviour to use as a basis for floodplain management.\nVarious studies to derive design flood levels and discharges for certain parts of the\ncatchment have been undertaken but there were some inconsistencies in the results of\nthese studies. Council therefore commissioned a review of those studies. The resulting\n1996 Bewsher Consulting Review of Haslams Creek Flood Studies report (Reference 1)\nreviewed all of the previous flood studies for Haslams Creek and found that:\n\na large number of flood investigations had been completed within the study area.\nThose studies utilised various hydrologic and hydraulic models, various ground\nsurvey data, various modelling assumptions (e.g. extent of flood storage), various\nassumptions concerning modelling of hydraulic structures, various techniques for\nmodel calibration and verification, various assumptions concerning development\nconditions within the catchment, etc. The geographical coverage of each study was\nalso different in most cases;\ngiven the nature of the Haslams Creek catchment, the models adopted for a flood\nstudy or floodplain management study needed to be able to simulate:\n(1)channel storage and floodplain storage adjacent to the existing channel system,\nespecially upstream of the numerous railway and road crossings;\n(2) affluxes at road and railway structures;\n(3) a mixture of subcritical and supercritical flow, including hydraulic jumps;\n(4) secondary overland flowpaths;\n(5) pipe system capacities, pit losses and flow in pipes with submerged outlets;\nnone of the previous studies had adequately modelled all of these aspects. Most of\nthe previous studies had a limited geographical coverage. Also a number of small\nchanges have occurred in the catchment and the channel systems since the studies\nwere completed.\n\nConsequently, the study recommended that a new flood study be undertaken for the\nbranches upstream of the M4 Motorway.\nThe report included recommendations regarding hydrologic and hydraulic modelling. That\nis, a combination of RAFTS and ILSAX models were deemed suitable for the hydrologic\nmodelling of the open channels and piped systems respectively and a combination of\nMIKE-11 and/or HEC-RAS models were considered suitable for the hydraulic modelling\nof the open channels with hydraulic gradeline analyses of each pipe drainage system.\nThe methodology adopted for this report is consistent with those recommendations and\nis detailed in Section 4.\nIn accordance with Council's study brief (reference Appendix A) this report provides\nestimates of:\n\ndesign discharges for both the open channel and piped drainage systems for 5, 20\nand 100 year average recurrence interval (ARI) and probable maximum flood (PMF)\nevents;\ndesign flood levels, energy levels and velocities along the open channel system for\nthe 5, 20 ~nd 100 year ARI and PMF events;\nhydraulic and hazard categories for areas subject to overbank flooding; and\nthe capacity of the trunk pipe drainage system, the overland flow discharge and the \napproximate depth of overland flow.\n",

    "description": "Summary of species occurrence data from 1900 to 2020 for Australian marine species organised by IMCRA region and status as an introduced or invasive species using the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) list for Australia. Counts are provided by species and IMCRA region for:\n\nThe total number of occurrence records within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period\nThe number of distinct species recorded within the region, for a given GRIIS status and time period  \n\nThe GRIIS list identifies species that are known or believed to have been introduced to Australia. Species that are not included in the GRIIS Australia list are treated here as native species. The GRIIS list also identifies a subset of introduced species as invasive species based on knowledge that these species have had a harmful impact. This dataset organises species occurrences using these GRIIS data to assign species to one of three categories:\n\nNative – not an introduced species\nIntroduced – an introduced species that is not considered invasive\nInvasive – an introduced species that is considered invasive  \n\nThe GRIIS lists have been compiled by experts with knowledge of introduced and invasive species in each country and are still being improved. It should particularly be noted that version 1.6 of the GRIIS Australia list includes a number of species which are native to Australia but which have been translocated to new parts of the country for conservation purposes. In future versions of the GRIIS Australia list, these species will be appropriately identified and can be excluded as required. This is important since the list does not indicate the areas in which the species is considered to have been introduced (including translocated). These species were manually excluded before the dataset was generated, but this version should be treated with caution. Future versions of this dataset will benefit from improvements to the GRIIS Australia list.  \nOccurrence records were aggregated and organised by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/) and include survey and monitoring data collected and managed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/).\nTo find out more about this dataset, visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/summary-data-introduced-species-occurrences-by-marine-ecoregion/\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.26197/ala.91179dd6-d56e-404f-97a7-ea6382307a17",

    "description": "Solitary Islands (Barrett, Jordan, Hayes):  Dives in the Solitary Islands were focused on surveying reef habitats around the Solitary Island Marine Park.  The surveys were conducted as part of a collaboration between the IMOS AUV Facility, the National Environment Research Program (NERP) Theme 1 - National monitoring, evaluation and reporting and NSW DPI Fisheries.  Dives focused on a number of reefs in 20 m to 60 m of water depth and consisted of both dense 25 m x 25 m full photo quadrants designed to allow repeat surveys over years and broader surveys up to 2km in length to document habitat distributions over broader scales.  Additional scientific operations carried out at these sites include multibeam bathymetry, towed video and Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS).",

Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Brisbane City SA2 by AURIN.",

    "title": "Final report: National Marine Sediments Database and Seafloor Characteristics  Project",
    "description": "The National Marine Sediments Database and Seafloor Characteristics project is a collaborative effort between the National Oceans Office and Geoscience Australia. The aims of the project included identification and collation of existing marine sediment data within the Australian Marine Jurisdiction, development and population of the MARS sediments database and mapping and analysis of sediment data for the Northern Planning Area and the Australian region to provide information for the National Benthic Marine Bioregionalisation. \nThe creation of the MARS database marks the transition to a new era of easy internet access to quantitative seafloor information. This is the first project to critically assess the quality and coverage of Australia's seafloor sediment data on a national scale. The initial phase of the project was the identification and collation of sediment data. At the completion of this phase, the MARS database contained about 25,000 samples for which 138,000 properties had been recorded. \nMaps of sediment properties were produced using validated quantitative data for two regions: the Northern Planning Area (NPA) and the whole of the Australian Marine Jurisdiction, excluding external territories. These maps show the distribution of measured grain size data (weight percent gravel, sand and mud), calculated mean grain size, as well as sediment classification based on the Folk scheme (Folk, 1954), and carbonate content. Mean grain size data for six of the marine domains were used to model sediment mobility in waters less than 300 m depth, using Geoscience Australia's GEOMAT package. The results of the modelling were produced as maps of tide and wave exceedance, and an energy regime regionalisation. \nAs a direct result of this project, the MARS database is now an important scientific and educational resource for those requiring detailed information on seafloor sediment characteristics within the Australian Marine Domain areas. The maps generated by this project show the level of detail and type of presentation possible when using quantitative data, but significant gaps in measured data coverage were also identified. Some 70% of the total marine domain remains unmapped in terms of measured sediment data. Much of this area is off the continental shelf, although gaps in the data coverage on the shelf are significant, particularly in the South-west and West-central Marine Domains\nStrategic directions for improving the data coverage include the analysis of existing sediment samples from Australian and overseas repositories. A valuable resource of seabed samples stored in Australia and overseas has been identified. These samples, if analysed, have the potential to double the existing overall measured data coverage for Australia's Marine Domains and would provide a cost-effective way of generating new data. The South-west Marine Domain would provide a useful pilot study to test the utility of analysing existing material.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2009 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Land capability for annual horticulture in the south west of Western Australia based on analysis and interpretation of the best available soil-landscape mapping dataset (DPIRD-027).\n\nLand capability refers to the ability of land to support a type of land use without causing damage. See DAFWA Resource Management Technical Report 298 for a description of the qualities assessed and the methodology involved.\n\nThe assessment for annual horticulture covers the production of irrigated horticultural crops from plants with short-term life cycles (typically completed within the period of a year). Crops include annual fruits (strawberries, melons, etc.), vegetables (e.g. potatoes, lettuce, cabbages, tomatoes, pumpkins, etc.), commercial turf production and cut flowers. \n\nThe assumptions for the land use as assessed include: \n• crops are grown for commercial production \n• crops are shallow-rooted with most roots using only the top 50 cm of soil \n• crops are irrigated using sprinkler or trickle systems \n• mechanised cultivation occurs at least annually \n• fertilisers and herbicides, fungicides and/or pesticides are broadcast at least annually \n• crop rotation is practised \n• considers physical requirements only and ignores socio-economic factors. \n\nCapability ratings do not take into account factors such as the availability and quality of water supplies for irrigation or climatic risks such as frost or heat stress. Such factors need to be considered as a separate layer of information.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for Plant Health Australia  \r\n Overview  \r\n Experience from overseas indicates that the cost of an incursion by black-striped mussel is likely to be large without management. This report presents a comparison of the estimated costs associated with the alternative responses to an incursion: eradication and containment. Hypothetical incursions of black-striped mussel in ten case study areas across four Australian ports were considered. The cost of eradicating the initial mussel incursion from a case study area is compared to the cost of containing the mussel population to the port encompassing the case study area. The findings indicate that eradication is in most cases the preferred and less costly option over a range of time scales with the caveat that the likelihood of successful eradication will depend on early detection and response. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n•  Mytilopsis sallei  (black-striped mussel) is an invasive marine species that has been translocated from its native range in the Caribbean to a large number of ports in southern and eastern Asia. \r\n• An incursion of black-striped mussel in Darwin in 1999 was successfully eradicated at a cost of in excess of $3.2 million in 2012 terms. This species has been reported to have become established in a number of overseas trading ports, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai. The risks of translocation to Australia have therefore increased in recent years. \r\n• If an incursion by this species is not managed, it has the potential to cause significant and widespread economic and environmental damage. \r\n• A comparison of the costs associated with eradication with those of containment and control in a range of scenarios found that in many cases eradication is the preferred option, but containment and control may be preferred in some situations. \r\n",

    "description": "CSIRO Protected Area Representativeness Index (PARC: Representativeness) is a global 30 arc-second product for 1970,1980,1990,2000,2005,2010,2015, 2020, and 2024. The Protected Area Representativeness and Connectedness (PARC) indices measure the extent to which terrestrial protected areas, and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), are ecologically representative, and well-connected (both to one another, and to other areas of intact natural ecosystems in the surrounding landscape). For the purposes of reporting against the 2010-2020 Aichi Targets, the PARC was originally configured as two separate indicators: the Protected Area Representativeness Index (or ‘PARC-representativeness’) and the Protected Area Connectedness Index (or ‘PARC-connectedness’). However, these two indices were always designed in a manner which would allow them to be logically combined to yield a composite indicator of the extent to which a system of protected areas and OECMs is both ecologically representative and well-connected.  \n\nThe PARC indices, whether generated separately or as a composite, are used to monitor and report past-to-present trends in representativeness and connectedness by repeated calculation using best-available mapping of protected areas and OECMs at multiple points in time, e.g. for different years. They can also provide a foundation for assessing the contribution that potential additions to the system of protected areas and OECMs might make to improving present PARC scores, thereby providing a foundation for prioritising such actions.      \n\nThe PARC indices time series from 1970-2020 can be viewed on the UN Biodiversity Lab web map via the link in the Related Links section below.

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 11 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a subset of the Sedimentary Basins dataset developed by Geoscience Australia. It represents those sedimentary basins in the South-west commonwealth marine planning region that are considered to be prospective for petroleum, and it has been attributed with a rating describing the relative prospectivity of different areas. This interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity is derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins. The classification terms used represent a simplified qualitative assessment of petroleum prospectivity, and are subject to future change as new data are gathered and interpreted.\n\nThe information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the South-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe Sedimentary Basins dataset itself provides outlines for the maximum extent of Australian geological provinces and their components, including sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic provinces, both onshore and offshore.  These data were compiled as part of Geoscience Australia's integrated digital information system to provide improved accessibility and knowledge relating to the petroleum and minerals geology and prospectivity, and to provide a national stratigraphic and tectonic framework for Australia.  The current Sedimentary Basins dataset is not complete for Australia, and covers only offshore sedimentary provinces and a selection of sedimentary and igneous provinces in onshore eastern Australia.The information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the South-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe following caveat applies to the use of the data in any mapping products:\n'The interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity are derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins.

Standard patents are granted only for inventions - in other words an invention that is not an obvious thing to do for someone with knowledge and experience in the technological field of the invention. The innovation patent is granted for an incremental advance on existing technology or knowledge that makes a substantial contribution to the working of the invention.\n\n\n\n\n To derive the figure for per 100,000 residents, the total number of patents granted annually to individuals and entities living or working in the municipality is divided by the municipality's population divided by 100,000. The result is a figures expressed as the number of new patents granted per 100,000 population.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Program from sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. A landscape classification approach was used to determine how hydrological changes due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development may affect ecosystems at a landscape scale in the Isa GBA region. Nine landscape classes have been identified for the Isa GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nInputs into the landscape classification were based on existing classification schemes wherever possible and can be purely physical, biological or predictive. Choice of approach depends on the availability of data at an appropriate scale, as well as the expertise and resources for undertaking the assessment. Landscape classifications should be credible, transparent, logical and consistently applied; where possible, match other classifications (or at least some of their classes); and be feasible within available resourcing. The landscape classification developed for the Isa GBA region is based on Queensland Land Zones (Wilson and Taylor, 2012), which were supplied by the Queensland Government (State of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science), 2018) and assigned to corresponding landscape classes.\r\n\r\nState of Queensland (Department of Environment and Science) (2018) Biodiversity status pre-clear reg ecosys QLD 2018/03/01.

    "title": "Victorian Alpine Resorts - Daily Snow Depth Records Mount Baw Baw",
    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

A short sea trial voyage (October 22 - 25, Hobart - Hobart) was undertaken prior to the charter. Data for those days is also included in this data set.\nThe Kongsberg EM122 multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry,  backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter.\nThe EM122 provides a 1 degree by 1 degree angular resolution. The echosounder's nominal frequency is 12 kHz.\nData are stored in .all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .wcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 1658 files totalling 58.5 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nTide corrections were not applied to the processed data. Processed data had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request.",

    "description": "Figures for ‘RBA foreign exchange transactions’, ‘Change in reserve assets due to valuation’ and ‘Total change in reserve assets’ refer to period totals. All other figures are end period values.\r\n\r\n‘RBA foreign exchange transactions’, sales (-) and purchases (+), are reported according to the date on which settlement takes place (‘value date’).\r\n\r\n‘Market’ transactions are foreign exchange transactions against the Australian dollar (excluding foreign exchange swaps) undertaken by the RBA with authorised foreign exchange dealers in Australia or banks overseas.\r\n\r\n‘Australian Government’ transactions are the RBA’s foreign exchange transactions with the Australian Government.\r\n\r\n‘Other outright’ transactions include the RBA’s outright transactions with other central banks, international financial institutions which are not intended to affect the exchange rate, clients other than the Australian Government, and interest received on holdings of foreign assets.\r\n\r\n‘Swap deliveries’ are RBA foreign exchange swap transactions that settled during the period, excluding swaps conducted with the Federal Reserve as part of the USD Swap Facility. For the period January 1995 until February 1996 ‘Other outright’ includes ‘Swap deliveries’.\r\n\r\n‘Official reserve assets’ comprise holdings of ‘Foreign exchange’, ‘Gold’ and ‘Other’ reserve assets, which comprise Special Drawing Rights, Reserve position in the IMF and the net value of swap transactions conducted with the Federal Reserve as part of the USD Swap Facility.\r\n\r\n‘Outstanding forward foreign exchange commitments’ mainly reflect market values of the second leg of RBA swap transactions outstanding and, from time to time, outstanding RBA outright forward transactions. Prior to July 2002 contract values are reported.\r\n\r\nThe sum of ‘Gold’ and ‘Foreign exchange’ may differ from figures reported in the weekly Statement of Liabilities and Assets and the RBA’s Annual Report. From 1 July 1996, foreign currency securities sold under repurchase agreements are retained for accounting purposes as foreign currency investments in the RBA’s balance sheet, in accordance with standard accounting treatment. For the purpose of reporting foreign exchange reserves in this table, however, securities sold under repurchase agreements are excluded. In addition, from 20 December 2006, foreign exchange sales (-) and purchases (+) are reported for accounting purposes according to the date on which they are contracted (‘trade date’). For the purpose of reporting foreign exchange reserves in this table, however, foreign exchange transactions are reported according to the date on which settlement takes place (‘value date’).\r\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes:\n    Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries\nas well as on a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports) gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web page to access these reports and for further information: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the forestry node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment; the only commodity in this node is Radiata pine. Maps are provided for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination contained in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations.",

Sensor devices are typically installed on a street pole and locations are selected based on relevant project criteria.\n\nSince the beginning of the Microclimate Sensor Readings dataset in 2019, some sensor devices have been relocated. This may be for various reasons such as construction works or re-assignment to new climate projects. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical data.\n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with related dataset (linked below). Site_id refers to the location of the unique sensor device which may have changed over time. \n\nRelated datasets:\nMicroclimate Sensor - Sensor Readings",

    "description": "A tide gauge mooring was installed in 10-12m of water 200m off the west coast of Bowen Island, Jervis Bay. Opposed to other moorings in the area, this particular mooring did not house additional current meters. \n\nOver a period of approx. 9 months the mooring was deployed 4 times in the same location (as illustrated). \nDeployments 1-4  -35.1183 S 150.763 E. \nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1) 22/6/89 - 13/7/89... 2) 28/8/89 - 13/11/89... 3) 13/11/89 - 29/1/90... 4) 29/1/90 - 28/3/90.\n\nDatasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the tide gauge over the study period.\nThe Aanderaa WLR5 tide gauges used in this study average over 41 seconds for all sampling intervals. In the case of the 2nd and 3rd deployment the sampling interval was 15mins, while for the 4th deployment a sampling interval of 30mins was used. Unfortunately no data is available from the 1st deployment. \n\nThe tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~10m in all deployments. In addition to depth, the tide gauge also housed a temperature sensor.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2011 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "title": "IMOS - ACORN - Coffs Harbour HF ocean radar site (New South Wales, Australia)",
    "description": "The Coffs Harbour (COF) HF ocean radar site is located near the point at which the East Australian Current (EAC) begins to separate from the coast.  Here the EAC is at its narrowest and swiftest: to the north it is forming from the westwards subtropical jet, and to the south it forms eddies and eventually the warm water moves eastwards across the Tasman Sea, forming a front with the cold water of the Southern Ocean.  \n\nThe connection between coastal and continental shelf waters is fundamental to the understanding of the anthropogenic impact on the coastal ocean and the role of the ocean in mitigating urban marine water quality. The oceans off Eastern Australia and in particular in the region of New South Wales have a complex circulation structure, and are strongly connected with other regional seas and currents. \n\nThe East Australia Current (EAC) flows from tropical regions southward along the NSW continental slope, bringing tropical biota southward. These current structures provide strong physical and biological connectivity, allowing substantial transport and dispersion of biota between regions, and influencing the transport and upwelling of nutrients, which are fundamental to biological productivity.  \n\nThe COF HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Red Rock (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) to the north of Coffs Harbour and North Nambucca (-24.111 S, 152.713 E) to the south.  The area of focus is off Coffs Harbour where IMOS and the NSW government have mooring sites.  These radars operate at a frequency of 13.920 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz and a maximum range of 100 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC14) was collected from a depth of 2004 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~80cm into the core. Two samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; from the sediment surface (GC14-0) representing interglacial sediment, while the second sample, from 80cm (GC14-80) represents glacial sediment. XRD analysis of these samples show a slight increase in carbonate percentage during the interglacial compared to the glacial, with increased clay and quartz during the glacial. During the interglacial there are minor amounts of Mg calcite, which suggests that there is little influence from the reef platform on the sediments during the present sea-level, or that the core is presently below the Mg calcite compensation depth.",

    "title": "River Risk Ratings",
    "description": "The River Risk Ratings provide a comprehensive view of how river condition and risk have been assessed across New South Wales over the past three decades. This collection brings together historic and contemporary datasets developed from the 1990s to the present, illustrating the evolution of assessment methodologies used to understand river health, hydrological stress, and ecological vulnerability. Together, these datasets link spatial layers, tabular data, and supporting reports — forming a single point of truth for understanding how NSW river systems have been evaluated through time. \n\nThe River Risk Ratings are comprised of three key components, each reflecting a distinct period and methodology in river risk assessment: \n\n<strong>1. River Risk Ratings – Historic Stress Rivers Assessment (1990s)</strong>\n\nA historic dataset derived from the original Stress Rivers Approach (SRA) developed during the 1990s, prior to the introduction of the Water Management Act 2000. This early method classified rivers according to stress indicators such as water extraction pressure and ecological condition. It represents one of the first systematic attempts to quantify river stress across NSW and serves as an important baseline for later risk assessments. \n\n<strong>2. River Risk Ratings – Historic Macro Risk Assessment (2000s)</strong>  <em>yet to publish</em> \n\nA historic risk dataset developed during the 2000s by water planners. This macro-level assessment expanded on the earlier SRA work by incorporating hydrological and ecological metrics to evaluate risk at the catchment scale. It informed early water-sharing and planning frameworks under the emerging Water Management Act 2000 and provides continuity between the early and modern risk assessment models. \n\n<strong>3. River Risk Ratings – Contemporary Risk Assessment (2016–Present)</strong> <em>yet to publish</em> \n\nThe current and ongoing statewide river risk dataset developed from 2016 to the present. It consolidates a decade of river risk ratings into a centralised database, supported by spatial layers and associated reports (including those linked to the MDBA Water Resource Plans). This represents the most up-to-date and standardised approach to river risk assessment in NSW and forms the operational basis for future updates. \n\n\n\n<strong>How to Access the Data on the SEED Open Data Portal</strong>\nThis landing page provides an overview only. To view or download the data, perform the following:\n<ol>\n<li>Scroll down and click “Related Datasets” (Dataset relationship).</li>\n<li>Select one of the listed datasets.</li>\n<li>On that dataset’s page, the data will either be available in the <strong>Dataset Packages</strong> section (if files are attached) or in the <strong>External Links</strong> section (if the dataset redirects you to another site to view or download the data).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

    "description": "This classification of aquatic ecosystems was developed for the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office, Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Australia, and Murray-Darling Basin Authority to support the management of environmental water in the Murray-Darling basin.\nAn interim application of the Australian National Aquatic Ecosystem (ANAE) classification framework has been applied to all floodplain polygons. The associated data table contains the ANAE floodplain attributes and resulting typology. \n\nThis dataset is a merged product of three sources: Floodplain_MDBAv2_ANAE, Floodplain_SA_ANAE and Floodplain_RERP_ANAE.\n\nRERP_ANAE results from the merger of three separate 2009-2010 NSW Rivers Environmental Restoration Program (RERP) mapping layers for the Lowbidgee, Macquarie Marshes, and Gwydir wetlands. ANAE floodplain attributes and typology are assigned in the data table.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nLicenced for use under Creative Commons Australia Attribution. We request attribution as (c) Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Energy.\nVictoria\nVictoria maintains an inventory of wetlands (WETLAND_CURRENT) which is designed for use in Victorian wetland projects and is subject to ongoing validation and updates. WETLAND_CURRENT can be obtained from the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (see http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/forestry-and-land-use/maps-imagery-and-data\nfor further details). For lacustrine and palustrine aquatic ecosystems, the MDB_ANAE geodatabase is more suited to wetland projects involving other jurisdictions. While much of the data for lacustrine and palustrine wetlands was sourced from WETLAND_CURRENT, there may be some inconsistencies between MDB_ANAE geodatabase and WETLAND_CURRENT. The two datasets can be linked through the AltSrcID (MDB_ANAE geodatabase) and Wetland_No (WETLAND_CURRENT data set) fields.\nSA\nDue to the Basin-wide nature of this dataset, accuracy of final classes has not been ground truthed comprehensively, which could impact results of any analysis using this data. Therefore it is imperative that this dataset is assessed as to fitness for use in any application and decisions made about further levels of validation required. Significant care should be taken if information derived from this dataset is to guide decision making, form binding agreements regarding target setting, compliance of any form, or monitoring of achievements, this includes for the purpose of summarising areas of wetland types.

    "description": "We propose a modest program to continue monitoring 4 of the 6 known radio magnetars in order to achieve three primary science goals. The first is to characterise magnetar outbursts over long timescales, for which tracking their rotational, flux density, and polarisation properties provide a clear view of the impulse response of their magnetic fields. Second, understanding the links between magnetars the mysterious fast radio burst phenomenon through the discovery of rare emission and propagation effects, shared spectro-temporal phenomenology, and connections to high-energy (X-ray/gamma-ray) phenomena. Lastly, our continued monitoring has enormous benefit to the wider magnetar community, providing rapid alerts to changes in activity, adding context to unusual behaviour detected by high-enery observations, and a host of supplementary science through the teams extensive collaborative networks. The project and its precursors have been running since 2007 and have contributed to 21 publications since then. We are seeking to convert the project to long-term status, thereby also carrying these investigations into the SKA era.",

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2014 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2014 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2013 – 30 June 2014, for others it will be the 2014 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nAs at November 2016, approximately 46 000 registered charities have submitted their 2014 AIS to the ACNC. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2014 reporting period. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS asked information about charity finances for the first time. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greated detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

    "description": "The WACHEM database is a compilation of multi-element geochemistry of rocks unconsolidated surface material (regolith) and drill core collected by the Geological Survey of Western Australia. Samples have been analysed for a range of major element oxides, trace elements, rare earth elements (REE), and isotopes by a variety of analytical approaches at commercial, government and university laboratories. In most cases, analysis of unknowns has been carried out along with samples of know composition (reference materials), a second sample of the unknown (sample duplicate), and material which does not contain detectable amounts of elements of interest (blank). These data are included with analysis of unknowns, and these quality control data can be used to gauge the quality of analysis. For inclusion in the geochemical database, analytical data for each element in each sample must include the unit of measurement, lower level of detection (LLD) of that element, and an indication of the analytical technique (usually specified as a laboratory-specific code). To minimise the inclusion of spurious data in the database, analytical batch data are loaded with reference to a set of look up tables, against which data can be checked for consistency. ",

This report for the 2018–19 monitoring period  is the first change report for a series of SLATS reporting which monitors and accounts for woody vegetation extent and change in Queensland, annually. The monitoring period is nominally from August 2018 to August 2019. The methodology monitors and reports change in woody vegetation extent against a 2018 woody vegetation extent baseline. Included in the data are information about the clearing activity type and estimates of woody vegetation density and age, to better describe what woody vegetation currently exists, and where and how it is being cleared. Regrowth reporting is not included in the 2018-19 data, as regrowth generally occurs on time scales greater than one year and existing regrowth in 2018–19 period has been mapped and characterised in the 2018 woody vegetation extent baseline.

The Territory Plan is the key statutory planning document in the ACT, providing the policy framework for the administration of planning in the ACT. It is changed from time to time due to social, economic and environmental reasons. The Territory Plan is used to manage development, in particular the way in which land is used and what can be built. It is used in assessment of development applications and to guide the development of new estate areas (future urban land).",

These surfaces and can be accessed using most 3D-software packages.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nOrr et al. (2020) published regional three-dimensional depth and isochore maps for key stratigraphic horizons of the Beetaloo Sub-basin and overlying Paleozoic (Georgina/Wise/Daly) and Mesozoic (Carpentaria) basins. These maps are based on: published depth maps of Frogtech Geoscience (2018a; 2018b), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NT) (2018a; 2018b), Randal (1973), Hutchinson et al. (2008); seismic interpretation of Williams (2019), and; additional modelled surfaces based on formation top picks contained in well completion reports (Northern Territory Government, 2018).

    "description": "Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) is the percentage of ground area occupied by the vertical projection of foliage. The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on an automated decision tree classification technique applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM  and Landsat-8 OLI imagery for the period 1988-2013. The wooded extent product has a nominal accuracy of 85%. The field data used to calibrate the imagery/FPC relationship was mostly collected over the period 1996-1999. Corrections have been applied to remove errors due to topographic effects, cloud, cloud shadow, water, cropping, and regrowth following clearing. Some errors may remain. The product was generated from WRS-2 path/row scenes obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). While some land cover change may be detected in the FPC processing, this product is not designed to generate clearing or regrowth following clearing layers, and should not be used to assess clearing or be compared with previous years for change monitoring. The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) produces accurate clearing layers for this purpose.",

    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe first of these six experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay during the summer months, when the waters are normally thermally stratified. This experiment consisted of 8 current meters in 3 moorings within the bay, along with pressure gauges to measure water levels and a meteorological station measuring winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head. The moorings were maintained for a single deployment from 6th December 1988 to 11th January 1989. [Given that this meteorological data bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.]\n\nThe black, yellow and orange moorings held tidal gauges, while the red, blue and green moorings held current meters at various depths. The red mooring held current meters at ~6.5m, 10.5m, 14.5m and 18.5m, while the blue mooring held meters at ~5.5m and 11.5m and the green mooring at ~5.5m and 9.5m.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.  There are four subsidiary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n30915440-c321-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\nc5340590-c3b5-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\na4d79ad0-c3c1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\n08d650b0-c3f1-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8",

It includes a shapefile of point locations for the chosen wells and is attributed with the drill hole data relating to latitude, longitude, licencee, operator, depth, dates, reports etc., with a formatted Site_ID field added. The formatted site ID comes from the database table included in the dataset and has been formatted to produce a fixed width (6 digit) number from integer values (e.g. 32 = 000032)\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nBuilding of a 3D geological model with stratigraphy and lithology.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis resource was created from information on the depth, lithology and stratigraphy of well data located within the Hunter Deep Well Completion Reports (GUID: f2df86d5-6749-48c7-a445-d60067109f08) and South Sydney Deep Well Completion Reports (GUID: dbeba812-8f42-4377-a178-608deaf82811). Wells with relevant lithogical data within the Hunter subregion and the adjacent areas within the South Sydney Basin were selected to define the depth and thickness of geological layers within the model. A shapefile of point locations for the chosen wells was created and attributed with the drill hole data relating to latitude, longitude, licencee, operator, depth, dates, reports etc., with a formatted Site_ID field added. The formatted site ID comes from the database table included in the dataset and has been formatted in excel to produce a fixed width (6 digit) number from integer values (e.g. 32 = 000032).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) HUN Geological Model Inputs CSIRO 2014 to 2015 v01.

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 6 top cancer groupings (colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin and pancreas) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a PHN. The number of people who could not be assigned a PHN is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "The operational map for Tablelands Snow Gum, Black Sallee, Candlebark and Ribbon Gum Grassy Woodland (Tableland Snow Gum or TSG) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. The determination of TSG was reviewed by the project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel), and a set of diagnostic parameters for identifying the TSG TEC was agreed upon. These parameters included the bioregions in which TSG is likely to be located in, landscape features such as elevation and geology, and quantitative floristic attributes from vegetation communities explicitly listed in the determination.\nUsing these diagnostic parameters, we defined the study area as being all IBRA subregions that cover the 600-1400m elevation range within the South Eastern Highlands, Sydney Basin, South East Corner and Australian Alps bioregions. We then compiled floristic plot data for all State Forest areas within our study area. Floristic plot data was sourced from both existing flora surveys held in the OEH VIS database and from targeted flora surveys conducted specifically for this project. We compared these plots with those previously assigned to flora communities listed in the determination of TSG. Both dissimilarity-based methods and multivariate regression methods were used for the comparison. The results of the comparison were then used to assess the likelihood that the plots in State forests belonged to one or more of the communities listed in the TSG determination.\nWe also conducted presence-absence predictive distribution modelling to identify potential distributions of each of the primary vegetation communities cited in the determination for TSG. The modelling predicted the likelihood of occurrence for each community across State Forests in the study area based on a modelled relationship with environmental and remotely sensed variables. As such, the modelling assisted in identifying un-surveyed areas of potential TSG habitat and guiding follow-up survey efforts and aerial photography interpretation (API) work.\nAPI assessment was carried out for all State Forests where the predictive modelling identified areas with high probability-of-occurrence values. We used recent high resolution stereo digital imagery in a digital 3D GIS environment to delineate areas of potential TSG based on observable patterns in canopy species dominance, understorey characteristics and landform elements. \nWe constructed the operational map by assigning our API polygons as being TSG based on the extent to which the floristic plots within or near to each API polygon belonged to TSG. We used a precautionary approach and assessed a mapped polygon as TSG if the map unit to which it belonged contained any TSG plot. \nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "description": "<b>This spreadsheet replicates selected data tables from the ACT &amp; Queanbeyan Household Travel Survey dashboard.</b>\nPlease refer to the attached spreadsheet on this page.\n\n<b>About the Active Travel theme</b>\nActive travel relates to any trips made by <b>walking or cycling</b>.\n\nWhile active transport is often used to describe the combined benefits of walking and cycling, the willingness and opportunity to use either mode will naturally differ depending on the person and their travel context. \n\nAs expected, this theme highlights that there is a much higher proportion of walk trips compared to bicycle. Closer examination of the data also reveals socio-demographic variability in active travel choices. For example, two-thirds of cycling trips are made by males. \n\nAs well as trip counts, data is also summarised by trip percentages. This can be the mode share for each analysis group (e.g., holding each cohort constant, such as 'all females', and examining their use of walking compared to cycling) <b>or</b> the use of each mode across groups (e.g., holding mode constant, such as 'all walk trips', and examining the distribution of these across males and females). Both summaries are provided on separate tabs.\n\nNote that the tables provided represent a small subset of data available. Use of the dashboard or raw survey datasets allow more complex descriptions of travel to be developed.\n\n<b>Source data</b>\nThe data shown is not a Census of travel, but a large survey of several thousand households from across the ACT and Queanbeyan. As with any survey there will be some variability in the accuracy of the results, and how well they reflect the movement of the entire population. For instance, if the survey were to be completed on another day, or with a different subset of households, the results would be slightly different. \nInterpretations of the data should keep this variability in mind: these are estimates of the broad shape of travel only. Even for the same person, travel behaviour will vary according to many factors: day of week, month of year, season, weather, school holidays, illness, family responsibilities, work from home opportunities, etc. Again, by summarising the travel of many different people, the data provides a view of average weekday patterns.\n\nIn interpreting the data, it is worth noting the following points:\n-    A zero cell does not necessarily mean the travel is never made, but rather that the survey participants did not make this travel on their particular survey day.\n-    Values are rounded, and may not sum to the totals shown.\nTrip time periods are assigned using the mid point of travel:\n-   AM peak (8am to 9am), PM peak (5pm to 6pm), Interpeak (9am to 5pm), Off-peak (after 6pm)\n\nThe small sample size (approximately 1 per cent) of people who either did not report their gender, or who did not identify as male or female, prevented their analysis as a distinct cohort group. Responses from these participants have been randomly allocated to the male and female groups.\n\nHousehold income quartiles are derived by a summation of individual income ranges. As no adjustment has been made for household size, single person households are over-represented in the lowest income quartile.\nAn employment status of 'Not in workforce' is only applied to children. Retired people will be classed as 'Not employed'.\n\nThe survey is described on the Transport Canberra and City Services' website:\n<a href=\"https://www.transport.act.gov.au/planning-for-the-future/household-travel-survey\">[Household Travel Survey homepage]</a>\n\n<b>Cell annotations and notes</b>\nSome cells have annotations added to them, as follows:\n*    : Statistically significant difference across survey years (at the 95% confidence level). Confidence intervals indicate where the true measure would typically fall if the survey were repeated multiple times (i.e., 95 times out of 100), recognising that each survey iteration may produce slightly different outcomes.\n~    : Un",

    "description": "Ice thickness measurements were made in 1961 by seismic methods on a line southward from S-2, a glaciological station 50 miles east-south-east of Wilkes Base, Antarctica. The traverse constituted the first year's work of a three-year programme. The results showed that the rock underlying the ice dips below sea level at a point between 20 and 40 miles south of S-2. It remains below sea level at all the locations occupied to the south, as far as 280 miles south of S-2, where the rock surface is again above sea level. The main feature is a valley disclosed in the rock formation between 40 and 80 miles south of S-2. Midway between these two points the rock lies at approximately 7500 ft below sea level. The positions of the Totten Glacier and the John Quincy Adams Glacier suggest that the valley may have been responsible for their formation.",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe maps represent a compilation of dryland salinity risk and hazard mapping\r\nfor 2000, 2020 and 2050. The map shows the broad distribution of areas\r\nconsidered as having either a high salinity risk or a high salinity hazard. In\r\nsouthern Australia where groundwater level and trend data are available,\r\nassessments that are more confident have been possible. However, in northern\r\nAustralia groundwater data for trend analysis are very sparse or non-existent.\r\nIn these regions, salinity assessments have been based on the presence of\r\ngeological, landscape, regolith, land use and climate attributes which are the\r\nprime drivers of salinity. This national map provides a basis for identifying\r\nthose regions where more detailed assessments are warranted, and where land\r\nuse changes should be targeted if the risks are to be managed.The bulk of non-\r\nagricultural areas in Western Australia, South Australia and western New South\r\nWales were considered to have a very low salinity risk and were not\r\nassessed.Please note that the Commonwealth and all suppliers of source data\r\nused to derive the maps of aAustralia, Forecast Areas Containing Land of High\r\nHazard or Risk of Dryland Salinity from 2000 to 2050a3 do not warrant the\r\naccuracy or completedness of information in this product. Any person using or\r\nrelying upon such information does so on the basis that the Commonwealth and\r\ndata suppliers shall bear no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any\r\nerrors, faults, defects or omissions in the information.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r9nn\r\nd_00211a00.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "#Updated September 2021 to include land use tiles. These tiles address issues with analysis of the large single dataset.#\r\n\r\nThis vector dataset is a compilation of land use data for Western Australia, as at August 2018. It has been derived from various vector datasets with attribution relevant to land use in Western Australia. The date of mapping (2008 to 2018) and scale of mapping (1:5 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. \r\n\r\nThe data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager. As a seamless spatial dataset for Western Australia, it can be used to identify, map and analyse high level land use categories (such as nature conservation, dryland cropping and irrigated horticulture) and more specific land use categories (such as aquaculture and tree fruits) including some commodities (such as bananas). These categories can be extracted or combined with other spatial datasets to provide new insights and analysis concerning land use in Western Australia. \r\n\r\nLand use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 8, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. The primary, secondary and tertiary codes work together to provide increasing levels of detail about the land use. Land may be subject to a number of concurrent land uses. For example, while the main management objective of a multiple-use production forest may be timber production, it may also provide conservation, recreation, grazing and water catchment land uses. In these cases, production forestry is commonly identified in the ALUM code as the prime land use. \r\n\r\nThe operational scales of the mapping vary according to the intensity of land use activities and landscape context. Scales range from 1:5 000 and 1:25 000 for irrigated and peri-urban areas, to 1:100 000 for broadacre cropping regions and 1:250 000 for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone. The scale of mapping generally reflects the intensity of land use. \r\n\r\nThe vector geodatabase has been cut into 7 shapefile tiles. This reduces the file size and enables more analysis. The extent of tiles is shown below:  \r\n•\tSwan Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth West Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tSouth Coast Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tNorthern Agricultural Region Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tPeel Harvey Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tAvon Natural Resource Management region,\r\n•\tRangelands Natural Resource Management region\r\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The echosounder's nominal frequency is 400 kHz (with a range of 200-700 kHz) and it operated in dual swath mode. \nData are stored in .kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are 158 files totalling 71.3 GB of raw data and 146 files totalling 424 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).\r\n\r\nDifferences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts. \r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2016-17\r\n* 2017-18\r\n* 2018-19\r\n* 2019-20\r\n* 2020-2021\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture and Water Resources\r\n* Attorney-General's\r\n* Communication and the Arts\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education and Training\r\n* Employment\r\n* Environment and Energy\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health\r\n* Human Services\r\n* Immigration and Border Protection\r\n* Industry, Innovation and Science\r\n* Infrastructure and Regional Development\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Human Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\n##Budget Paper Tables\r\nThe list below shows the data tables from the Budget Papers which are available in Excel and CSV formats.\r\n\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.1 – Agency Resourcing\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.2 – Special Appropriations\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 1.3 – Special Accounts\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 2.2 – Staffing Tables\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.1 – Departmental Expenses\r\n* Budget Paper 4 Table 3.2 – Net Capital Investment\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n\r\n1.\t09:30 15/05/2017 Updated machine-readable CSV file for Program Expenditure Components where applicable.

    "description": "Early in 1949, an extensive gravity survey was carried out between Sale and Orbost by R.H. Ray Co., U.S.A. for Lakes Oil Ltd. (Ray, 1949). The results of this survey were assessed by Professors Hills (1950) and Rudd (1950), Geological Consultants to Lakes Oil Ltd. As a result of their recommendations, supported by the Victorian Geological Survey, the Bureau of Mineral Resources was requested to carry out further geophysical work in the area. The work carried out by the Bureau includes gravity, seismic, and aeromagnetic surveys. In this record it is proposed to discuss the interpretation of the gravity results. As the Bureau's gravity work is complementary to the Ray Co. survey, the results of both surveys have been combined. The gravity work carried out by the Bureau was intended to provide more detail in some areas not fully covered by the Ray Co. survey, and to extend the margins of the survey on to the basement at the north, and along the coast on the south-east side. Most of the Bureau's work was in areas of difficult access, in swampy or sandy country. The following areas were covered. (1)The coastal area, between Lake Reeve and the sea. (2) Along the shore of Lake Wellington and adjacent areas. (3) To the south-west of Lake Wellington, to define the end of the Baragwanath anticline more closely. (4) In several areas west of Bairnsdale and north of Holland's Landing, to provide more detail on anomalies revealed by the Ray Co. survey. (5) To provide more detail on an anomaly near Giffard in the south-western part of the area. (6) Along several traverses northwards into the highlands.",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V01.\r\n\r\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS, Apr 16, 2011\r\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS, Apr 21, 2011\r\n\r\nCO2 System Overview:\r\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \r\n\r\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\r\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \r\n\r\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "title": "GBR - Dating and mapping historical changes in Great Barrier Reef coral communities, 2007 - 2010 (MTSRF 1.1.4, UQ)",
    "description": "Trajectories of decline have been observed in coral reefs throughout the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific region attributable to the synergistic effects of human-induced disturbances. Whilst direct and indirect evidence suggests that inshore reefs from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are showing signs of regional decline following European settlement in the mid 18th century, it has proven difficult to ascertain the link between anthropogenic disturbance and coral degradation on a regional scale. This is primarily due to the absence of detailed ecological baselines on the past condition of many of these reefs prior to the advent of long-term monitoring in the mid 1980¿s.\n\nAn understanding of the timing, frequency, duration and cause of mortality events in hard coral communities is necessary to help direct management efforts towards ameliorating potential impacts. Furthermore, assessing the spatial and temporal variability of changes in community structure before and after European settlement, will provide an invaluable management tool to overcome the ¿shifting baseline¿ syndrome.\n\nBy dating and mapping historical changes in coral communities of inshore reefs of the GBR, the purpose of this study is to provide a detailed baseline assessment on coral community structure and an accurate chronology on the history and nature of mortality events.\n\nDead coral skeletons have been dated using the highly-precise (2? ± up to 1 year) thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) uranium-series (U-series) dating method in order to determine 1) the timing of historical mortality in coral communities and massive Porites corals in the Palm Islands region (central Inshore GBR) and reefs adjacent to catchments in the southern GBR (Mackay region) and far northern GBR, 2) historical patterns of storm occurrence on the offshore GBR (One Tree and Heron Reefs), and 3) Holocene sea level changes from the inshore GBR (Magnetic Island).\n\nSo far, more than 320 samples have been dated at the Radiogenic Isotope Facility, University of Queensland. Our results have revealed shifts in coral community structure and a loss of previously dominant Acropora corals in the early 20th century in the Palm Islands region. It is theorized that this loss may be attributable to the synergistic impacts of declining water quality and climatic related factors. Analysis of uplifted reef blocks from the offshore GBR reveals a period of high storm activity throughout the 19th & 20th centuries. Furthermore, U-series dating of fossil massive corals from Magnetic Island suggests that sea level was higher than present around 2200 to 7000 years ago during the Holocene.\n\nOverall, our results show that U-series dating and palaeoecological approaches can provide unique insight into the GBR¿s past.\n\n\nData Units: U-series age (AD) ± 2-sigma error\n\n\nReferences:\n\n- Yu K.

    "title": "The Coronation Hill uranium prospect Katherine - Darwin area, Northern Territory",
    "description": "The uranium prospect at Coronation Hill is situated on the south side of the valley of the South Alligator River, 75 miles from the town of Pine Creek, from which it is accessible by trucks in the dry season. The surface showings consist of discontinuous exposures of autunite over an area approximately 400 feet square upon the north-eastern corner of Coronation Hill, an isolated feature within the river-valley. The rocks present are of Proterozoic age. Mineralization is found within two deeply-weathered members of a sedimentary-volcanic complex which forms the basal member of the Upper Proterozoic: the rocks of the prospect may be in part of Lower Proterozoic age. Sulphide mineralization accompanied by a secondary uranium mineral has been found at one point by diamond drilling: the sulphides are principally pyrite and the nickel sulphide bravoite. Mineralization is associated with a partly crushed and highly altered zone adjacent to a mass of Upper Proterozoic sandstone which overlaps the older and lower rocks. The structure is imperfectly understood and the control over mineralization has not been established. Development work, including costeaning, pitting, diamond drilling (1006 feet in two holes) and geophysical surveys (Radiometric, magnetic and electrical) has found no mineralization of economic grade, although it has shown the presence of alteration and sulphide mineralization which indicate that the full potentialities of the prospect have not yet been determined. Further work sufficient to complete preliminary exploration would require a minimum of 2500 feet of diamond drilling on underground operations at least equivalent to 1000 feet of drifting and crosscutting. Diamond drilling is somewhat preferable, since it can reach more deeply below the weathered zone. Only after completion of this additional work can it be determined whether or not the prospect is of economic value.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

The Areas are declared in legislation under the Fisheries Act 1994 and the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992. Two types of protection areas were established : Zone A has more stringent controls over netting practices. Foreshore set nets and offshore set and drift nets are prohibited in most Zone A protection areas. In Zone B mesh netting is permitted but with restrictions on the type, size and location of nets, and requirements for attendance at nets. Current March 2002.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of all women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAn antenatal visit is a planned visit between a pregnant woman and a midwife or doctor to assess and improve the wellbeing of the mother and baby throughout pregnancy. An antenatal visit does not include a visit where the sole purpose of contact is to confirm the pregnancy, or those contacts that occurred during the pregnancy that related to other non-pregnancy related issues. An antenatal visit in the first trimester is defined as occurring before 14 weeks' gestational age.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid\n\n\nIn WA and ACT, first antenatal visits that occur outside of the hospital may not be included, so these data should be interpreted with caution\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit for the area is less than 100\n\n",

    "description": "This project will determine the movement and habitat use of large predatory fishes such as sharks and coral trout in reef and coastal environments of the Great Barrier Reef. This project will employ acoustic monitoring technology in a series of inshore and offshore environments including coastal bays, inshore reefs and offshore reefs to monitor the presence and movements of predator species (elasmobranchs and teleosts). Mobile predators will be fitted with acoustic transmitters to define their presence and distribution, extent of movement and amount of connectivity between study locations (i.e., movement from bay to inshore reef, movement among reef platforms, etc.).  Predator presence and movement will be integrated with habitat mapping and environmental monitoring data to identify factors that lead to changes in movement patterns and to define any preferred locations or conditions that can be targeted for conservation or management.  Examination of use of habitats will provide information about the amount of time spent in various GBRMP zones and amount of movement among zones to assess the amount of protection provided under current management arrangements.",

White box - Yellow box - Blakely's red gum grassy woodland and derived grassland is a Critically Endangered Ecological Community under the EPBC Act 1999. The criteria for the EPBC community is slightly different to the ACT listed of the community Yellow box-Blakely's red gum grassy woodland and derived grassland community. \nMapping represents 'potential' distribution of the threatened ecological community (tec) as listing status of this community must be verified with field inspection.\nMapping product supersedes mapping completed by Maguire and Mulvaney in 2012 (see <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf\">https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2539609/25-box-gum-woodland-in-the-act-2011.pdf</a>).\nCaveat: This layer is indicative of likely habitat for threatened grassy box woodlands in the ACT but may not reflect the full distribution. Lack of identification of this community at a site does not necessarily indicate that the community does not occur there. For environmental impact assessment investigations, further survey may be required. \nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the layers are free from error. © Australian Capital Territory",
