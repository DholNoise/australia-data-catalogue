The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This spreadsheet provides historical time-series data for the cash aggregates - cash receipts, cash payments and net cash flows - of the general government sector and includes forecasts from the 2014-2015 Budget.\nThe Cash Flow Statement shows the trends in general government sector aggregate cash flows over the period 1986-87 to 2014-15. This table of historical data has been compiled as far as possible on an AAS basis, and from 2004-05 onwards, is consistent with the AASB 1049 cash flow statement presentation.\nThe data from 1997-98 include the transactions of government schools and arts institutions on a gross operating basis, as well as the full trading operations of TAFE institutes and hospitals, nursing homes and ambulances. Although this expanded coverage does not materially influence the net operating result for the general government sector, it does significantly increase the inflows and outflows presented in the cash flow statement. \nThe general government sector comprises all government departments, offices and other bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. General government services include those which are mainly non-market in nature, those which are largely for collective consumption by the community and those which involve the transfer or redistribution of income.",

This is a land use nomenclature and classification scheme for Australia, ordering land use in a systematic, logical and consistent way. The ALUM Classification has been developed in collaboration with national, state and territory agencies as part of the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). \r\n\r\n This document updates Part 2 of the  Guidelines for land use mapping in Australia: principles, procedures and definitions, 4th Edition published by ABARES in 2011. It reflects current needs and experience in classifying land use of national, state and territory agency partners involved in ACLUMP. \r\n\r\n The ALUM Classification has a three-tiered hierarchical structure. Primary, secondary and tertiary classes are broadly structured by the potential degree of modification and the impact on a putative 'natural state' (essentially, a native land cover).

The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of unpublished Department of Health data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nThe rates by PHN should be interpreted with caution as these services are predominantly provided in non-metropolitan areas. Rates were calculated for some metropolitan areas for comparison purposes, as these areas were only included in the program from 2014–15, and only a small number of services were provided there\n\n\nPatients may have more than 1 occasion of service.\n\n\nThe identification of Indigenous patients varies between practitioners, so the number of occasions of service for Indigenous patients may be understated.\n\n",

Water level data for 18 sites across the Gippsland Lakes are recorded from November 1998 to May 2002 as 12-minute interval, time-centred readings with 10-second window averages.  The data was collected at high-resolution spatial and temporal coverage to facilitate an analysis of Lakes level behaviour and hydrodynamic model (HDM) calibration.  The data is accessible through the software \"Lakes Explorer\" version 5.0, written by Dr K.S. Tan in Microsoft® Excel 2000© Visual Basic® for Application (Excel VBA).  The \"Lakes Explorer\" has six basic functions: Import File, Draw Chart, Navigate database, Regenerate/Recalculate Level, Export File, and Animate Profile",

    "description": "This project will act as an integrating focus within the rainforest theme to strategically target research gaps and thereby increase our understanding of the drivers of rainforest biodiversity. We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. \n\nThe project consists of four subprojects:\n\nA. Monitoring: Tasks include a microsensor network, standardised vertebrate surveys, habitat structure monitoring and data harvesting from other projects. \n\nA comprehensive review of regional literature followed by extensive stakeholder consultation identified long-term monitoring data as the most important knowledge gap in the region (Welbergen et al. 2011). This sub-project is aimed at maintaining and significantly improving a regional-scale, long-term environmental monitoring program that provides biodiversity and environmental data that has a demonstrated value to a wide range of users including the research community, regional/state/national management agencies and conservation policy development, and national / international bioinformatic infrastructure initiatives (e.g. ALA, TERN). Data collected and maintained here will provide the primary input for the other sub-projects described below with flow-on inputs to many of the other proposed projects across the rainforest node. These data will include but not be limited to:\n1. Regional microclimate sensor network at more than 30 sites established under MTSRF that are strategically placed across elevational and latitudinal gradients in the region.\no Replace and upgrade existing microclimate stations (now defunct/worn out)\no Establish standardised microclimate logging stations in new sites in gaps in environmental coverage, identified climatic refugia, peripheral habitat isolates and increased coverage of the rainforest edge habitats (e.g. wet sclerophyll). Data: temperature (air, soil, microhabitats), humidity, soil moisture, cloud interception.\n2. Standardised vertebrate surveys across all long-term sites (>30) including:\no  2-4 complete surveys per year for three years with 6 replicated sampling points within each site and including standardised surveys of: birds, reptiles, spotlighting (mammals and other nocturnal fauna) and microhylid frogs, with potential to add specific other groups dependent on student projects. \no These surveys follow well-established and extensively published methodologies within the CTBCC (e.g. Williams et al. Ecology 2010).  \n3. Habitat structure monitoring will be continued and improved at all monitoring sites both directly by this project and via site-based collaboration with other projects including rainforest dynamics project (Project 10 - Laurance) and plant genetics (Project 9 -Crayn). \n4. Link to Project 14: potential monitoring of vegetation structure and thermal properties using UAV technology to capture aerial photos, multispectral remote sensing, Lidar vegetation structure, thermal imagery of habitat and fauna, cyclone damage and canopy condition.\n5. Additional monitoring data will be harvested across the node for increased regional and taxonomic coverage and baseline data improvements via links and data exchange with Projects 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 25. \n\n\nB. Climate change vulnerability and adaptation: Includes the production of downscaled regional climate projections, projected changes in species distribution models, composite biodiversity maps, identification and mapping of climate refugia, predictive models of impacts on biodiversity including extreme events. \n\nClimate change is arguably the single largest threat to biodiversity in Australia and the unique biodiversity of the Wet Tropics rainforests is recognised as one of the most threatened ecosystems globally (IPCC 4th AR). This subproject will build on previous and existing research to provide cutting-edge predictions on climate change impacts, vulnerability assessment and adaptation options for rainforest biodiversity. We will link closely with the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Network to ensure that outputs, tools and approaches are distributed across this network for maximum national and regional benefit and outcomes.  Specific objectives and collaborative links include:\n1. Produce and make available downscaled regional climate projections using eight Global Climate Models across multiple (at least 3) emission scenarios at 10 year time steps from 1970-2080 for more than 50 bioclimatic variables;\n2. Projected changes, including uncertainty estimates, in species distribution models and composite biodiversity maps for the majority of rainforest vertebrates, 500+ species of invertebrates, major vegetation types and some key ecosystem processes (baseline data for these analyses were collected under MTSRF and ongoing projects within the CTBCC);\n3. Identify and map climatic refugia (extension of previous MTSRF work that mapped landscape-scale temperature refugia by Shoo et al. 2010a, 2010b). This analysis will expand previous work to include finer scale microhabitat refugia and also increase the generality of the analyses by examining moisture refugia and dry season drought events that have been shown to have significant impacts on biodiversity (Williams & Middleton 2008, Middleton & Williams in review). \n4. Produce predictive impact models on biodiversity that explicitely include a consideration of extreme events rather than just environmental means/averages. Project will link closely with the extreme climate events project (Project 16 ¿ Welbergen) to incorporate the impacts of changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and extent of extreme events, such as heat waves and droughts, as a major component of assessing relative vulnerability and adaptation actions; \n5. Project will closely collaborate with Project 15 (Phillips, Llewelyn) examining the potential for useful local adaptation to climate changeextremes in isolated populations. This link explores the potential to utilise existing adaptive potential as a means to increase species resilience to climate change.\n6. Other external links:\n¿ NCCARF Refugia project (National) -  proposed\n¿ NCCARF Terrestrial Biodiversity Research Network\n¿ Northern Biodiversity NERP Hub\n¿ AEDA Hub ¿ Restoration project and Future Fellowship (Wintle) examining demographic modelling and climate change.\n7. Incorporate IPCC 5th Assessment Report climate models and scenarios into all above analyses, once they become available.\n\nC. Synthesis, analysis and integration: Determinants of biodiversity: Includes mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and 200+ species of invertebrates, identify key monitoring locations, examining the relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure. \n\nAn understanding of the drivers of biodiversity in the region is crucial to predicting impacts from a variety of threats and ensuring effective conservation planning and management that aims to maintain a resilient landscape. We will use data collected in subproject A in combination with our existing extensive vertebrate and invertebrate database to examine the drivers of biodiversity in the region and to provide the resources and knowledge to make this useful to stakeholders. Specific objectives will include, but not be limited to: \n1. Mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and >500 species of invertebrates (distribution and abundance) with emphasis on threatened species;\n2. Identify key locations and taxa where we have long-term count data and/or high frequency of repeat count surveys over time periods that have encompassed important environmental change. We will undertake statistical power analyses to evaluate condition and trends of species (e.g., range shifts, change in population size);\n3. Analyses will also inform the design of our ongoing monitoring program (subproject A) to maximise the detection of change in a cost-effective manner. \n4. Comprehensive habitat/vegetation type vulnerability assessment;\n5. Examine a range of environmental and evolutionary drivers of biodiversity to provide the basic scientific underpinnings for evidence-based policy and management in the region including paleostability of habitat; seasonal habitat and climatic stability, relationships to ecosystem processes such as net primary productivity, habitat structure and heterogeneity, species and habitat compositional turnover and evolutionary biology.\n6. Examine relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure (vegetation type and structure, habitat extent, connectivity etc.)\n\nD. Status, trends and future projections: Includes Producing a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets.\n\nNo practical measure currently exists to evaluate trends in biodiversity values at the ¿whole-of-region¿ scale in near real-time on a regular, repeatable and affordable basis (WTMA Research Strategy 2010-2014). We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. This will be the major vehicle for synthesizing, integrating and communicating data from all projects. This project will make use of extensive computing power represented by the collaboration between the CTBCC and the James Cook University eResearch group and High Performance Computing Facility. Specific objectives:\n1. Produce and make publicly available a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets based on a user-defined spatial area that will return all predicted and observed data within the query area for climate (past, current and future projections), habitat, species (predicted and observed), biodiversity values, terrain, ecosystem processes and, where available data is site-based, the tool could query the temporal patterns in the data (e.g. changes in abundance of a species) with ¿approaching real-time¿ updates (expected bi-annual upload of all new biodiversity and environmental data with temporal resolution dependent on the specific data stream, example quarterly for the standardised vertebrate surveys).\n2. Automatic upload, synthesis and visualisation in JCU eResearch group (Tropical Data Hub) including time series examination of trends;\n3. Automated upload via Tropical Data Hub onto National (ALA, TERN, NPEI) and international (GBIF) data infrastructure. This means that as data is entered into our system from the monitoring program and other projects, it will be uploaded and available via national and international data portals;\n4. Future forecasting of trends and forecasts via combination of modelling and workshopping to conduct future horizon scanning.\n\nOnce established, these bioinformatic tools could form the basis for UNESCO, and Queensland and Australian government reporting on the state of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and could easily be utilized more generally across other ecosystems in Australia.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with imaging costs, and out-of-pocket cost per diagnostic imaging service attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDiagnostic imaging services are Medicare-subsidised diagnostic imaging procedures such as x-rays, computerised tomography scans, ultrasound scans, magnetic resonance imaging scans and nuclear medicine scans.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Alpine Redspot Dragonfly (Austropetalia tonyana) is a\nmoderate-sized dragonfly. The larvae grow to 32-35mm long and\nadults grow to 70-80mm long. It is a habitat specialist, occurring only\nwithin very specific geographic locations. It is naturally rare, with few\nrecordings of the species in New South Wales since the 1950s. In\nNSW, the Alpine Redspot Dragonfly is restricted to mountainous\nregions below 35°S that reach above 600 – 1,800 metres above\nsea level. Individuals have extremely specific habitat requirements in\nthat they only occur amongst rocks, logs and moss within the splash\nzone of waterfalls or in the nearby stream edge.\nThey are an endangered species -\nhttps://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/speciesprotection/conservation/what-current/vulnerable-species/alpineredspot-dragonfly. \nThe methods used to create the predicted current\ndistribution of Alpine Redspot Dragonfly are described fully in: NSW\nDepartment of Primary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community\nStatus 2015 – Final Report.\nAll available records of the species were collated and assessed for\naccuracy. For current distribution, only records after 1 January 1994\nwere used. Within the framework of the Australian Hydrological\nGeospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network, the records were\nassociated with attributes from the National Environmental Stream\nAttributes Database and River Styles® geomorphology. The\nAustralian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network (Geofabric) is a fully connected and directed stream network\nbased a 9 second DEM. It allocates a unique stream segment\nnumber to each river reach in Australia. The Environmental\nAttributes Database is a set of lookup tables supplying attributes\ndescribing the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the\nstream and catchment environment that was developed by the\nAustralian National University (ANU) in 2011 and updated in 2012.\nThe data is supplied as part of the supplementary Geofabric\nproducts which is associated with the 9 second DEM derived\nstreams and the National Catchment Boundaries based on 250k\nscale stream network. 30 Stream variables were assessed for the\nmodelling.\nRiver Styles® provides a high resolution categorical classification of\nriver character within a nested hierarchy of criteria based on valley\nsetting, channel planform, geomorphic units, and bed material. The\nNSW Office of Water compiled a spatial dataset of River Styles®\nclassifications for a large number of the waterways of NSW. From 65\nRiver Style® categories we generated two new fields representing\nPlanform (34 categories) and Substratum (8 categories) for each\nstream segment. River Style® planform and substratum categories\nwere then assigned to each Geofabric segment.\nMaxEnt 3.3.3 is a widely used species distribution modelling program\nthat utilises presence records to generate probabilities of occurrence\nbased on a suite of environmental variables quantified across the\narea of interest. It was used to model the current geographic\ndistribution of each listed threatened freshwater aquatic species or\npopulation. We utilised logistic output to plot the predicted\ndistribution of each species. This output equates to a probability that\nthe species will be observed in each river reach, given the\nenvironmental conditions that exist there relative to the\nenvironmental conditions where the species is known to occur. For\nthis mapping, above 33% probability was considered predicted\npresence. In addition, predicted separate populations were\nconnected by manual interpretation. The predicted values for each\nriver reach were converted from the Geofabric framework to the\nhigher resolution 2013 NSW Strahler Stream Order Hydroline.",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.   \n \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 4m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "Geodiversity is fundamental to the integrity of broader ecological processes. It is also important in contributing to the richness and interest of our environment and in providing opportunities for scientific study of the earth's development. \n\nSome elements of geodiversity are relatively robust in the face of human intervention; others are susceptible to degradation associated with a range of land use practices. An effective approach to geoconservation must include the development and implementation of protective management principles designed specifically to protect the vulnerable elements of geodiversity.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:100000 scale) detailing geological, geomorphological, and soil sites of conservation and heritage value. Geoconservation sites are given a unique code and the relevant National Estate values and criteria. The coverage also has an attached relate file detailing name of site, mapsheet on which site is located, size classification of site, sensitivity of the site to impacts, conservation status, National Estate status, National Estate criteria against which the site has been assessed etc.\n\nNational Estate criteria against which Geoconservation sites can be assessed include:\nA1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate.\nA2: Importance in maintaining existing processes or natural systems at the regional or national scale.\nA3: Importance in exhibiting unusual richness or diversity of flora, fauna, landscapes or cultural features.\nB1: Importance for rare, endangered or uncommon flora, fauna, communities, ecosystems, natural landscapes or phenomena, or as wilderness.\nC1: Importance for information contributing to a wider understanding of Australian natural history, by virtue of its use as a research site, teaching site, type locality, reference or benchmark site.\nC2: Importance for information contributing to a wider understanding of the history of human occupation of Australia.\nD1: Importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the range of human activities in the Australian environment.\nH1: Importance for close associations with individuals whose activities have been significant within the history of the nation, State or region.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1997-1999.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal:- https://portal.aodn.org.au. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.

This specific dataset presents the median rental costs of 3 bedroom flats by the 2016 Local Government Areas geographic level.\nThe rent figures included in the Rental Report are weekly median rents. Median rents represent the midpoint in the distribution of all rents. Fifty per cent of rents are higher than the median and fifty per cent are below the median.\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\n*Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset\r\nof forest and non-forest land over which Indigenous peoples and\r\ncommunities have ownership, management, or rights of use, assembled\r\nfor *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from\r\nmultiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets\r\nrelated to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous\r\nland dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the\r\nForests of Australia (2018) dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies Indigenous land into four categories:\r\n*Indigenous owned and managed: freehold land that is both owned\r\nand managed by Indigenous communities\r\n*Indigenous managed: land that is managed, but not owned, by\r\nIndigenous communities; and lands that are owned by Indigenous\r\npeople but have formal shared management agreements with\r\nAustralia and state and territory government agencies\r\n*Indigenous co-managed: land that is owned and managed by other\r\nparties, but has a formal, legally binding agreement in place that\r\nincludes input from Indigenous people in the process of\r\ndeveloping and implementing a management plan\r\n*Other Special rights: land subject to native title determination,\r\nregistered Indigenous land use agreement, and legislated special\r\ncultural use provision.\r\n\r\nThe *Australia’s Indigenous forest estate (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "In the context of Australia as a whole, Tasmania, as a region, is not regarded as exceptionally diverse for most floral groups. This pattern is consistent with the usual tropical-temperate diversity shift seen in most parts of the world. On a regional basis, however, some areas are obviously significant in terms of flora species richness.  \n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criterion A3: Importance in exhibiting unusual richness or diversity of flora, fauna, landscapes or cultural features\n\nThe assessment for this criterion was divided into two areas of analysis: the richness of flora species and the richness of forest communities. Species-level richness is often referred to as alpha (a), or within-area, diversity and is usually measured as the number of species occurring within an area of a given size. Forest community richness is effectively a surrogate measure of the rate of change of species: a between-area, or beta (b) diversity, measure. It is often a good reflection of environmental diversity, where strong gradients produce rapid transitions of different forest communities and their associated species.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:500 000 scale) detailing sites with a high flora species or community richness. Species richness and community richness of flora are coded with a unique number, the relevant National Estate values and criteria, and cleared land status.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was derived by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the History field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThis boundary was developed in consultation with the Northern Territory Government and is informed by the principles described in the draft Northern Territory Strategic Regional Environmental Bioregional Assessment Framework.   For terrestrial ecosystems these are:\r\n\r\nFor the ecology domains of the SREBA, the boundary should be determined following consideration of the following spatial areas: \r\n•\tbiogeographical boundaries \r\n•\tgeological (sub)basin boundaries with the gas resource\r\n•\tencompass the spatial distribution of ecological values on which gas development in that region could feasibly have an impact, including predictable indirect impacts; and\r\n•\tinclude sufficient bioregional extent to provide adequate context to assess the significance of any potential impact.   \r\nIn general, these boundaries should correspond to IBRA sub-bioregions.  However, additional consideration should be given to:\r\n•\twhere gas development can feasibly only occur in one part of a large region, sub-regional boundaries may be appropriate\r\n•\twhere only a small portion of a bioregion overlaps the edge of a gas (sub)basin, that entire bioregion cannot be cost-effectively be incorporated in the SREBA, so only a portion of that subregion should be included \r\n•\twhere there is potential for significant downstream impacts from development (notably on the quality or quantity of ground- or surface water), the boundary may extend out of the bioregion where development will occur, likely following (sub)catchment boundaries.          \r\n\r\nThe principles for aquatic ecosystems are similar, with a stronger emphasis on catchment or sub-catchment boundaries, and the extent of underlying aquifers that support ground-water dependent ecosystems; and also noting the need to sensibly limit the spatial extent of the study  in relation to downstream catchment areas, especially where there is no feasible impact pathway.\r\n\r\nThese principles were applied to derive the proposed Beetaloo GBA extended region boundary, primarily based on the boundaries of the Birdum (STU3) and Newcastle (STU2) subregions of the Sturt Plateau Bioregion.  In order to explain where and why it deviates from these subregions boundaries, starting at the northern edge and moving counter clockwise:\r\n-\tthe northern edge follows the bioregion boundary.  Importantly, this corresponds to the Roper River in the Mataranka springs area.  For this section, the boundary has been extended to capture the Mataranka Thermal Pools. The north western edge also captures the springs feeding toward the Flora River, but may need to check this and adjust slightly so that these GDEs are included\r\n-\ton the western edge, the boundary diverts from the bioregion and follows the boundary of the Daly and then Roper Drainage Basins, and then cuts southward to rejoin the southern boundary of the Newcastle subregion.  This pragmatically exclude some of the most western extent of STU3 and STU2, which are geographically distant from the gas basin, and which are unlikely to add useful regional context to any of the ecology values. The GDE’s on the King River in the northwest have been included within the boundary.\r\n-\tIt is considered essential to include Lake Woods in the study area, so a portion of the boundary of Mitchell Grass Downs (MGD2) is used to do this. The boundary then cuts across the top of the Mitchell Grass Downs to rejoin the STU2 boundary\r\n-\tThe boundary cuts north to meet and use the western boundary of the McArthur River Basin – this excludes the most eastern extent of STU2, for similar reasons as above for excluding the most western extent\r\n-\tIn the eastern section, the most easterly extent of the Beetaloo sub-basin just enters the Gulf Fall Bioregion.  This is ecologically very different to the Sturt Plateau, and so the requirement to sample in this area needs to be sensibly constrained.  A 20km buffer from the edge of the gas basin.  The boundary therefore encompasses the headwaters of some drainages that flow into the Limmen and Roper Rivers.   \r\n-\tThe boundary then follows the STU bioregion boundary back to the northern edge.   This includes the upper reaches of the Strangways River and Maryfield Creek.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was derived using: NTGS Beetaloo Sub-basin boundary (A7710381-78BF-4E1F-B015-A9E874599F47), the DoEE Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (Subregions - States and Territories) v. 7 (IBRA) (F83F319E-C369-4548-BBEC-3AAD7AB40AE8), and GBA Beetaloo basin GDE (E4C2B147-8338-4821-BC5E-DE300E9B6362) as its data sources.",

By collecting information on fire and incidents FIRS assists with better understanding of the prevalence of each incident and contributing factors to incidents.

The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2011 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2008 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who were admitted to any hospital in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to the leading causes of death by sex. The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Local Government Area (LGA) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any LGA with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 6. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/tenure-of-australia-s-forests-2023\r\n\r\n*Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of\r\nnational land tenure types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests\r\nReport 2018*. It was developed from land tenure information from multiple\r\nsources, including contributions from Australian, state and territory\r\ngovernment agencies and external sources. The tenure dataset is then\r\ncombined with forest cover information sourced from the *Forests of\r\nAustralia (2018)* dataset: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2018\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nResource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest\r\nInventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and\r\nstate and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate\r\nand communicate information on Australia’s forests. The NFI applies a\r\nnational classification to state and territory data to allow seamless\r\nintegration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external\r\ndata are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies land tenure into six national tenure classes suitable for\r\napplication to forest: Leasehold forest, Multiple-use public forest, Nature\r\nconservation reserve, Other Crown land, Private forest and Unresolved\r\ntenure.\r\n\r\nThe *Tenure of Australia’s forests (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil\r\nrequirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the\r\n*Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian\r\nGovernment for domestic and international reporting.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

This is time series data from water quality and seafood industry monitoring programs. As such this is a good resource for monitoring the occurrences of harmful algal bloom (HAB) and nuisance species in Australian coastal waters. Whilst this collection documents the abundances of HAB taxa, it can not be used to confirm the presence of any toxin. Most of the data are considered near shore or estuarine. The data are given in cells per litre of water for abundances, although some taxa are marked as present if they were seen in a sample but not in the formal count. Each verifiable taxon has been assigned an Aphia_id from the World Register of Marine Species website (WoRMS) where the full taxonomy of that entity can be found. If the Aphia_id is missing then the taxon name is not currently recognised by WoRMS.\nData have been contributed by:\nHornsby Council NSW &amp; Microalgal solutions\nNSW Food Authority &amp; Microalgal solutions\nTasmanian EPA &amp; Analytical Services Tasmania (AST)",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nThe data only includes a small number of mothers aged less than 15.\n\n\nDenominators are based on the estimated resident population of females aged 15-19 by state and territory and PHN.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months from January 2020 to June 2021 and includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nDefinition: Mean annual dissolved concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil\nwater (mg of nitrogen per kg of water), averaged for both soil layers.\nInterpretation: The dissolved N concentration is calculated as the ratio of\nthe mineral N store to soil water store, which assumes that all the mineral N\nis in solution. Rainfall has a strong influence on the pattern of both these\nstores, but not on their ratio. The pattern of mineral N concentrations is\nexplained by the effect of air dryness (saturation deficit) on the mineral N\nstore (mainly controlled by NPP) which is greater than the effect of air\ndryness on the soil water store (mainly determined by rainfall or energy\nlimitation). This gives a pattern of N concentration in soil water that\ndecreases as the climate-average air dryness increases from temperate to semi-\narid tropical environments. Notes: These are model-based estimates from the\nBiosEquil model. Results are given for the aBasea (pre-1788) and aAgrica\n(present day) conditions. The aAgrica case includes (1) current agricultural\ninputs of water from irrigation; (2) current agricultural inputs of nutrients\n(nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertiliser, legume crops, and legume pastures;\n(3) current nutrient offtakes by product removal (harvest, stock).\nNMnlConc0.Agric a Mean annual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water\n(mgN kgH2O-1) in the aAgrica (present day) scenario NMnlConc0.Base a Mean\nannual concentration of mineral nitrogen in soil water (mgN kgH2O-1) in the\naBasea (pre-1788) scenario Data is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_cmnswr9cl\n__02811a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The museum’s collection dates back to 1854 and comprises natural sciences (including zoological, palaeontological, and geological specimens) and humanities (including indigenous cultures, history and technology collections). The museum cares for an estimated 17 million items, many of which are grouped together as a single entry in the electronic cataloguing system. \nThe MV Collections website provides access to over 1.15 million records, representing items in the Humanities collection; specimens in the Sciences collection; articles written about significant people, places and parts of the collection; and species profiles written about animals that can be observed in the wild. A search may deliver results across items, species, specimens or article records. Results can be refined by adding a new search term to the existing query, or by using the supplied filters.

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Ferry Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2021",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "The EAC5 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.1 S, 155.3 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015.  \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

From 2016 onwards, data presented is based on Aboriginal status reported in the National Schools Statistics Collection (NSSC) conducted each August.\n\n\nHSC Record of Achievement includes those students awarded the HSC and who have completed one or more HSC courses but have not yet been awarded the HSC. \n\n\nHSC Record of Achievement includes students who participated in HSC pathways. \n\n\nHSC pathways offer a flexible program for students to complete the HSC over a period of up to five years. The pathways provisions include accumulating courses, repeating courses, acceleration, recognition of prior learning, and combining study with part-time traineeships or apprenticeships.\n\n\nBradfield college is included.\n\n\nData derived from NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) data, provided in February each year. \n\n\nSource: \n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

English class size is an indication of the size of classes in secondary schools, as almost all students study English. This includes each compulsory and elective English class for secondary students held during the week of the census. Secondary students not studying English are NOT counted in the class size return. Also included are classes (such as Remedial English or ESL / English as a Second Language) that a student attends instead of compulsory English. Excluded are classes such as English Literature, Remedial English or ESL that a student attends as well as “compulsory” English. Please note that extra teaching support is NOT included when calculating the average class size. Average class size is NOT the same as the student/teacher ratio.",

The project includes:\n<ul><li>a new web portal to make it easier for the community to report wombats to capture where in the landscape healthy and unhealthy populations of wombats are occurring and so wildlife volunteers can quickly assess treatment options available.(please contact access Canberra for wildlife injured on our roads requiring immediate attention)</li><li>a new spatial support tool that maps wombat populations to help us understand the extent of mange and its effects on populations and to facilitate coordinated monitoring and treatment</li><li>an innovative research effort that will trial the remote delivery of a more effective and longer lasting mange treatment ACT Wildlife and Wombat Rescue are partnering with government on the project in an excellent example of how government and community volunteers can work together for good outcomes for a species in trouble. The University of Tasmania is providing advice from its own research and trials.</li></ul>\n\nThe wombat mange project progresses a commitment under the Parliamentary Agreement of the 10th Legislative Assembly to fund ACT Wildlife to undertake mange treatment in the ACT. Collaboratively, the ACT Government and community volunteers will deliver a coordinated and comprehensive mange treatment program across the ACT.\n\nThe project is part of a wider wombat management project being developed within ACT Government.

    "description": "This dataset and accompanying RMarkdown notebook document the analysis and efforts to consolidate spatial data on coastal protection structures, such as sea walls, groynes, and wharfs, across Australia's coastline. The project addresses the urgent need for a national-level dataset by sourcing data from various state governments and identifying gaps in coverage. The dataset integrates contributions from OpenStreetMap (OSM), Smartline, and state-based government databases, resulting in a research-quality geospatial file. Key attributes include the location and type of coastal structures, with data standardised for consistency across regions. Limitations are noted, such as the absence of government-supplied data for certain regions and potential accuracy issues with OSM-sourced information. The dataset is intended for research purposes, supporting efforts to assess coastal risks and guide future protection measures. Ongoing updates to datasets will extend to not only consider engineered hard structures but also include datasets of nature-based coastal protection (e.g., restored reefs and coastal vegetation).",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2020 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending March 2019. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "All government primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have school zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas).\nSchool zones were produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nSchool zones defined as metropolitan have taken preference over school zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of school zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some school zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website.\nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes the central part of the suburb of Picnic\nPoint. The northern part of the catchment is predominantly urban; the southern part includes parts of\nthe Georges River National Park, in particular the Yeramba Lagoon. The catchment drains gradually\nsouth, through a stormwater pipe network towards the Georges River. The Sydney South Electricity\nSubstation is also located within the Picnic Point catchment. The Picnic Point catchment is wholly\nwithin the southern section of Bankstown City Council Local Government Area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 170 stormwater pits and 200 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Picnic Point Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

    "description": "Remotely sensed topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) information were acquired for targeted sections of the NSW mid-north coast using Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB - a combination of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) sensors) during November - December 2013. This resource defines total area of 139 km2 of data covering areas around the locations of 1) Lake Cathie and 2) Old Bar. Data were acquired by Pelydryn Ltd on behalf of NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (now the Department of Planning and Environment) using a HawkEye IIb bathymetric LiDAR system aboard VH-CWG Aircraft. Funding was provided through NSW Office of Environment and Heritage to acquire high-quality, high-resolution baseline data to support coastal erosion studies. The survey requirement was to provide high-resolution data at a minimum of 5 x 5 m laser spot spacings from the mean high-water mark to ~200m inland, and from the shore, seaward (LADS - bathymetry) up to maximum ~5km offshore (~20-40m water depth depending on in-water conditions). Positioning data were collected on the ellipsoid ITRF 2014 GRS80 in UTM Z56 and post-processed using local base stations (CORSnet NSW) to provide a Post Processed Kinematic GNSS solution for final aircraft trajectory before being applied to all data. Data types available are as GeoTiff (L3) or classified LAS format point cloud (L2) issued transformed to GDA94 Z56. Other data types may be available as ESRI topo-bathy rasters and contours, tab delimited ascii XYZ, unclassified LAS format data, relative reflectance data (terrestrial, marine) and Quality Control (QC) documentation (contained within survey report) via the NSW DPE Information Asset Register (IAR) (metadata, coverage shape), SEED (https://seed.nsw.gov.au or upon request.  Users note: these surveys achieved maximum depths of ~15m and some artefacts may be apparent in the nearshore potentially associated with in-water conditions (i.e. algae; turbidity). The data are intended to inform coastal and marine management and are ‘not for navigation’.",

    "description": "Site C is sampled monthly by the Derwent Estuary Program as part of the  Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

Important results published in our 53-page Phys. Rev. X paper (2021) include the first measurements of higher-order light-propagation effects and of the relativistic deformation of the orbit and highlight the importance of a long term observational campaign, including VLBI observations, for this remarkable system. The main aims of this proposal are to provide the strongest tests to date for general relativity and to measure for the first time the moment-of-inertia of a neutron star. Additionally, we will determine the system geometry, map the pulsar beams via geodetic precession, and search for the reappearance of Pulsar B. We exploit the high sensitivity and broad bandwidth of the UWL receiver. We are collaborating with the MeerKAT Double Pulsar Timing team to optimise combination of MeerKAT and UWL data.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2017 car parking event data there are 3,858 records where the parking event goes into 2018 and ends at midnight.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/u9sa-j86i.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.13GB, 35.9 million rows)",

    "description": "The Kimberley 100m mooring (IMOS platform code KIM100) is part of the Kimberley array. It was initially deployed on the 01/02/2012 at (15.69 S, 121.96 E). The site depth is 95m. This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",
