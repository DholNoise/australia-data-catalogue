These assets are managed by City Presentation, Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate (TCCS) and Parks and Conservation Service, Environment and Planning Directorate (EPD). Privately managed playgrounds and playgrounds managed by other ACT Government Directorates are not included. Polygons in the Playarea dataset are more precisely recorded (defined by the softfall boundaries) than those in the Playground dataset. If a less precise but smaller dataset is suitable please refer to the Playground dataset. These assets are captured and maintained in the TCCS asset database through the works as executed (WAE) handover process or field audits.",

The voyage’s first leg transited from Hobart to Nuku’alofa (10–19 Aug 2025), where science participants boarded. A mid-voyage transfer occurred on 05 Sep, and all science personnel disembarked in Nuku’alofa on 23 Sep before the final transit to Brisbane (23 Sep–1 Oct 2025).\n\nThe Kongsberg EM712 multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry and backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter data.\n\nThe EM712 provides a 0.5° by 1° transmit and receive angular resolution respectively. The echosounder's nominal frequency range is from 40 to 100 kHz. \n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. \n\nThere are 131 files totalling 17.8 GB of raw data and 131 files totalling 92.9 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

    "title": "Opal Trips - Train and Metro",
    "description": "This dataset contains Official Train and Metro Utilisation figures. Opal tap-on/tap-off data (representing an individual entering &amp; exiting a station), is allocated to a line and aggregated to a monthly figure for the estimated number of trips.\nStarting July 1, 2024, the methodology for calculating trip numbers for individual lines and operators will change to more accurately reflect the services our passengers use within the transport network. This new approach will apply to trains, metros, light rail, and ferries, and will soon be extended to buses. Aggregations between line, agency, and mode levels will no longer be valid, as a passenger may use multiple lines on a single trip. Trip numbers at the line, operator, or mode level should be used as reported, without further combinations.\nThe dataset includes reports based on both the new and old methodologies, with a transition to the new method taking place over the coming months. As a result of this change, caution should be exercised when analysing longer trends that utilise both datasets.           More information on NRT ROAM can be accessed\nhere\nNotes:  \n(1) The timetable change on 26 November 2017 results in new line definitions and patronage splits by line for the period 26-30 November and all subsequent months.  \n(2) A more accurate methodology for assigning trips to train line and operator has been applied to patronage from July 2017 onwards resulting in changes a revision to July – November 2017 patronage previously reported.\nCaution  \n\n\nSchool Student travel using concessional Opal cards is included. However this may be underrepresented, due to inconsistent tap-on/tap-off behaviour by students  \n\n\nMagnetic Stripe Ticketing (MST – paper tickets) data was also available in July 2016. MST patronage data for July is available here  \n\n\nOpal data may be subject to minor revision for the two months following upload  \n\n\nData is static at a point in time, and may not match other reports that are real time  \n\n\nAll non-Opal travel is excluded, for example transport concession entitlement cards, integrated ticketing for major events, and fare non-compliance  \n\n\nAn Opal Trip is defined as a tap-on/tap-off pair (including where only a single tap-on or tap-off is recorded)  \n\n\nThe timetable change on 26 November 2017 results in new line definitions with new patronage splits. This change makes patronage comparisons by line inconsistent before and after this date. The splits by line will be continually updated each month to adjust for changes in commuter behaviour in response to the change in timetable.  \n\n\nHistorical data may change as new Opal data and patronage line splits becomes available for reporting.  \n\n\nStation Link, a high frequency bus service temporarily replaces train services for the closure of Macquarie University, Macquarie Park and North Ryde train stations while upgrading to Sydney Metro Northwest standards. Effective from 30th September 2018 for approximately 7 months.\n\n\nSydney Metro North West commenced operations May 2019.\n\n\nSydney Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line, Chatswood to Sydenham commenced operations 19 August 2024.\n\n",

    "description": "In recent years the term 'enhanced greenhouse effect' has become well known in modern society and yet aspects of this possible 'future climate' are poorly understood. The characteristics of the geological record provide a basis to understand this possible future climate through the examination of alternating glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) stages. Understanding the variability of sea-surface temperature and biological processes in the water column provides insight into general circulation of present and paleo-ocean currents. At a core site off Western Australia (MD002361, 113.477166 E, 22.082 S) the highest annual SST estimate (Tmean) of 29.1oC ± 0.84oC was recorded during MIS 5, 1.6oC warmer than the modern recorded Tmean. Most interglacial periods were equivalent or warmer than present apart from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7. The most extreme glacial to interglacial transition was from the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6) to the last interglacial (MIS 5) with a temperature range of 8.7oC ± 0.84oC. The mixed layer is also thinner during interglacial periods compared to the glacial periods.",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "From 10 to 17 April 1997, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) chartered the 85 m Research Vessel Melville from Scripps Institution of Oceanography on a cooperative scientific basis, to map the sea bed east and northeast of Tasmania including the deep water part of the Gippsland Basin. The vessel was equipped with the SeaBeam 2000 multibeam sonar system, capable of swath-mapping the morphology and roughness of the sea bed in a swath 3.5 times as wide as the water depth. The central beam gave a 12 kHz bathymetric profile. Other equipment employed included a magnetometer and gravity meter. Navigation, by military standard GPS using the P code, had an accuracy of about 5 m. Detailed ship's tracks for the survey, from south to north, are shown in Figures 2-5.\n\nThe aims of the cruise were to determine the morphology and sea bed character of selected areas, to aid in tectonic, basin and sedimentological studies, to aid the fishing industry, and to provide critical information for future seismic profiling and geological sampling. Satellite gravity images, and sparse bathymetric and seismic profiles, were used to plan the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU beef industry, world biofuel policies and the South American wine industry. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 6.1 per cent to around $60.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 4.2 per cent increase to $56.7 billion in 2015-16. At this forecast level the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 16 per cent higher than the average of $52 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to decrease by 2.2 per cent to $28.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 14.7 per cent to $31.7 billion in 2016-17. This reflects forecast increases in the gross value of horticulture and cotton production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to increase by 6.7 per cent to $47.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.4 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.6 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2016-17 are wheat (up 25 per cent), wool (3 per cent), sugar (23 per cent), wine (3 per cent), barley (15 per cent), cotton (56 per cent), chickpeas (74 per cent), lamb (4 per cent), canola (33 per cent) and rock lobster (6 per cent). \r\n• The forecast increases in export earnings are expected to be partly offset by forecast falls in beef and veal (down 17 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (17 per cent) and mutton (12 per cent). Export earnings for dairy products are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 3.4 per cent to $1.6 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7.1 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US75 cents in 2016-17, slightly higher than the average of US73 cents in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU beef industry  \r\n• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers and importers of beef. Access to the EU market is controlled by strict animal health requirements and various quotas, which limit the amount of beef that can be imported. \r\n• As the European Union is a high value market for beef, improved access for Australia from a free trade agreement would likely lead to increased exports to this market. \r\n\r\n Oils ain't oils  \r\n• Biofuel policies in some of the world's largest biofuel producing economies have the potential to affect returns to Australian agricultural exports such as canola, sugar and coarse grains. \r\n• This article looks at recent developments in the world's leading biofuel producers and consumers (the United States, European Union and Brazil) and discusses the expected impact on world commodity prices in 2016-17 and the high-level implications for agricultural commodities in the medium term. \r\n South American wine industry  \r\n• South America is a major world producer and exporter of wine, accounting for almost 14 per cent of world production. Wine exports from South America have increased markedly in the past 15 years and its wine increasingly competes in Australia's major and emerging export markets. \r\n• This article focuses on the development of the Argentine and Chilean wine industries, with a focus on their competitiveness with Australian wine exports. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2014 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia conducted a marine seismic survey (GA-0352) over poorly defined areas of the Gippsland Basin between 5th of April to the 24th of April 2015. The aim was to acquire industry-standard precompetitive 2D seismic data, Multi-beam echo-sounder (MBES) and sub-bottom profiling (SBP) data to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the basin. The survey, undertaken as part of the Department of Industry and Science's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP), aimed to identify and characterise indicators of natural hydrocarbon or fluid seepage that may indicate compromised seal integrity in the region. The data collected during this survey will enhance sequence stratigraphic studies in the Gippsland Basin that provide constraints on the most suitable areas for storage of CO2 and help to identify potential CO2 storage reservoirs. The survey was conducted by Gardline CGG vessel MV Duke \nThe data collected during the survey are available for free download from the Geoscience Australia website.\nThis dataset include all the bathymetry data collected during the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Summary: \nA comprehensive NSW Land Tenure layer has been developed, integrating the latest and most reliable datasets sourced from various governmental authorities and departments. To the best of our knowledge, this layer offers detailed mapping of recent updates and changes in land tenure across the state. It includes information on land allocations, ownership transformations, and management updates, providing an up-to-date and accurate representation of land tenure in New South Wales.\nDescription: \nThe statewide Land Tenure layer is a comprehensive dataset created by incorporating spatial and aspatial data from various state and commonwealth government departments, organisations and authorities, including the Forestry Corporation of NSW; NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development; NSW Spatial Services; Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (Environment and Heritage); The Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (ABARES: SOFR23 &amp; SOFR18); the NSW SEED data portal; and National Park. \nThe wall-to-wall spatial feature class demonstrates how land in NSW is being managed or owned. It can also be employed to monitor changes in land management or ownership transfer over time.\nThe process of acquiring datasets for updating the tenure layer and creating the statewide layer began in January 2024 and continued until August 2024. The collected datasets were amalgamated, and gaps were filled. This combined layer has then been manually assessed and visually compared against various datasets to ensure its completeness and accuracy. Esri basemaps such as Imagery, Imagery Hybrid, OpenStreetMap, and Google Earth maps were also used for visual assessment. Furtheremore, expert knowledge from government professionals, and land history web search were considered to address potential inaccuracies and unreliability in datasets from various sources.\nThe land tenure data consists of seven Tenure classes each class covering various tenure types as below: \n    - Tenure Class: presents tenure classification of the dataset as Crownland-Leasehold; Crownland-Other; Indigenous Owned; National Park; Private; State Forest; Unresolved Tenure.\nTenure Type of each tenure class are as follow:    Crownland-Leasehold: Crown Timberland Lease; LEASE (SOFR2023); Leasehold Crown Land; Western Lands Lease;      Crownland-Other: Crown Road; Crown Waterway; Either Crown Waterway, Road or other; OCL (SOFR2023); Other crownland; Public Road; Reserved Crown Timber Land; Timber Reserve; Vacant And Reserved Crown Land; Vacant Crown Land; Reserve for Public Buildings (Forestry);      Indigenous Owned: Aboriginal Area;     National Park: Conservation Reserve; Fire trail within national parks; Historic Sites; National Park; Nature Reserve; NCR (SOFR2023); Regional Park; State Conservation Area;     Private: Hardwood Joint Venture; PRIV (SOFR2023); Private; Hardwood Plantations; Private Property; Private Softwood Plantation; Profit á Prendre; Softwood Joint Venture;     State Forest: FCNSW Ownership; MUF (SOFR2023); State Forest: State Forest OEH Managed Flora Reserve;     Unresolved Tenure: null (-2); ND (SOFR2023).\n    - Shape_Area: Area of each Tenure class in  square meter.\n    Caveats: \n    - In general, data from diverse sources retains different levels of accuracy, reliability and coverage, therefore, a thorough visual assessment has been carried out to overcome the issue. Having said that, there still could be potential minor errors which could have been missed due to the large extent of the dataset. \n    - Note that Roads, Waterways and general public areas across the Greater Sydney and Wollongong have not been properly mapped in this version. This will be updated in the next update.",

The loess filter used to create CARS2000 resolves at each point a mean value and a sinusoid with 1 year period (and in some cases a 6 month period sinusoid - the \"semi-annual cycle\".) The provided \"annual amplitude\" is simply the magnitude of that annual sinusoid. CARS is a set of seasonal maps of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, generated using Loess mapping from all available oceanographic data in the region. It covers the region 100-200E, 50-0S, on a 0.5 degree grid, and on 56 standard depth levels. Higher resolution versions are also available for the Australian continental shelf. The data was obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 98 and CSIRO Marine and NIWA archives. It was designed to improve on the Levitus WOA98 Atlas, in the Australian region. CARS2000 is derived from ocean cast data, which is always measured above the sea floor. However, for properties which do not change rapidly near the sea floor, this would not lead to a significant error. All the limitations of CARS2000 also apply here.",

    "description": "This feature class is to record all current and future public land owned by Launceston City Council. As determined by the legislation and council decisions.\r\n\r\nLocal Government Act 1993\r\n177A. Public land\r\n\r\n(1)The following land owned by a council is public land:\r\n(a)a public pier or public jetty;\r\n(b)any land that provides health, recreation, amusement or sporting facilities for public use;\r\n(c)any public park or garden;\r\n(d)any land acquired under section 176for the purpose of establishing or extending public land;\r\n(e)any land shown on a subdivision plan as public open space that is acquired by a council under the Local Government (Building and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1993;\r\n(f)any other land that the council determines is public land;\r\n(g)any other prescribed land or class of land.\r\n\r\n(2)The general manager is to –\r\n(a)keep lists or maps of all public land within the municipal area; and\r\n(b)make the lists and maps available for public inspection at any time during normal business hours.\r\n\r\nThis is any land we have classified as \"open space\" or \"for recreational purposes\" or other wording to the same effect on the Sealed Plan. It is important to note that the plan must be sealed. On top of this the parcel must have been transferred to council, which you can tell from the folio text. That's why these fields have been included: Sealed Plan, Plan Notation and Transfer Date. If all three fields are populated the land parcel does not need a council decision. Note: \"for drainage purposes\" does not suffice.\r\n\r\nIn situations where there is no sealed plan or the sealed plan doesn't contain wording as described, there must be a council decision for it to become part of the public land list. For this the fields: council decision date and agenda item are provided. There are two fields for agenda item as some area were part approved in one item with the rest in another.\r\n\r\nDirection was given by the Property Coordinator in the creation of this layer.\r\n\r\nThis layer follows cadastral boundaries where they are accurate. Where they are not, it follows the area boundary. We have excluded roads from the layer. Some areas are not whole of title. Proposed public lend is included. This has not been approved by council and does not fall into the other category described above.",

The amendment process is regulated by the Planning and Development Act 2005.\n\nAn amendment is advertised inviting submissions before a final decision on a proposal is made. A submission is a chance for people to express their opinion and provide information. The number of submissions received for or against a proposal will not determine the result, rather it is the reasoned argument of why a particular thing should or should not be done.\n\nSubmissions assist the WAPC in reviewing planning proposals before proceeding.

    "description": "This dataset contains historical readings for soil sensors within parks across the City of Melbourne. The sensors take a variety of readings such as salinity, temperature and moisture. The units and readings are included within the data. This dataset can be joined to the <a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/soil-sensor-locations/information/\">soil sensor locations</a> dataset using the site id column. This dataset contains a large number of records, to download only a particular sensor's readings see our attached <a href=\"https://help.opendatasoft.com/platform/en/exploring_catalog_and_datasets/02_looking_up_a_dataset/filtering_dataset.html\">guide on how to filter data</a>.\n\n📎 Note: An attachment  file is available for download that contains the complete historical data for 2023.\n\nDifferent readings taken (based on unit column):- %VWC: Volumetric water content is a numerical measure of soil moisture. It is simply the ratio of water volume to soil volume.- ºC: Temperature in degrees celsius.- µS/cm: Salinity is the measure of the concentration of dissolved (soluble) salts in water from all sources. (microseimens per centimetre)Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every hour as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.",

    "description": "We propose to monitor the bursts from the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst FRB 20240619D over six months using the Murriyang UWL receiver. The primary aim is to study the evolution of burst activity and polarization properties with frequency and time, and to discover any potential periodicity in the burst activity. These insights will enhance our understanding of the progenitor, emission physics, and the immediate magneto-ionic environment of FRB 20240619D, thereby informing the general FRB population. A total of 15 hours of observing between August and November 2024 resulted in over 1300 bursts detected using the UWL receiver. Some bursts exhibit complex spectro-temporal emission patterns. The burst rate, based on Murriyang and MeerKAT observations, indicates that the source was active until September 2nd, after which it became inactive. Given that two other repeating FRBs have exhibited periodic activity cycles, it is reasonable to expect that FRB 20240619D could become active again, making continued monitoring crucial. The UWL receiver's broad frequency coverage and sensitivity are essential for detecting many bursts and enabling simultaneous observations at different frequencies. This is important for understanding the burst activity evolution with time and frequency, spectral properties, and underlying emission mechanisms. The combination of sensitivity and wide bandwidth makes Murriyang the ideal telescope for monitoring this FRB. Results from these observations will be pivotal in understanding FRB 20240619D's place within the broader repeater population and its potential connection to broader FRB progenitor models.",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Sydney Metropolitan catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

It has been derived from data published in the Australian National Tide Tables.\n\nCAMRIS, standing for the Coastal and Marine Resources Information System, is a small-scale spatial analysis system developed in collaboration by several divisions of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), as part of the CSIRO Coastal Zone Program.  CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology is the custodian of the 'coastal' subset of the Australian Resources Information System (ARIS).  Coastal ARIS became the core dataset of the CAMRIS project.  The Coastal ARIS database was developed from a coastal inventory developed by Galloway et al.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who reported they were covered by private health insurance in the preceding 12 months, by Primary Health Network (PHN) area. The data spans the years of 2015-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "In March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs) began reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures to APRA in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of the data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APRA ceased the RFC data collection after September 2010.\r\n\r\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the BIS Guide on International Financial Statistics (see http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf; Part II International banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other countries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\r\n\r\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\r\n\r\nThis statistical table contains two data worksheets - one presenting data expressed in Australian dollar (AUD) terms and the other in USD terms.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the role of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international capital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country risk exposure of national banking systems. Only consolidated data are reported in this statistical table.\r\n\r\n‘Total banks and RFCs’ is also reported in USD equivalent amounts, using the end-quarter AUD/USD exchange rate from statistical table F11. \r\n\r\nThe consolidated data reported in this statistical table are on the international exposures of banks (and RFCs between March 2003 and September 2010) operating in Australia. The types of assets included here are consistent with the locational data in statistical table B12.1. However, the consolidated data differ from the locational data in three key ways: foreign currency positions with Australian residents are excluded (whereas they are included in the locational data); claims between different offices of the same institution (e.g. between the head office and its subsidiary) are netted (whereas positions, including intra-group positions, are reported on a gross basis in the locational data); and on-balance sheet derivatives are not included in international claims or foreign claims, but are included separately under ‘Derivatives’ in statistical table B13.2. Foreign-owned reporting entities report on an unconsolidated basis.\r\n\r\nThe consolidated data are split by type of exposure. ‘International claims’ refers to all cross-border claims plus foreign offices’ local claims on residents in foreign currencies; foreign claims refers to all cross-border claims plus foreign offices’ local claims on residents in both local and foreign currencies; immediate risk claims (expressed by the BIS as claims on an immediate borrower basis) cover claims based on the country where the immediate counterparty resides; and ultimate risk claims cover immediate exposures adjusted (via guarantees and other risk transfers) to reflect the location of the ultimate counterparty/risk.\r\n\r\nForeign offices include the overseas branches, subsidiaries and joint ventures of a bank (or RFC between March 2003 and September 2010).\r\n\r\nRisk transfers are those transfers of risk from the country of the immediate borrower to the country of ultimate risk as a result of guarantees, collateral, and where the counterparty is a legally dependent branch of a bank headquartered in another country. The risk reallocation includes loans to Australian borrowers that are guaranteed by foreign entities and therefore represent outward risk transfers from Australia, which increase the ultimate exposure to the country of the guarantor. Similarly, foreign lending that is guaranteed by Australian entities is reported as an inward risk transfer to Australia, which reduces the ultimate exposure to the country of the foreign borrower. The risk reallocation also includes transfers between different economic sectors (banks, public sector and non-bank private sector) in the same country. \r\n\r\nForeign claims on an ultimate risk basis are shown for the following types of reporting entity: Australian-owned banks (i.e. those with their parent entity legally incorporated in Australia); foreign subsidiary banks; branches of foreign banks; RFCs; and Australian-owned entities (i.e. Australian-owned banks and RFCs). The RFC data are only available between March 2003 and September 2010.\r\n\r\n‘Foreign claims (ultimate risk basis) – Aust-owned entities’ is also reported in USD equivalent amounts, using the end-quarter AUD/USD exchange rate from statistical table F11.\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset comprises mapping associated with the State Planning Policy 2.4 Basic Raw Materials (BRM). Significant Geological Supplies (SGS) are those BRM areas identified by the DMIRS as having State significance due to the size of the resource, relative scarcity, demand and/or location near growth areas and transport routes. Most SGS areas are derived from, and therefore are a subset of, DMIRS published Regionally Significant Basic Raw Material mapping. Where this is not the case, they are derived using the same rule set as for the Regionally Significant Basic Raw Material mapping. Within the Perth and Peel Region, the SGS areas were further refined by an extensive interagency BRM planning process, which included public consultation in 2015. In the Perth and Peel Region, the SGS areas took into account environmental values, current and future land uses, including sequential land use opportunities, current and future infrastructure and BRM supply and demand considerations. BRM types shown are the dominant surface materials, but the application of the policy is not restricted to those materials. For example, a SGS area designated as ‘Sand’ may include limestone and gravel and the policy applies to all BRM derived from within those areas. The designation of an SGS area does not obligate a private landowner or State agency to extract these resources, nor does it presume that extraction would be environmentally acceptable or that subsequent approvals for extraction or environmental approvals are guaranteed. Planning policy associated with this mapping is documented in the State Planning Policy 2.4.",

The 1 ha plot was established in 2015. Preliminary images have been captured since 2000 using various sampling strategies and protocols. The overstorey is dominated by <em>Eucalyptus delegatensis</em> and <em>Eucalyptus dalrympleana</em>. For additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/tumbarumba-wet-eucalypt-supersite/.\n\nOther images collected at the site include digital cover photography, phenocam time-lapse images taken from fixed under and overstorey cameras, and ancillary images of fauna and flora.",

    "title": "Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan Report Cessnock City (Black Creek) - Report",
    "description": "Cessnock City Council has engaged Cardno (NSW/ACT) Pty Ltd to prepare the Black Creek Floodplain Risk Management Study and the Black Creek Floodplain Risk Management Plan in accordance with the NSW Government Floodplain Development Manual (NSW Government, 2005). Flooding in the catchment can pose a hazard to residents and businesses near the creeks, channels and overland flow paths.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to identify and examine options for the management of flooding within the Black Creek catchment.\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to document a strategy of suitable actions for implementation. The Black Creek catchment is located within the Cessnock Local Government Area (LGA) and comprises all urban areas including the Cessnock Central Business District (CBD) and surrounding suburbs. Black Creek has several tributaries, including Bellbird Creek, Lavender Creek, Limestone Creek, Kearsley Creek and Aberdare Creek. Other tributaries include the Oliver Street channel in South Cessnock and the East Cessnock Drain. These tributaries flow through rural areas towards Cessnock and generally comprise concrete lined trapezoidal channels in the urban areas. Given the numerous creeks converging in Cessnock, flooding has occurred regularly including in 1949, 1977, 1990, 1992 and 2007.\n\nAs part of this study, the existing hydrological and hydraulic models developed as part of the Black Creek Flood Study (DHI, 2010) were extended to include areas outside of the Cessnock CBD where limited information on flooding behaviour existed including Bellbird, Mount View detention basin and surrounds and northeast of the CBD. Up-to-date ground survey information was collected in 2011 and was used to represent the terrain in the hydraulic model. Flood modelling was undertaken for seven design storm events ranging from the 20% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) event up to the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event in order to assess flood behaviour in the extended hydraulic model.\n\nA number of key differences from the DHI (2010) study resulted from the extension of the hydraulic model and incorporation of up-to-date survey information including a reduction in 1% AEP flood levels ranging from 0.2m to 0.5m along Bellbird Creek and a reduction in flood levels of 0.2m along East Cessnock Drain. The updated hydraulic model provides detailed information on flood behaviour and overland flow paths in the vicinity of Mount View detention basin and through the urban areas of Cessnock. The revised flood extents were adopted by Council in March 2014.\n\nAn assessment was undertaken on the number of properties that would be subject to overground and overfloor flooding within the floodplain under various design storm events ranging from the 20% AEP event up to the PMF.  \n\nOptions to reduce or manage the effects of flooding in the catchment were investigated to manage the risks of flooding. Under the merits-based approach outlined in the NSW State Government’s Floodplain Development Manual (NSW Government, 2005) a number of potential options for the management of flooding were identified, namely:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFlood modification measures (FM Options);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nProperty modification measures (P Options); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nEmergency response modification measures (EM Options).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nAn extensive list of options was assessed against a range of criteria (technical, economic, environmental and social) and hydraulic modelling of some of the flood mitigation options was undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of those options that would involve significant capital expenditure.\n\nThe highest ranking options identified by the multi criteria analysis include:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nFM5, proposed bund/flood wall east of Sixth Street properties and railway line in South Cessnock;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nEM4, Public awareness and education;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nEM5, Flood warning signs at critical locations;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nP6, Land Swap;\n</li>\n<li>\n\nP3, House Raising; \n</li>\n<li>\n\nP4, House Rebuilding;\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nA number of structural options assessed were not considered viable either due to:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nadverse impacts on flood levels such as Option FM2 (A combination of a detention basin, a bund and channel reshaping along Bellbird Creek); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nwhere the cost benefit ratio indicated the cost of implementing the option were much higher than the resultant reduction in flood damages, including:\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM1 (Combination of detention basins along Black Creek);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM3 (A combination of channel widening, channel reshaping and culvert upgrades on Black Creek);\n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM4 (Channel widening of the existing Oliver Street channel at South Cessnock); \n</li>\n<li>\n\nOption FM6 (Detention Basin at Austar Coal Mine Site on Bellbird Creek upstream).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe ranking is used as the basis for prioritising the components of the Floodplain Risk Management Plan  It is noted that scoring adopted is not absolute and the proposed scoring and weightings used should be reviewed in future.\n\nThe Floodplain Risk Management Plan (Chapter 15) represents the proposed implementation plan of actions for the management of flood risks in the Black Creek Floodplain. The action list contains a mix of approaches to managing flood risks with a priority system of high, medium and low for implementation of the actions.",

This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2018-19 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night). \r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2018-19 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV__\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV.

Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).\r\nDifferences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts. \r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2017-18\r\n* 2018-19\r\n* 2019-20\r\n* 2020-21\r\n* 2021-22\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture and Water Resources Portfolio\r\n* Attorney-General’s Portfolio\r\n* Communications and the Arts Portfolio\r\n* Defence Portfolio\r\n* Defence Portfolio (Department of Veterans’ Affairs)\r\n* Education and Training Portfolio\r\n* Environment and Energy Portfolio\r\n* Finance Portfolio\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio\r\n* Health Portfolio\r\n* Department of Human Services\r\n* Home Affairs Portfolio\r\n* Human Services\r\n* Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities Portfolio\r\n* Jobs and Innovation Portfolio (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science)\r\n* Jobs and Innovation Portfolio (Department of Jobs and Small Business)\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio\r\n* Social Services Portfolio\r\n* Treasury Portfolio\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nBudget Paper Tables\r\nThe list below shows the data tables from the Budget Papers which are available in Excel and CSV formats.\r\n\r\n* Overview Glossy - Appendix C - Major Initiatives\r\n* Overview Glossy - Appendix D - Major Savings\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 3 - Table 6 - Reconciliation of underlying cash balance estimates\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 5 - Table 1 - Australian Government general government receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 5 - Table 7 - Australian Government general government (cash) receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 5 - Table 10 - Reconciliation of 2018-19 general government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 5 - Online tables 1 to 4, Australian Government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 6 - Table A1 - Estimates of expenses by function and sub-function\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 11 - Table 1 - Australian Government general government sector receipts payments net Future Fund earning and underlying cash balance\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 11 - Table 3 - Australian Government general government sector taxation receipts non taxation receipts and total receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 11 - Table 3 - Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 1.1 - Agency Resourcing\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 1.2 - Special Appropriations\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 1.3 - Special Accounts\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 2.2 - Staffing Tables\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 3.1 - Departmental Expenses\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 3.2 - Net Capital Investment\r\n\r\nA dedicated web-page has been created on data.gov.au for the 2017-18 Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements (PSAES) dataset.",

    "description": "The activity of Mount Lamington over the last half year has tended to confirm conclusions drawn from earlier observations, namely, that conditions of slow decline in overall activity pointed towards a return to the dormant state. There have been fluctuations in activity during this period, renewed dome building in some sectors of the crater and on one occasion, explosions were reported to have occurred near the dome summit.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

The type of meadow (continuous or patchy), epiphytic cover on seagrass (as none, very low, low, medium, high or very high), and macroalgae cover (as percentage cover in categories: 0, &lt;15%, 15-45%, 45-75%, &gt;75%) were recorded at each site. At approximately a third of the sites, physical \nwater profiles, secchi depth and photosynthetically active radiation (euphotic depth) were recorded. When observation locations were inaccessible by boat, sites were accessed from kayaks to make observations. \n\nThe datasets making up the seagrass survey data are:\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass - point dataset\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Extent - polygon showing presence/absence\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Cover - polygon showing % cover\n\nLayers:\n\n<code>PrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Jan_2021 \n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass points where Year = '2021'\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Extent_Jan_2021\n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass_Extent where Year = '2021'\n\nPrincessRoyal_Seagrass_Cover_Jan_2021\n    - PrincessRoyal_seagrass_cover points where Year = '2021'\n</code>",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2005.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS062008.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, New South Wales, April 16, 2008\nArrived:  \tNoumea, New Caledonia, April 29, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2016 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Geoscience Australia has been updating its collection of navigation for marine seismic surveys in Australia. These include original navigation files, the 2003 SNIP navigation files and digitised survey track maps. The result will be an updated cleansed navigation collection.\n\nThe collection is based on the SNIP format P190 navigation file which follows the UKOOA standard. Industry standard metadata associated with a seismic survey is preserved.\n\nTo assist industry, Geoscience Australia is making available its updated version of cleansed navigation. Although the process of updating the navigation data is ongoing and there is still legacy data to check, the navigation data is at a point where a significant improvement has been achieved and it is now usable. Users should be aware that this navigation is not final and there may be errors. Geoscience Australia (email - AusGeodata@ga.gov.au) appreciates being notified of any errors found.\n\n The data is available in both KML and Shape file formats.\n\nThe KML file can be viewed using a range of applications including Google Earth, NASA WorldWind, ESRI ArcGIS Explorer, Adobe PhotoShop, AutoCAD3D or any other earth browser (geobrowser) that accepts KML formatted data.\n\nAlternatively the Shape files can be downloaded and viewed using any application that supports shape files.\n\nDisclaimer: Geoscience Australia gives no warranty regarding the data downloads provided herein nor the data's accuracy, completeness, currency or suitability for any particular purpose.

By investigating the properties and components of this core we are able to reveal some information about this hemi-pelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. Information obtained or inferred from the core include the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon through time, an age vs. depth profile, the percentage of grainsize fractions throughout the core and the percentage of carbonate material in each sample. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses were also run on several samples from each core to determine changes in the carbonate mineralogy and terrestrial influx, which provided further palaeoclimatic information.",

    "description": "Fiddler crabs are often spectacularly coloured and capable of dramatic colour changes. While the adaptive significance of variation resulting from short- or long-term colour changes is generally well known, the phenotypic diversity in colour pattern between individuals is often neglected. To fully understand the development and function of colour pattern variation, it is necessary to first describe its morphological basis and the naturally occurring diversity. - NB Colour pattern refers to the configuration of any coloured areas on the black carapace, regardless of their spectral composition. \n\nDuring this experiment 276 fiddler crabs of the species Uca capricornis were photographed - 117 females and 159 males. Using these pictures and a host of software programs, images were constructed that illustrate the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs, including males and females in general, and males and females with various size classes; <8mm, 8-9.9mm, 10-11.9mm, 12-13.9mm, 14-15.9mm, 16-17.9mm, and males >18mm (no photographed females were >18mm).   These images are the equivalent of an average crab's colour pattern. \n\nTo more clearly illustrate the variation in colour pattern between the groups, similar images were constructed using the standard deviation of crabs coloured at each coordinate (1mm x 1mm square).",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "title": "ACNC 2015 Annual Information Statement Data",
    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Generally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. This dataset provides a record of the 2015 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for a charity’s 2015 reporting year. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2014 – 30 June 2015, for others it will be the 2015 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset. There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information: \r\n\r\n• is commercially sensitive and it could cause harm \r\n\r\n• is false, confusing or misleading \r\n\r\n• is offensive \r\n\r\n• could endanger public safety \r\n\r\n• falls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund). \r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](acnc.gov.au/findacharity). \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2015 reporting period. \r\n\r\nSome charities report to the ACNC as part of a reporting group. The 2015 AIS information for these charities is attached as a separate dataset on this page. Any analysis of AIS data should include those charities as well.  \r\n\r\nThe 2015 AIS collects information about charity finances. Financial information provides a basis for understanding the charity and its activities in greater detail. However, it is easy to misunderstand a charity's financial position or performance by judging it solely on its financial information. When comparing financial information to other charities, it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is especially the case for small charities, that do not provide financial reports which often contain more details about a charity's financial position and activities. For more information on interpreting financial information, please see the [ACNC website](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/About_Register/financial_info/ACNC/Reg/understanding_financial.aspx). \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a network of researchers who are interested in the sector, and hold regular teleconferences. If you are interested in becoming involved in the Research network, please [email us](research@acnc.gov.au). The ACNC also publishes other datasets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the explanatory notes attached to help with analysis of this dataset.",

This means, in ACT-wide cat containment areas, cats born on or after 1 July 2022 must be kept on your premises 24 hours a day. \n\nA number of suburbs across the ACT have been declared cat containment areas under the Domestic Animals (Cat Containment) Declaration 2019 (No 1) - Disallowable Instrument DI2019-33. This means  in these suburbs that were declared cat containment areas, all cats (regardless of age) must be contained to their premises 24 hours a day.\n\nThis is a non-asset dataset for information only. The polygons are managed by City Services, City and Environment Directorate (CED).\n\nAttributes include area name, division and declaration (ACT-wide cat containment area, declared cat containment area).\n\nFor additional information, please see relevant details below\n- ACT Government City Services website (https://www.cityservices.act.gov.au/pets-and-wildlife/domestic-animals/cats/cat-containment)\n- Domestic Animals Act 2000 (https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/2000-86/current/html/2000-86.html)\n- Domestic Animals (Cat Containment) Declaration 2019 (No1) - Disallowable Instrument DI2019-33 (https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/di/2019-33/current/html/2019-33.html)\n\n\n",

    "description": "The 2020-21 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2020-21 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n*\tPBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n*\tSelected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2020-21 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n*\tTable 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n*\tTable 1.2: Entity 2020-21 Budget Measures;\r\n*\tTable 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n*\tTable 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n*\tTable 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n*\tTables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2020-21 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n*\tPortfolio\r\n*\tDepartment/Entity\r\n*\tOutcome\r\n*\tProgram\r\n*\tExpense type\r\n*\tAppropriation type\r\n*\tDescription\r\n*\t2019-20\r\n*\t2020-21\r\n*\t2021-22\r\n*\t2022-23\r\n*\t2023-24\r\n*\tSource document\r\n*\tSource table\r\n*\tURL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n*\tAgriculture, Water and the Environment\r\n*\tAttorney-General's\r\n*\tDefence\r\n*\tEducation, Skills and Employment\r\n*\tFinance\r\n*\tForeign Affairs and Trade\r\n*\tHealth\r\n*\tHome Affairs\r\n*\tIndustry, Science, Energy and Resources\r\n*\tInfrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications\r\n*\tPrime Minister and Cabinet\r\n*\tSocial Services\r\n*\tTreasury\r\n*\tVeterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n*\tDepartment of the House of Representatives\r\n*\tDepartment of the Senate\r\n*\tDepartment of Parliamentary Services\r\n*\tParliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both _Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook_ and _Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing_ are included for reference as well.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of employed optometrists and full-time equivalent (FTE) per 100,000 population. The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWD). The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), in conjunction with the national health professional registration boards, is responsible for the national registration process for 14 health professions. The data from the annual registration process, together with data from a workforce survey that is voluntarily completed at the time of registration, form the Department of Health’s National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWDS). Data in the NHWDS includes demographic and employment information (for example, labour force status, location of main job, area of practice, work setting) for registered health professionals. In this report, the data on optometrists and ophthalmologists comes from the NHWDS as reported by AIHW.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nFTE is a measure calculated by dividing an estimate of the total hours worked by employees in an occupation in a week by an estimate of the standard hours worked for optometrists (38 hours per week). The number of FTE is then compared with the size of relevant population to get the FTE 100,000 population.\n\n",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘h_vulnerability.shp’ contains polygon data indicating the approximate boundary of the basal aquifer that is at high risk from water contamination and over extraction.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behaviour on the island.  The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the high vulnerability boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

Includes description, asset section (for As Constructed drawings) and key attributes. This layer is intended to help identify the location of Melbourne Water's drainage assets for asset management and maintenance purposes.\n\n\n\nWaterway (Reach) layer created from original FIS 1:50K (Vicmap Hydro) streams data set which included only those waterways within catchments of greater than 60ha. Waterways (Reach) Rectification project undertaken 2001 to 2003 to review and correct the extent of the waterways reach network to ensure a complete data set exists (using the Drainage Metropolis Boundary, 50K data, 1:2500 Drainage Record Plans, Drainage Limits data, orthophotos, as constructed and/or design drawings, contour data and Melway Street Directory). Waterway (Reach) extents defined and attributes populated in GIS and Hansen (AMIS) for all records including assigning nodes and node numbers (for start / end points) and removing any reaches less than 100 metres in length that are predominantly channel assets. Waterways in extended area incorporated in 2005 using Vicmap Hydro data and aerial imagery, then updated in 2009/10 using Lidar survey data (contours). Data is maintained using Lidar survey data (contours) and 60 ha limits. Please refer to metadata for each record in dataset for specific source / accuracy information.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "\n\n\n<strong>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</strong>\nRiver and Creek Flooding\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside.&nbsp;\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i>&nbsp;Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions&nbsp;- with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage.&nbsp;\n<i>Purpose</i>:&nbsp;To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure&nbsp;with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach&nbsp;based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations.&nbsp;<i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i>&nbsp;\n<i>Flood Height:&nbsp;</i>Indicates the approximate water surface level of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event, expressed in metres above mean sea level. This dataset represents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of 0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i>&nbsp;The dataset includes three possible flood events of different probability.\n<i>Likelihood: Likely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood:&nbsp;Possible</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):&nbsp;1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):&nbsp;100 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood: Unlikely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year</i>\n<i>Version Notes&nbsp;3.1.0</i>&nbsp;- First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE. (October 2023)\n<i>Version Resolution: 2.5m</i>\n<i>Data Reliability: A&nbsp;</i>\n<i>Indicates the flood data is of the highest available standard and has been prepared using the most recent flood model and input data&nbsp;</i>\n<i>Further Information:&nbsp;</i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding</a>\n<strong>Moreton Bay Regional Floodplain Database</strong>\nOverland Flow Flooding\n<i>Version 1.25.0 (April 2025)</i>\n&nbsp;\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;'Rainfall on grid' approach applied using a hydraulic model (TUFLOW) and a nested rainfall burst. Model does not include underground structures however rainfall was scaled down to account for the possibility of some run-off being contained within the underground system. A post-process was applied to eliminate areas of shallow depth, low velocity and low velocity depth product. Additional removal of model errors and small property intersects using spatial analysis and manual techniques.<i>Existing Conditions Scenario:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Modelled estimate of the extent of overland flow paths following a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability storm outside the river and creek flood extent and with some model errors and small property intersects removed.<i>Purpose:</i>&nbsp;To determine flood extent along overland flowpaths in areas outside the extent of the river and creek flood modelling. Suitable for public dissemination.<i>Flood Extent:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indicates the approximate extent of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event (not actual recorded levels). The inundation area may be less accurate where the property is flat near the outer limit of inundation, or where the ground surface has been modified since being surveyed.This dataset represents the flood extent as vector polygons without attribution.<i>Modelled Probability:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is:&nbsp;1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year<i>Likelihood:</i>&nbsp;Possible<i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):</i>&nbsp;1%<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):</i>&nbsp;100 YearA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but neverthess still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.<i>Version Notes&nbsp;1.25.0 - Sub set of F01 Version 1.24 with areas removed where field Public = N in F00N Version 1.18.8 (April 2025)</i><i>Version Resolution: 1.0m</i><i>Data Reliability: D</i><i>Indicates that Council can only provide an extent but not levels as the flood data is of limited reliability</i>\n<i><strong>Further Information</strong></i><i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website </i><a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">Flood information for residents of Moreton Bay - City of Moreton Bay</a>",

    "description": "Land capability for perennial horticulture in the south west of Western Australia based on analysis and interpretation of the best available soil-landscape mapping dataset (DPIRD-027).\n\nThe assessment for perennial horticulture covers production of irrigated horticultural crops on plants with long life-cycles (typically trees, shrubs or woody vines). Included are orchard crops (e.g. apples, citrus, stone fruit, avocados, nuts, etc.) and vineyard crops (e.g. grapes and kiwifruit). Although the plants are perennial, crops are harvested annually. \n\nThe assumptions for the land use as assessed include: \n• crops are grown for commercial production \n• plants are deep-rooted with roots typically extending to depths of 100 cm or more \n• plants are irrigated using drip, micro-jet or mini-sprinkler systems \n• fertilisers and herbicides, fungicides and/or pesticides are broadcast at least annually \n• mechanised cultivation occurs only during crop establishment \n• weeds are controlled by mowing, slashing or sprays \n• machinery access to the crop is required for spraying, pruning and/or harvesting \n• considers physical requirements only and ignores socio-economic factors.\n\nLand capability refers to the ability of land to support a type of land use without causing damage. \n\nSee DAFWA Resource Management Technical Report 298 for a description of the qualities assessed and the methodology involved.\n\nCapability ratings do not take into account factors such as the availability and quality of water supplies for irrigation or climatic risks such as frost or heat stress. Such factors need to be considered as a separate layer of information.",

Forty dynamometers (20 in each zone) were deployed on each sampling occasion and left out for 2 tidal cycles (approx. 24 hours). The maximum force that was exerted on the dynamometer within this period was recorded on a spring scale. The force exerted by the waves was directly proportional to water velocity.",

The LRA dataset identifies land that is to be acquired for a public purpose. The dataset identifies the purpose for which the land is to be acquired and the relevant authority. Public purposes can include roads, recreational and open spaces and national parks.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset.\n The Land Application data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB.\n The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended.

    "description": "\nThis layer contains information on the distribution and vegetation types of High Country Sphagnum Bogs and Fens in the ACT as defined by Nature Conservation (High Country Bogs and Associated Fens) Conservation Advice 2019 (Nature Conservation Act). The dataset includes areas of RAMSAR significance. The threatened Northern Corroboree Frogs are also associated with these ecosystems. Veg mapping was undertaken by Geoff Hope et al in 2009 and later revisited during mapping of ACT Vegetation Communities in 2015-2018 (Baines et al 2018).\nThe ACT Scientific Committee determined that the ecological community High Country Bogs and Associated Fens is eligible for inclusion in the ACT Threatened Ecological Communities List in 2019. Most ACT High Country Bogs and Associated Fens communities are consistent with the nationally listed Alpine Sphagnum Bogs and Associated Fens ecological community.\nThe mountains of the Australian Capital Territory support substantial areas of peat-forming mires in interfluves and valley heads, as well as areas of riparian fen vegetation along streams. While similar fens and bogs occur in the Snowy Mountains, the ACT represents a significant outlier of major biogeographic significance because the mires are near their climatic limits and hence sensitive to climate change.\nMapping of the mires was originally completed by Hope et al 2009. The mapping was developed in three stages using orthorectified aerial photography and satellite imagery and extensive field checking. More information can be found at: Hope, G., Nanson, R. and Flett, I. 2009. Technical Report 19. The peat-forming mires of the Australian Capital Territory. Territory and Municipal Services, Canberra. <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2539595/19-peat-forming-mires-of-the-act-2009.pdf\">https://www.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2539595/19-peat-forming-mires-of-the-act-2009.pdf</a>\nKey plant communities of ACT Bogs and Fens (Armstrong et al. 2012):\n•   a2: Baeckea gunniana – Epacris paludosa – Richea continentis – Sphagnum cristatum Wet Heathland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Bog).\n•   a7: Ranunculus pimpinellifolius – Gonocarpus micranthus herbfield of wetland heathland of the Australian Alps bioregion (Bog).\n• a8: Carex gaudichaudiana – Myriophyllum pedunculatum – Deschampsia caespitosa Sedgeland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Fen).\n•   a9: Carex gaudichaudiana – Ranunculus amphitrichus – Phragmites australis Aquatic Herbfield of waterways in the Australian Alps and South-Eastern Highlands Bioregion (Montane Bogs and Fens).\nOther key plant communities (Hope et al. 2009):\n•   Empodisma minus restiad Fen.\n•   Phragmites – Typha tall sedgelands (Fen).\nAssociated plant communities (Armstrong et al. 2012):\n•  a14: Poa costiniana – Carex gaudichaudiana Subalpine Valley Grassland of the Australian Alps Bioregion (Alpine/subalpine Grasslands/Herbfields).\n•   e59: Hakea microcarpa – Baeckea utilis – Leptospermum myrtifolium Subalpine Wet Heathland on Escarpment and Eastern Tableland Ranges of the South-Eastern Highlands Bioregion.\n• u193: Hakea microcarpa – Epacris breviflora – Epacris paludosa Montane Wet Heathland of the Australian Alps and western South-Eastern Highlands Bioregions.\nNote this product includes some areas of a33 vegetation community, which is formally considered to be associated with the threatened community (see ACT High Country Bogs and Fens Action Plan 2024, ACT Government). However, these areas were originally mapped by Hope et al 2009 with high altitude sphagnum bog (HSB) present.\nFor more information on ACT High Country Bogs and Fens, visit <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens\">https://www.act.gov.au/environment/animals-and-plants/act-threatened-species/high-country-bogs-and-associated-fens</a>\nUpdates: Majority of the mapping was completed post 2003 fires. However, the dataset is was updated using Near Infrared Imagery 2015 and LiDAR data in 2019. Further updates will be implemented as required if new or better mapping of bog and fen areas become available.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:3,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for showing presence of bogs and fens in the ACT. Exact boundaries and extents will contract and expand throughout time. This should be considered if data use purpose requires accuracy of greater than 50m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors. © ACT Government",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2014 calendar year.\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 1,126,441 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either:  \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed.  \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2014 car parking event data there are 3,377 records where the parking event goes into 2015 and ends at midnight.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/t6hb-9uf2.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (1.56GB, 51.5 million rows)",

    "description": "A geological investigation of the Maranboy Tin Field was commenced by officers of the Bureau of Mineral Resources in May, 1951. The object of the survey is, primarily, to obtain a detailed preliminary assessment of the potential ore reserves of the field. Geological mapping and sampling of the major lode lines has been carried out in an attempt to determine the features which control ore deposition and to enable estimates to be prepared of the grade and tonnage of ore per vertical foot, which may be expected from these lode lines. The main emphasis of this work during the 1951 field season was on the major producing lines in what has been called the Southern Field, the Main Lode and part of the Stannum King lode. In addition to this programme, an area of approximately nine square miles was mapped in detail using aerial photographs. Approximately 1,000 square miles of the area surrounding Maranboy was mapped on a regional basis.\n\nThe history of the field, general geology, and the geology of the individual lodes are discussed in this report. The accompanying maps are enclosed.",

    "description": "This layer (Blackwood) is a statewide mapping layer produced by the Department of State Growth as part of the implementation of the Tasmanian Special Species Management Plan 2017. This layer represents an indication of areas likely to contain blackwood trees. It has been created by selecting a subset of TASVEG categories whose floristic descriptions include blackwood as either the dominant or a component species. The layer is intended for use in planning for harvest of special species timbers and is indicative only. It does not provide information on land tenure, forest age or suitability of trees for special species timber products. Special species timber harvesting should only occur on appropriate land tenures with landowner permission, and follow proper planning and regulatory processes as described in the Tasmanian Special Species Management Plan 2017.",

Project grids  provide a Transverse Mercator (TM) based standard for the interchange of data for  engineering, surveying and mapping projects. Within a project grid, the distance between two points on a plan will be the same as the ground distance to a defined tolerance of 20 parts per million (ppm).

    "description": "All designated neighbourhood government schools (referred to as a local school) have a school zone. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English language schools, selective entry high schools, or community schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nEvery Victorian student has the legislated right to enrol at their local government school. A school zone does not restrict a student’s choice to seek enrolment at other government schools. Students can enrol at a school outside their zone if the school has sufficient accommodation and it aligns with the school’s enrolment management implementation plan, where applicable.\nFor students residing in metropolitan Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the local school is usually the nearest government school in a straight line from the child’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is usually the nearest school by the shortest practical route, recognising the additional travel distances often experienced in regional settings.\nIt is recognised that some school zones need to be aligned with geographical and structural barriers that significantly impede direct school access such as rivers and freeways. A main road with pedestrian crossings, however, is not usually considered to be a barrier to accessing a school.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect new schools opening, changing provision at existing schools (e.g., relocating a campus or changing year levels offered), improving school accessibility, or managing enrolment demand.\nThe school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website. More information on Victorian school zones can found at https://www.vic.gov.au/school-zones.\nSchool zones have been produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. The location point for all government schools is taken from the department’s register of school locations. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset have been used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",
