The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2006.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "The Ombai deepwater mooring was first deployed on 2011-06-19 at (8.53 S, 125.09 E) in the Indonesian Throughflow.\n\nInstrumentation includes 150 kHz and 75kHz ADCPs, Seabird SBE39s, discrete current meters and Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES).\n\nThe mooring provides profile velocity data above 500m and point source velocity between 500m and 1200m (depth of controlling sill). Temperature and salinity data are collected for the entire water column.\n\nThe aim of IMOS Indonsian Throughflow moorings (Indoflow) is to sustainably and directly measure the leakage of Pacific thermocline and intermediate waters from the western equatorial Pacific into the South Indian Ocean. The Indonesian Passages represent an important 'choke point' of the global ocean overturning circulation and the climate system. The interannual to decadal variability of the size and depth distribution of the flow through this choke point remains a troublesome unknown. In particular, changes in this flow will reflect long term changes in the Pacific and Indian Ocean wind fields, particularly any change in the Walker Circulation, as predicted by coupled climate models forced by increasing Greenhouse Gas scenarios. Changes in the associated heat flux are also anticipated at the global oceans warm. The Indoflow array design is based on the more comprehensive INSTANT process study and is deemed the minimal required mooring array to monitor the Indonesian Throughflow. The Ombai Strait and Timor Passage Throughflow components comprise about 11Sv of the 14 Sv total interbasin exchange. The Indoflow array integrates with the AIMS NAOS shelf line, allowing estimates of the interbasin exchange to include the transport of very warm waters across the Australian North West Shelf. All moorings in the Timor Passage are located along a high precision swath line of the TOPEX/Jason satellite altimeter missions. These data will shed light on how best to exploit altimetric data over our shallow northern shelves, especially in data assimilating models.",

Assets managed and / or owned privately, by other ACT Government Directorates or by the Federal Government may not be included.\n\nThe dataset includes streetlight luminaires and/or streetlight columns (as some streetlights are mounted to electricity poles or other structures). Streetlights are external lights that illuminate the road network and/or open spaces at night time. There are a range of different styles, heights, lamp types and brightness of lights depending on the amount of light required. The asset numbers are physically mounted to each streetlight and they are determined by the suburb code and a sequential number. It is common practice for asset numbers to be reused when street lights are removed, replaced or relocated.\n\nAttributes include location description, suburb, ownership, maintained by, asset sub type (Streetlight Column And Luminaire, Streetlight Luminaire Only), column height and material, the number of lamps and outreach arms, luminaires and power type, the associated cable type and conduit, the status of the streetlight, when it was installed and the reference information for the source of the data. \n\nThese assets are captured and maintained in the TCCS asset database through the works as executed (WAE) handover process or field audits. The information available in this dataset may be incomplete and should not be solely relied upon as a search. No warranty is given in relation to the data (including accuracy, reliability, completeness or suitability) and no liability accepted (including without limitation, liability in negligence) for any loss damage or costs (including consequential damage) relating to any use of the data. Minor to substantial delays may occur in updating the source data to reflect as-constructed information. This data is generally used for the Dial Before You Dig (DBYD) service and should be used as a guide only.\n\nFor additional information, please see the relevant municipal infrastructure standard (https://www.cityservices.act.gov.au/plan-and-build/standards-codes-and-guidelines/municipal-infrastructure-design-standards-mis).",

    "description": "This report details the flood gauging operation undertaken on 30th April, 1988 and\npresents the data collected for the Georges River catchment, Sydney.\n\nThe Georges River catchment area is approximately 960 square kilometres and is\nshown in Figure 1.1. The main arm of the river begins its course near the Cataract\nDam, and exits into Botany Bay. The main channel is joined throughout its course\nby minor streams and creeks. The Woronora River catchment also drains into the\nGeorges River.\n\nThe catchment area comprises a large part of the south western urban area of the\ncity of Sydney, and the floods that have occurred in the catchment have at times\ncaused significant damage to property.\n\nTo rationalise future development of the area in the face of potential flood threats,\nvarious numerical and physical models have been developed by both the University\nof N.S.W. Water Research Laboratory, and the Public Works Department's Manly\nHydraulics Laboratory. The success of the models in predicting the flooding\ncharacteristics of various flood events depend upon collecting specific flood data\nover a series of floods for model calibration and verification. To this end, all known\ninformation regarding previous floods has been documented (Ref. 1 and 4), but\nthere is a need for more comprehensive flood data, especially for major floods.\n\nManly Hydraulics Laboratory (M.H.L.) was requested by the Department's Coast\nand Rivers (C&amp;R) Branch to co-ordinate and undertake flood monitoring at various\nsites over the area which is being modelled. These monitoring sites appear in Figure\n1.2. Previous reports (Ref. 1 and 4) detail the results of gauging of earlier floods\nundertaken in 1978, 1983 and 1986.\n\nFlood gauging on the 30th April, 1988 was carried out by personnel from the\nDepartment's M.H.L. and C&amp;R.\n\nThe general extent of the flooding 12 hours after the peak can be seen in Plates 1 4.\n\nThe current metering lines, flood gauge locations and automatic recorder locations\nfrom which data was collected are as follows:\ni) Current metering/gauge observations at:\n<ol>\n<li>East Hills Footbridge</li>\n<li>Mountbatten Bridge</li>\n<li>Lansdowne Bridge</li>\n</ol>\n\nii) Automatic recorders located at:\n<ol>\n<li>Milperra Bridge</li>\n<li>Cutler Road, Lansvale</li>\n<li>Scrivener Street, Warwick Farm (* This recorder malfunctioned during the flood event.)</li>\n<li>Liverpool Weir</li>\n<li>Prospect Creek, Lansdowne</li>\n</ol>",

    "description": "The Portland Passive Acoustic Observatory consists of two to four moorings fitted with hydrophones set on the seabed at ~170 m depth that record noise in the ocean. This system can be used to monitor whale and fish migrations, seismic activity and other natural and man-made noise sources. If four moorings are set they are configured with a mooring at each apex of an approximate equilateral triangle of 5 km side with the fourth mooring in the triangle centre. Temperature loggers are set on each mooring at the seabed.\n\nEach logger records at a sampling rate of 6 kHz for between 3-8 min of every 15 min. If four loggers are set a 22 kHz recording is also made once a day to allow accurate synchronisation of the instrument clocks. This is required for locating the source of a sound based on its time of arrival at each hydrophone in the array. A 7 kHz pinger set on the central mooring pings for 35 minutes at a 20 s interval once per day to overlap the 22 kHz sample.\n\nRaw data from each logger is in the form of mixed binary/text files comprised of:\n1) text header and footer containing recording start and end date/time, quality control and sampling configuration; and\n2) sea noise data of 16 bit unsigned integer, binary values (IEEE, little endian).\n\nInstruments are calibrated for system gain with white noise of known level input with the hydrophone in series, before and after deployments. System calibrations are made over 2 Hz to the Nyquist frequency. The instrument clock drift is checked against GPS transmitted UTC time before and after deployment.\n\nThe raw data can be obtained on portable disk from IMOS eMarine Information Infrastructure (eMII).\n\nThe Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST) at Curtin University has developed Matlab software to process and analyse these data.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with GP costs, and out-of-pocket cost per GP attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare-subsidised patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances exclude services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Petrel Sub-basin Marine Survey GA-0335 (SOL5463) was acquired by the RV Solander during May 2012 as part of the Commonwealth Government's National Low Emission Coal Initiative (NLECI). The survey was undertaken as a collaboration between the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and GA. The purpose was to acquire geophysical and biophysical data on shallow (less then 100m water depth) seabed environments within two targeted areas in the Petrel Sub-basin to support investigation for CO2 storage potential in these areas.\n\nThe survey mapped two targeted areas of the Petrel-Sub-basin located within the Ptrl-01 2009 Greenhouse Gas acreage release area (now closed). Data acquired onboard the AIMS research vessel, Solander included multibeam sonar bathymetry (471.2 km2 in Area 1 and 181.1 km2 in Area 2) to enable geomorphic mapping, and multi-channel sub-bottom profiles (558 line-kilometres in Area 1 and 97 line-kilometres in Area 2) to investigate possible fluid pathways in the shallow subsurface geology. Sampling sites covering a range of seabed features were identified from the preliminary analysis of multibeam bathymetry and shallow seismic reflection data. Sampling equipment deployed during the survey included surface sediment grabs, vibrocores, towed underwater video, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profilers and ocean moorings. A total of 14 stations were examined in Area 1 (the priority study area) and one station in Area 2.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the survey activities and preliminary results from survey SOL5463. Detailed analyses and interpretation of the data acquired during the survey will be integrated with new and existing seismic data. This new information will support the regional assessment of CO2 storage prospectivity in the Petrel Sub-basin and contribute to the nation's knowledge of its marine environmental assets.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "We propose to carry out the most ambitious and comprehensive all-sky survey for pulsars and transient sources to date. Using the 20cm multibeam and a new digital filterbank array this survey will create a petabyte digital record of the sky that can be data mined in the future and used to search for relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars, RRATs, and extragalactic radio bursts. The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

The classification is based on the sediment systems and the geomorphologic processes that operate therein. This information is fundamental for predicting how the shoreline responds to the processes that act on it, both in the current and future climate. These include changes in waves and currents associated with sea-level rise and the placement of coastal infrastructure, e.g. sea walls and ports.\n\nThe classification is provided as two maps depicting primary and secondary sediment compartments, defined by polygons intersecting the coastline. The classification is hierarchical, such that secondary compartments fall within the extent of the primary compartments. Compartment extents, as identified by a panel of independent coastal science experts, were based on geology, geomorphology, topography and shoreline aspect. Primary compartment borders occur where these features were identified at scales between 1:250 000 and 1:100 000. Secondary compartment borders occur where these features were identified at scales less than 1:100 000\n\nThe seaward and landward boundaries of the compartments were defined by the offshore bathymetric depth and the onshore topographic elevation, respectively as follows:\n\t-130 m and +50 m elevation values for primary compartments, and  \n\t-50 m and +25 m elevation values for secondary compartments.\n\nThis product is the result of a collaboration between Geoscience Australia and the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Climate Change, Technology and Tertiary Education. The spatial data shown in the maps, along with a detailed report and spatial data for the remaining broader scale compartments, will be available via web delivery in late 2013 through the Geoscience Australia website (www.ga.gov.au).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "The Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update 2020 dataset is the national compilation of catchment scale land use data available for Australia (CLUM), as at December 2020. It replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2018. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. The CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management Classification version 8. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program. Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (2008 to 2019) and scale of mapping (1:5,000 to 1:250,000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale. Date and scale of mapping are provided in a supporting dataset.\r\n\r\n#What’s new?#\r\nThe following areas have been updated since the December 2018 version: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nThe following areas include some reclassification; the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory, rural residential areas in New South Wales.\t\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUM datasets in their databases. \r\n\r\n#Citation#\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

NSW Health now reports daily COVID-19 cases as a total of local and overseas cases. With quarantine-free international travel, overseas origin of cases can no longer be determined immediately, but will be included in the COVID-19 weekly surveillance reports. The NSW COVID-19 cases by location dataset will continue to be published.\nThe data is for confirmed COVID-19 cases only based on location of usual residence, not necessarily where the virus was contracted. The case definition of a confirmed case is a person who tests positive to a validated specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test or has the virus identified by electron microscopy or viral culture, at a reference laboratory. Data reported at 8pm daily.\nCase counts reported by NSW Health for a particular notification date may vary over time due to ongoing investigations and the outcome of cases under review thus this dataset and any historical data contained within is subject to change on a daily basis.\nThe underlying dataset was assessed to measure the risk of identifying an individual and the level of sensitivity of the information gained if it was known that an individual was in the dataset. The dataset was then treated to mitigate these risks, including suppressing and aggregating data. ",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The 2021-22 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2021-22 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2021-22 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2021-22 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2021-22 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2020-21\r\n* 2021-22\r\n* 2022-23\r\n* 2023-24\r\n* 2024-25\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture, Water and the Environment\r\n* Attorney-General's\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education, Skills and Employment\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health\r\n* Home Affairs\r\n* Industry, Science, Energy and Resources\r\n* Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook and Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing are included for reference as well.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay): \nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Sydney (South) - Haymarket in NSW with SA2 code 117031645, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA3. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA3 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents the number of households by household types for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for Local Government Areas (LGA) and VIFSAs for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset in the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nsmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them\n\n\nlarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level\n\n\nas far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

The AIR is a national register that records immunisations given to children to help parents and guardians keep track of their children’s immunisations.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Immunisation rates for children in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe AIR may underestimate coverage due to incomplete submission of immunisation records or the inclusion of children who no longer reside in an area but have not been updated on the register.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"NP\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nRows assigned a \"#\" in the \"Interpret with Caution\" column should be interpreted with caution as these area’s eligible population is between 26 and 100 registered children.\n\n",

    "description": "Survey FK200308 on the R/V Falkor undertook detailed mapping within two significant and biologically unexplored submarine canyons (Cape Range and Cloates Canyon) in the Gascoyne Marine Park. The Gascoyne Marine Park covers 81, 766 km2 adjacent to the Ningaloo Marine Park. The canyons form part of the habitat protection and multiple use zones of the marine park and are identified as Key Ecological Features. The canyons provide an important connection between the abyssal plain environments and the Commonwealth waters adjacent to Ningaloo Reef on the continental shelf. High productivity aided by upwelling through the canyons has been related to aggregations of whale sharks, manta rays, humpback whales, sea snakes, sharks, large predatory fish and seabirds. In addition, the hard canyon walls provide habitat for a range of sessile invertebrates, while the soft sediments on the canyon floor support a range of mobile invertebrates. The data from this survey will provide a comprehensive taxonomic survey to characterise the marine biodiversity of the canyons or to understand the distribution of canyon habitats in relation to the seabed morphology.\n\nThe SuBastian ROV was used to acquire high-resolution video and collect samples. SuBastian is a custom-built work class ROV that conducts scientific work down to 4500m. It is equipped with a Sulis Subsea Z70 deep sea science camera with 4K UHD 2160p optics and sensors for temperature, depth, conductivity and oxygen. \n\nTwenty ROV dives were completed across 16 stations, and these included 12 quantitative imagery transects within the Cape Range Canyon. No quantitative transects were conducted in the Cloates Canyon. The quantitative transects were run for 500 m upslope, ideally at a speed of 0.3 knots and an altitude of 2 m above the seafloor or rock walls.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "<b>Version\n29 January 2020</b>\n\n\n\nMoreton Bay Regional Council has finalised a new planning scheme that supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics. The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "Australia is about to become the premier global exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), bringing increased opportunities for helium extraction. Processing of natural gas to LNG necessitates the exclusion and disposal of nonhydrocarbon components, principally carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Minor to trace hydrogen, helium and higher noble gases in the LNG feed-in gas become concentrated with nitrogen in the non-condensable LNG tail gas. Helium is commercially extracted worldwide from this LNG tail gas. Australia has one helium plant in Darwin where gas (containing 0.1% He) from the Bayu-Undan accumulation in the Bonaparte Basin is processed for LNG and the tail gas, enriched in helium (3%), is the feedstock for helium extraction. With current and proposed LNG facilities across Australia, it is timely to determine whether the development of other accumulations offers similar potential. Geoscience Australia has obtained helium contents in ~800 Australian natural gases covering all hydrocarbon-producing sedimentary basins. Additionally, the origin of helium has been investigated using the integration of helium, neon and argon isotopes, as well as the stable carbon 13C/12C) isotopes of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon gases and isotopes (15N/14N) of nitrogen. With no apparent loss of helium and nitrogen throughout the LNG industrial process, together with the estimated remaining resources of gas accumulations, a helium volumetric seriatim results in the Greater Sunrise (Bonaparte Basin) &gt; Ichthys (Browse Basin) &gt; Goodwyn–North Rankin (Northern Carnarvon Basin) accumulations having considerably more untapped economic value in helium extraction than the commercial Bayu-Undan LNG development.\n\nPresented at Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association (APPEA) Exhibition &amp; Conference 2018\n\n<b>Citation:</b>  Boreham CJ, Edwards DS, Poreda RJ, Darrah TH, Zhu R, Grosjean E, Main P, Waltenberg K, Henson PA.

There can be lags in the registration of deaths with the state or territory registries. Consequently, not all deaths are registered in the year that they occur. In addition, a coroner may investigate a death if the death is unexpected or violent (such as a homicide and suicide), when the identity is unknown, cause of death is not known or if the person is in care or custody. The coronial process can take several years, particularly where an inquest is held, or complex investigations are being undertaken. Therefore, there is a delay in reporting deaths through this process.\n\nDeaths for 2022 and 2023 are preliminary and are subject to change.\n\nThe ACT deaths data is collected and maintained by the ACT registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages (ACT RBDM), which records all medical conditions that directly caused or contributed to the death and were applicable, ie the circumstances surrounding a death (eg. motor vehicle accident).\n\nThe National Coronial Information System (NCIS) records and stores information relating to coroner certified deaths for the purposes of retrieval, analysis, interpretation and dissemination to allow for informed death and injury prevention activities.\n\nThe Australian Coordinating Registry (ACR) is an agency appointed by state and territory RBDMs and coroners to coordinate and manage approval of coded deaths data.\n\n*The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision\n\nThe data is presented by the ACT Government for the purpose of disseminating information for the benefit of the public.

The project was completed by the Office of Environment and Heritage (NSW). The project was funded by the ACT Government to enhance knowledge of soils, landscapes and physical constraints to land use in the urban and rural environment. The information will assist in informed decision making, planning and environmental modelling throughout the catchment.\n\n55 soil landscape map units have been described for the ACT. Each unit is an inventory of soil and landscape information with relatively uniform land management requirements, allowing major soil and landscape qualities and constraints to be identified.\n\nThe GIS product shown here provides location of each of the soil landscape map units - including the soil landscape code and name. For more detailed information please see the full soil landscape reports for each unit, as well as the final report shown at: https://www.environment.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/2079667/soil-landscapes-of-the-act-2016.pdf.

    "description": "This dataset represents the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to contamination evaluated for unconfined aquifers in Fitzroy, based on the DRASTIC method (Aller et al. 1987). This semi-quantitative but spatially distributed method is especially suited for regional investigations with limited data availability. The DRASTIC index is calculated based on seven components: Depth to groundwater, net recharge, Aquifer media, soil media, topography (slope), impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer (Aller et al. 1987). Areas with unconfined aquifers or with shallow water tables receive a high index and, vice versa, area with fractured rock aquifers and deep water tables have a low index.\n\nFor the Upper Spencer Gulf region, based on the spatial distribution of index values, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at the surface is considered not possible if the drastic index is less than 70. In grid cells with DRASTIC index between 70 and 100, unconfined aquifer contamination due to spill at the surface is considered possible but not material. In areas with DRASTIC indices above 100, unconfined aquifer contamination due to a spill at surface is considered material and avoidance and mitigation strategies are considered.\n\nFurther information about the DRASTIC map and the development of this map is described in Holland et al. (2024) [Securing water for an emerging Australian hydrogen industry - Methods report].",

    "title": "Punchbowl Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes parts of the suburbs of Punchbowl,\nMount Lewis and Greenacre. It is an urban catchment that drains through a stormwater pipe network\nand the Sydney Water open concrete channel drainage system in a north-easterly direction towards\nthe Cooks River in the neighbouring Local Government Area (LGA) of Strathfield.\nIt is important to note that the Punchbowl catchment does not represent the entire (hydrological)\ncatchment to Juno Parade (at the Bankstown LGA boundary). The entire stormwater catchment is\nlocated in two LGAs; the western part of the catchment is situated in Bankstown City Council and the\neastern part is situated in Canterbury City Council, covering parts of the suburbs of Roselands, Wiley\nPark and Lakemba. This report focuses on the study area only, although the model was developed\nfor the entire catchment.\n\nFor the remainder of this document and for clarity, the Punchbowl catchment in this report refers to\nthe study area and is wholly located within Bankstown LGA while the entire catchment will be referred\nas the Punchbowl/Roselands catchment.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Indicative information on drainage asset performance for various storm events;</li>\n<li>A property database including surveyed floor levels, flood levels and the resulting floor level\nimmunity, expressed in the magnitude of a storm event;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 510 stormwater pits and 610 stormwater\ndrainage pipes or culverts. The database also contains model results, including information for each\npipe on the design event at which it is running full.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. The adopted grid size for this study is 2m, whereas the flood studies within\nBankstown undertaken prior to 2012 utilise a coarser grid size of 5m. The new grid size has been\nadopted in line with ongoing improvements in computer technology (in particular speed, memory and\nstorage) to provide higher resolution of the floodplain whilst allowing for manageable model\nsimulation times and file sizes. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and\nother assumptions are outlined in the Punchbowl Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is\nincluded as Appendix C.\n\nProperty Database\n\nThis flood study also includes the development of a GIS property database, utilising floor level data\ncollected by Council and comparing these to flood levels for various design flood events. This\ncomparison provides a dataset on floor level immunity, which is a very useful tool for assessing the\nexisting flood risk. Additional information such as property ground levels are also provided as part of\nthe property database. A summary of the property database is presented in Figure 5-1.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\nTable ES- 1 summarises the number of properties at risk from above floor level flooding in the\nPunchbowl stormwater catchment within Bankstown LGA.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

    "description": "This review was a synthesis of studies that monitored the effects of sewage disposal in the marine environment. Twenty studies that were conducted between 1973 and 1997 and met specific design requirements (i.e. no confounding factors, appropriate replication) were included in the review. \n\nBackground data relating to discharge type, quantity, level of detail and sampling procedures of the investigation in each study were collated. Any impact that was detected was recorded for each endpoint. The magnitude of change or effect size was calculated for each study and was defined as the percent change at the impact site relative to the control sites. \n\nThere were some consistencies in the monitoring strategies and benthic responses between studies in different areas. Multivariate indicators and population level analyses were the most sensitive measures for detecting sewage related impacts. Abundance usually increased at outfall sites relative to controls (30-250% magnitude of change) while species richness, diversity and evenness tended to decrease (16-90% magnitude of change). The geographic extent of the studies were limited to temperate regions except for 1 study that was conducted in Antarctica.",

During a thunderstorm, the crack of the\nlightning disrupts the AM signal. The integrated circuit inside the sensor listens for this\ndisturbance and registers the time of and distance (intensity of signal) to the strike. The\nsensor outputs the total number of strikes and average distance to these strikes in the\nmeasurement period.   \nThe City of Ballarat is not an official source of weather information. These observations are provided to the public for informative purposes only. Use other channels for official meteorological observations and forecasts.",

You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThis data represents surface water entitlements inlcuding volumes extracted in ML in the Gippsland PAE. The initial data provided for Surface Water entitlements in the Gippsland PAE was extremely coarse. Water sources from River Basins (in the absence of more spatially representative features such as licence locations) were used in order to assign data to a general location. \n\nAt the Gippsland Asset workshop in December, 2014, better Surface Water Entitlement data was requested and Southern Rural Water provided this data by entitlement location on the 18/12/2014.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis dataset is an intermediate dataset to be included into a revised version of the Gippsland Asset database by ERIN\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nAs the new Entitlement data from Southern Rural Water did not contain volumes but rather individual locations for each entitlement, data was joined by licence number to an internal Bureau of Meteorology national dataset enabling ML per year per licence to be assigned to location. This was done using ArcGIS software.\n\nNote  there17 features without matching licence with a volume.\n\nAll data classified as \"Water Access Right\" as not broken down into the following codes of use:\n\nCODE \tDEFINITION \n\nWSUP \tWater supply \n\nIRAG \tWater supply for irrigated agriculture \n\nSTOK \tWater supply for livestock \n\nDRNK \tPotable water supply i.e. drinking water \n\nHUSE \tWater supply for household needs e.g. washing, toilet \n\nMNAS \tWater supply for mining activities \n\nINDS \tWater supply for manufacturing and industry \n\nINST \tWater supply for institution \n\nCOMS \tWater supply for commercial activities i.e. a service business that does not fabricate a product \n\nRECS \tWater supply for recreation and cultural activities \n\nEXPR \tExploration or research \n\nMINE \tMining i.e. extraction of minerals or energy resources \n\nRECN \tRecreational purposes \n\nMON \tMonitoring of groundwater conditions \n\nDRNG \tDrainage of groundwater principally to lower watertable or remove deleterious groundwater \n\nCULT \tFeature of natural or cultural significance \n\nUNK \tUnknown i.e. purpose of groundwater feature is unknown \n\n\n\nIn order to ensure only volumes and locations that were inside the Gippsland PAE were counted the the GIS location layer was clipped to the Gippsland PAE.\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics\n\n\\*\tCount:\t1144\n\n\\*\tMinimum:\t0\n\n\\*\tMaximum:\t1641.1\n\n\\*\tSum:\t137663.2\n\n\\*\tMean:\t120.334965\n\n\\*\tStandard Deviation:\t239.457137\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) Surface Water Economic Entitlements GIP 20141219.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2008.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

City of Melbourne has commenced a review of the Future Melbourne 2008 plan this year with a view to writing a renewed Future Melbourne 2016-26 plan.\n\n\nTo be able to track Melbourne’s progress according to the aims set out in the Future Melbourne 2008 Plan, City of Melbourne developed and indicators framework including indicators for personal wellbeing and social connection, derived from the Australian Unity wellbeing survey. Australian Unity and the Australian Centre on Quality of Life at Deakin University have conducted national bi-annual population surveys for the last ten years and created an index of perceived wellbeing for the Australian population, including the population of Melbourne. Both organisations support the Index being used and developed as a scientific tool and encourage investigations into the usefulness of the Index by others.\n\n\nCity of Melbourne annually collects data on the personal wellbeing, social connection, self-reported health, volunteering behaviour, food security, acceptance of diverse cultures; engagement in decision making and arts and cultural activities of residents in Melbourne Local Government Area.

    "description": "Core MD88-787 was recovered during the French ASPARA IV cruise in 1988, aboard the Marion Dufresne. The core was located on the Tasman Fracture Zone of the Mid-Ocean Ridge, within the Polar Front Zone.  \n\nA total of 69 diatom species and taxa were recorded in core MD88-787. Over time, the core indicates a reduction in the number of diatom valves in the sediments for the last glacial. This trend is not observed during the previous 'glacial' period in isotope-stage 4, but is again noted in isotope-stage 6. Interglacial isotope-stages 3 and 5 indicate higher- or equivalent-diatom content comparable to isotope-stage 1. The reduced diatom signal during the glacials appears odd since the expectation was for an enhanced diatom signal produced by the northward shifting fronts. The decrease in signal could be interpreted as being affected by sea-ice cover and the resulting change towards more lightly silicified diatom species.",

The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of unpublished Department of Health data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nRHOF services are provided in Inner regional, Outer regional, Remote and Very remote areas only and therefore only Indigenous patients seen within non-metropolitan PHNs are represented in the data.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nPatients may have more than 1 occasion of service.\n\n\nThe identification of Indigenous patients varies between practitioners, so the number of occasions of service for Indigenous patients may be understated.\n\n",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2014.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "title": "Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) and Non-CALD Populations (2006)",
    "description": "This dataset provides a composite measure of heat vulnerability for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) populations in Australia, integrating three key indicators: heat exposure, heat sensibility, and heat adaptive capability. Derived from social and environmental variables in CALD-specific AURIN datasets, it provides data for 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2021, utilising the 2021 SA1 boundaries to enable retrospective comparison. This framework allows for the assessment of heat vulnerability trends across diverse neighbourhoods, supporting targeted strategies for mitigating heat-related risks and fostering resilience and equity in urban environments.\nEffective Use Case Descriptions:\nHeat Vulnerability Assessment and Planning: Urban planners and environmental agencies can use the Integrated Heat Vulnerability Index to identify and prioritise CALD and non-CALD neighbourhoods most at risk from heat-related impacts. By analysing the index, they can develop targeted heat mitigation strategies such as enhancing green spaces, improving building insulation, or increasing access to cooling centres. This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated effectively to areas with the highest vulnerability.\nPublic Health Interventions: Public health officials can utilise the heat vulnerability index to assess the risk of heat-related health issues in different neighbourhoods. By integrating indicators of heat exposure, sensibility, and adaptive capability, health agencies can design and implement targeted outreach programs, heat-health warnings, and community support initiatives to protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat events. \nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Climate resilience experts can apply the index to evaluate the effectiveness of past and current climate adaptation measures. By comparing heat vulnerability trends over time, they can identify gaps in adaptive capacity and recommend improvements to climate resilience strategies. This helps ensure that adaptation efforts are addressing the needs of the most affected communities. \nPolicy Development and Advocacy: Policymakers and advocacy groups can leverage the data to support evidence-based policy development and advocate for climate justice. The index provides a clear picture of how heat vulnerability varies across neighbourhoods, allowing for the formulation of policies that address inequities and promote inclusive urban planning. It can also be used to justify funding for heat mitigation and adaptation projects in vulnerable areas.\nCommunity Engagement and Education: Community organisations can use the heat vulnerability index to raise awareness about heat risks and promote community-driven solutions. By sharing insights on heat exposure and adaptive capabilities, these organisations can empower residents to participate in local heat resilience initiatives and advocate for improvements in their neighbourhoods. \nResearch and Academic Studies: Researchers can use the index to study the relationship between heat vulnerability and various socio-environmental factors. The longitudinal data enables analyses of how changes in urban development, demographic shifts, and climate change impact heat vulnerability over time, contributing to the broader understanding of environmental justice and urban resilience.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Senior Secondary Colleges in Victoria for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "The Coastal Lake Assessment and Management (CLAM) tool allows stakeholders to assess the social, economic and environmental trade-offs associated with development, remediation and use options for coastal lakes and estuaries. Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to deaths due to all causes (combined) by sex. The reported statistics include year of death, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates, rate ratio, median age at death, premature deaths, potential years of life lost and potentially avoidable deaths. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Local Government Area (LGA) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any LGA with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘h_brackish_saline.shp’ contains polygon data indicating the approximate area where collection or monitoring will most likely provide brackish or saline water due to saltwater intrusion.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behavior near the edges of the island. The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the high brackish or saline boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods.\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "This dataset shows the estimated maximum temperature of the warmest period for the Wet Tropics Bioregion of North Queensland over a 24 month period from January 2007 to December 2008. It was modelled based on weather station data, elevation, foliage cover and distance to the coast. The purpose of this dataset is as a metric for estimating thermal stress on animals living in this region.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nThe maximum temperate was modelled over the region at an 80 m resolution using weather station data with adjustments for elevation, foliage cover and distance from the coast. This allowed the temperature to be estimated for locations where there were no direct measurements of temperature. Models of the maximum temperature for each month of the study were generated. These 24 monthly surfaces were then overlaid and the maximum model temperature for any month was determined for each pixel to generate a summary variable - the maximum temperature of the warmest period (i.e., month).\n\n\neAtlas Processing:\n\nThe GeoTiff supplied with this dataset was produced as follows:\ngdal_translate csbc_05.asc -a_srs \"EPSG:4283\" -co \"TILED=YES\" -co \"COMPRESS=LZW\" -a_nodata -9999.0 WT_JCU_Refugia-max-temp_Jan2007-Dec2008.tif\ngdaladdo -r average WT_JCU_Refugia-max-temp_Jan2007-Dec2008.tif 2 4 8 16 32 64\n\nFormat:\nData format ASCII Grid: 170MB, 4089 x 6372 pixels, GDA_94, 80 m resolution.

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSome AEDC results were captured across two SA2 regions, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",
