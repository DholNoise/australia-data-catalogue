    "description": "This dataset will be obsolete as at 15/01/2026 and has been replaced by hunt25_pests_view.\n\nThis hunting area dataset depicting areas where Pest hunting (Red Fox, European Hare, European Rabbit, Goat, Pig, Wild Dogs) is permitted, have boundaries largely derived from the PLM25 dataset which are supplemented with additional boundaries based on legislative restrictions on hunting. The dataset identifies the conditions under which hunting of given Game and Pest animal groups and species is permitted.\nThe rules used to produce this product were developed by the legislation unit with the Land Management Division of the Department of Environment , Land, Water and Planning in consultation with the Game Management Authority, VicPolice, Parks Victoria and other relevant government authorities. These rules are based on requirements in the Forest Act, National Park Act, Crown land (Reserve) Act, Land Act, Wildlife Act.\nNote : Hunters are personally responsible for acting in accordance with the Firearms Act 1996\n(including informing themselves about any prohibited locations within the areas shown on this map)\nand other relevant laws; obtaining the required hunting licence; and for hunting only within season.\nMore information can be obtained from the Game Management Authority's web site.\n\nVicmap Basemap Services | State Government of Victoria | @DELWP",

Play fairway mapping was used to map the distribution of petroleum plays likely to be developed in a 5 to 10 year time frame.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth by caesarean section and had a general anaesthetic, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth by caesarean section and had a general anaesthetic, divided by the number of females who gave birth by caesarean section and recorded a non-missing value for general anaesthetic, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nCaesarean section is an operative procedure to remove the baby through an incision through the female's abdomen and uterus.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who gave birth through the vagina.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nData were not available for Victoria in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \n\nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

It was predicted that there would be a negative correlation between the level of human activity and the average size of gastropod species such as Cellana tramoserica, Austrocochlea constricta, Turbo undulata, Thais orbita and Nerita atramentosa, which are collected by humans for bait and occasionally for food. Sampling was undertaken in May 1990 and February/March 1991 at 6 locations within the Bunurong Marine Park, Victoria. On each sampling occasion the size of 100 snails of each species was measured at each site.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) for people aged 50 to 74. The NBCSP began in 2006. It aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from bowel cancer by actively recruiting and screening the eligible target population for early detection or prevention of the disease. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of people invited to screen through the NBCSP during the relevant 2-year period, who returned a completed screening test within that period or by 30 June of the following year. The number of individuals invited to screen excludes those who deferred or opted out without completing their screening test.\n\n\nPHN areas were assigned to NBCSP invitees using an SA1 to PHN correspondence. Those invitees without reliable SA1 details were mapped with a postcode to PHN correspondence instead, which may lead to some minor inaccuracies in results.\n\n\nSome invitee SA1 codes and postcodes cannot be attributed to a PHN. These invitees were included in an 'Unknown' group where applicable.\n\n\nSome postcodes cross PHN boundaries, leading to slight inaccuracies.\n\n\nThe time period of some PHN data presented is prior to the initiation of PHNs, which were in established in June 2015.\n\n\nBiennial screening for those aged 50-74 is not fully rolled out. During the time period reported, the specific ages invited within the 50-74 age range included 50, 54, 55, 58, 60, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72 and 74.\n\n\nThese results calculate participation rates using the new NBCSP performance indicator specifications. This indicator now measures a 2-year invitation period and also excludes those who opted off or suspended participation. Therefore, these results cannot be compared to rates reported prior to 2014.\n\n\nNBCSP participation rates per area are not related to bowel cancer incidence rates.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016, and the 2016-2017 period covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017.\n\n\nThe number of people in different PHNs may not sum to 'Australia' total due to rounding.\n\n\nPHN205 Murray includes Albury, NSW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset shows point locations at which geological samples have been taken and/or (less commonly) geological observations or measurements have been made. Only basic information is included, but further data for each point may be available on-line from the Mineral Resources Tasmania website (go to Products and Services/Database Searches/Samples and Geochemistry Search or use this link): https://www.mrt.tas.gov.au/products/database_searches/mineral_deposits,_drilling_and_sampling/samples_and_geochemistry and click on Search, then Export Results)\nData attached to each sample ideally includes metric coordinates (or sometimes lat/long), locality name and description, positional accuracy (3D), field and registration numbers, originator, project, collection date, sample type and description, and may include lithology, lithostratigraphy, chronostratigraphy, minerals, mineralisation types, potential hazards, soil type, storage details, references and comments. Major and trace element analyses and assays, petrophysical data (density, magnetic, electrical, thermal, sonic velocity etc.), electron microprobe analyses of minerals, x-ray diffraction determination of mineralogy, soil tests, photographs, reports and other data may be attached and are also down-loadable.\nMost points refer to surface samples or observations, but down-hole data is also included for some sample types. Data is open to the public for 126,606 records and closed, restricted or reserved for 67,879. \nThe largest dataset is of rock samples (111,778, including 26,685 with whole-rock chemical analyses by x-ray fluorescence). The stream sediment dataset consists of 52,281 samples, mainly collected for mineral exploration and with geochemical results attached. The soil sample dataset (19,626) includes samples collected both for mineral exploration and geotechnical properties.     \nThere are smaller datasets for minerals (i.e. specimens, 4579 samples), mineralised samples (e.g. ores; 2781), sediments (e.g. heavy mineral sands, building sand, gravel, clay, 976), tailings and mine waste (1,926), fossils (344), environmental samples (e.g. dust at mine sites; 160), artificial samples (e.g. slags, metallurgical products, concrete; 289) and concentrates (e.g. of sluiced or panned tin or gold; 107). Drill logs (839) and miscellaneous readings/observations (including physical property measurements; 1610) are also included.",

The data identifies 20 zones covering residential, centre, industry, open space and other zones.  Zones organise the planning scheme area in a way that facilitates the location of preferred or acceptable land uses.  The Zone Codes at Part 6 (Zones) of the Planning Scheme identify the purpose of each zone, along with the assessment benchmarks and outcomes sought for each zone.\r\n\r\n* Community Facilities Zone Annotations - forms part of the Zone Maps of the Bundaberg Regional Council Planning Scheme 2015. Where a zone map provides an annotation for land included in the Community Facilities Zone, the annotation refers to the corresponding use as set out in the definition (Community facilities zone annotation) in Table SC1.2.2 (Administrative definitions).\r\n\r\n* Zone Precincts - forms part of the Zone Maps of the Bundaberg Regional Council Planning Scheme 2015.

    "description": "This dataset contains the experimental data underpinning the development and field testing of the larval seedbox, a modular and passive delivery system designed to scale coral reef restoration. Data include larval culturing, seedbox deployments, and coral settlement surveys conducted at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef in November 2024. The seedboxes facilitated the delayed release of ~14 million competent coral larvae across ~2 hectares of degraded reef, with settlement quantified on 234 tiles placed around seedboxes and at reference sites. The collection documents larval densities, settlement rates, and spatial modelling of dispersal, providing evidence that the larval seedbox significantly enhances settlement compared to natural background levels. These data support the first empirical demonstration of unrestrained, broad-scale coral larval seeding as a practical restoration tool.",

    "description": "This record describes sub bottom profiler data collected on RV Investigator voyage IN2025_V02, ' SOTS: Southern Ocean Time Series automated moorings for climate and carbon cycle studies southwest of Tasmania ' which departed Hobart on the 26th March and returned to Hobart on the 14th April 2025.\n\nThe Kongsberg SBP29 (sub bottom profiler) was used to acquire data containing the specular reflections at different sediment interfaces below the seafloor. The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\n\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2 to 9 kHz. The SBP29 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\n\nData are stored in <em>.raw (251 files 5.66 GB) raw and </em>.seg (250 files 5.63 GB) segy formats at CSIRO.\n\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, and matched filter with replica shaping (for water depths typically &gt;200m) or Bandpass filtering 2-9 kHz (in water depths typically &lt;200 m).  \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The version 1 data has been removed from publication to negate temporal comparisons between v1 (2019) and v2 (2021), as this is a future goal for the product but still in development phase. \n\nThis was a spatial dataset comprising predictions of vegetation condition for biodiversity for the brigalow belt bioregion. The dataset was created using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model based on eight vegetation specific remote sensing (RS) datasets and 17,000 training sites of known vegetation community and condition state. Condition score was modelled as a function of the difference in the RS space within homogeneous vegetation communities. The product was intended to represent predicted BioCondition for year 2019 rather than any single date.",

    "description": "The Ship of Opportunity (SOOP) Facility encompasses both the open ocean and coastal waters, in support of short time-scales associated with ocean prediction and the longer term scales of climate research.  The aim of the SOOP Facility is to implement an integrated observing system in Australian regional seas that link physical, chemical and biological oceanography.  Our ships of opportunity include both commercial vessels on regular routes and research vessels covering more varied routes.  \nThe target regions are the boundary current systems off Eastern and Western Australia, the Southern Ocean, the shelf seas across northern Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef.  This is achieved by the following specific goals:\n1.\tImplement vessels on suitable routes with an integrated system of measurements including physical and biogeochemical parameters \na.\tMonitor the major boundary currents systems around Australia.\nb.\tMonitor both local processes and the interactions of the boundary currents on the continental shelf \n2.\tProvide in situ input and/or validation to model and data analyses covering the waters around Australia.\n\nInstrument Platforms\n\nHigh-density XBT Sections - Five major (HRX) high-resolution XBT lines provide boundary to boundary profiling, closely spaced sampling to resolve mesoscale eddies, fronts and boundary currents.  The lines are repeated 4 times per year with an on-board technician.  The routes sample each major boundary current system using available commercial vessel traffic.  All of the transects transmit data in real-time.\n \nBiogeochemical Program - uses the RV Southern Surveyor and the l' Astrolabe which sample the critical regions of the Southern Ocean and Australian waters, which have a major impact on CO2 uptake by the ocean and are regions where biogeochemical cycling is predicted to be sensitive to changing climate.  Southern Surveyor has a wide spatial coverage and each year covers tropical to sub-polar waters.   \n\nAusCPR - To monitor plankton we use the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), the only platform that can assess plankton species and be towed behind ships of opportunity. Species-level data are vital to examine mesoscale productivity, biodiversity, and climate impacts on marine ecosystems. Two seasonal routes are operated, in the Southern Ocean, and the East Australian Current\n\nSensors on Tropical Research Vessels - Fixed sensor sets maintained on the 2 tropical research vessels (RV Cape Ferguson and RV Solander).  The instruments obtain underway observations of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, fluorescence, light absorption, and irradiance.  \n\nSST Sensors - Implemented on Australian Volunteer Observing Fleet (AVOF) vessels and several passenger ferries.  Hull-mounted sensors supply high-quality bulk SST data fed into existing data management systems and broadcast via satellite back to Australia every one to three hours.  Radiometers on ferries supply high-quality skin SST data in near real-time.  \n\nResearch Vessel Real-time Air-Sea Fluxes - Research vessels have been equipped with \"climate quality\" met. systems, providing high quality air-sea flux measurements and delivered in near real-time.  Data are broadcast via satellite back to Australia daily.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset is a shapefile derived based on the mine expansion plan boundaries digitised from various reports. It represents the Coal Resource Development Pathway (CRDP) for the Startford Mine, the Rocky Hill Project and the Duralie Mine within the Gloucester subregion. Mining company reports contain maps of proposed expansion plans for these mines and these were digistised to represent the future expansion of mine footprints for the CRDP. These areas were used in modelling of surface water and groundwater to assess likely the impacts of mining on water resources in the Gloucester subregioin.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nUsed to represent the existing mining footprints for mines operating in the Gloucester Basin.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nFuture expansion plans for mine boundaries were digitised from various reports by georectifying images scanned from the reports.  These were used as background images to digitise the boundaries within ArcGIS.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) GLO AEM Model CRDP Mine Footprints v01.

    "description": "The October 2022-23 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2022-23 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the October 2022-23 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in October Budget Papers Nos.1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2022-23 Budget Measures\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements. \r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘October 2022-23 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1. \tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements and\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2021-22\r\n* 2022-23\r\n* 2023-24\r\n* 2024-25\r\n* 2025-26\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry\r\n* Attorney-General's\r\n* Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education\r\n* Employment and Workplace Relations\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health and Aged Care\r\n* Home Affairs\r\n* Industry, Science and Resources\r\n* Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both October Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook and October Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing are included for reference as well.\r\n",

    "description": "Soil waterlogging hazard was digitally mapped as part of the DPIPWE Water for Profit Program to enhance identification of Enterprise Suitability by effectively incorporating a sustainability measure of vulnerable soils.  The mapping shows areas where a waterlogging hazard might exist if sufficient management is not applied, which could lead to soil resource degradation, trafficability issues and crop losses.  Assigned classes are; Nil, Very Low, Low, Moderate, High and Very High as classified ratings of a waterlogging hazard index.  The index was generated by combining Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) inputs of the soil properties of soil drainage index and permeability index, and mapped areas of flood risk, where very poor drainage and low permeability imply a high waterlogging hazard, and rapid drainage and high permeability imply a low waterlogging hazard.  The mapping covers the entire state of Tasmania at 30m resolution.",

The regions include the Upper North East, Lower North East, Eden and Southern. \nNSW forest agreements provide a framework for long-term decisions on forest use and management. They were formed from consultation and consensus established between the NSW Government and major forest stakeholders. \nForest agreements impart certainty for industry, conservation and the community. They deliver on the NSW Government's forest policy to:\n• protect environmental values in a world-class system of national parks and other reserves\n• encourage the creation of forest industries that are strong, competitive and ecologically sustainable \n• manage native forests in an ecologically sustainable way.\nThe agreements are for 20 years and progress on their implementation is reported annually. Further information on each NSW forest agreement is available on the EPA website at\nhttp://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/forestagreements/FAS.htm",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include High profile reef, Medium profile reef, Low profile Reef, Patchy Reef, Sand, Hard Sand, Silty Sand, Silt, Seagrass, Patchy Seagrass, Sparse Seagrass and Caulerpa. The data was collected through intensive field sampling from June to December 2000 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The use of underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data and a Differential GPS unit allowed for the extensive area to be surveyed. The dataset is intended to be used to fulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995.",

    "title": "AIHW - Maternity Indicators - Antenatal Care Visit in First Trimester for All Women Giving Birth (%) (SA3) 2014-2016",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of antenatal care visits in the first trimester for all women giving birth, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and who had their first antenatal care visit (before 14 weeks gestation), divided by the total number of females who gave birth with a stated first antenatal care visit, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. Gestational age at the time of the first antenatal care visit is assessed from the best estimate of gestational age available.\n\n\nAn antenatal care visit is an intentional encounter between a pregnant female and a midwife or doctor prior to labour to assess and improve maternal and fetal wellbeing throughout pregnancy and prior to labour.\n\n\nAll females who gave birth are included for the calculation of this indicator.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nRecords with missing or invalid data for gestational age at first antenatal visit were removed from the denominator. The valid range for gestational age is 3-46 weeks.\n\n\nFrom 2014, Caesarean section at most recent previous birth indicator data item was introduced into the Perinatal NMDS. Although not an NMDS/DSS item prior to 2014, data items appear to match the data element developed by NPDDC, Caesarean section indicator (last previous birth).\n\n\nFor ACT, the first antenatal visit is often the first hospital antenatal clinic visit, scheduled for around 16-18 weeks of pregnancy. In many cases, earlier antenatal care provided by the woman’s general practitioner is not reported.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Manipulative field experiments were used to investigate the effects of the ascidians Botryllus schlosseri and Ascidiella aspersa and the bryozoan Bugula neritina on sessile invertebrate assemblages. Experiments were conducted on perspex plates suspended from Workshops Jetty, Williamstown, Victoria. All 3 introduced species affected the abundance of sessile marine invertebrates, but the effects were varied and not always negative or concentrated on native species. B. neritina increased the abundance of native species, A. aspersa increased the abundance of introduced species and B. schlosseri decreased the abundance of both native and introduced species. This research shows that effects of some introduced species are highly variable and do not conform to typical ideas that exist for introduced species.",

    "description": "Fixed cameras installed at the Samford Peri-Urban SuperSite provide a time series of fine scale data as a long-term record of vegetation structure and condition. This dense time series of phenocam images provides data for analysis of ecological responses to climate variability, and when consolidated across the entire terrestrial ecosystem research network, supports calibration and validation of satellite-derived remote sensing data, ensuring delivery of higher quality results for broader scale environmental monitoring products.   \n\n\nThe Samford Peri-Urban SuperSite was established in 2010 in remnant fringe eucalypt forest, near urban development in the Samford Valley. The upper storey is dominated by <em>Corymbia intermedia</em>, <em>Eucalyptus siderophloia</em> and <em>Lophostemon suaveolens</em>. For additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/samford-peri-urban-supersite/ .\n\n\nPhenocameras mounted at three locations within the boundaries of Samford Ecological Research Facility recorded images of vegetation change over a three/four month period in 2015.\n\n\nOther images collected at the site include photopoints, digital cover photography (DCP), panoramic landscape, and ancillary images of fauna and flora.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of female cancer mortality statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 11 top cancer groupings (breast, cervical, colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, ovary, pancreas, thyroid and uterus) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a PHN. The number of people who could not be assigned a PHN is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

    "description": "This study examines the effects of  trampling on rocky intertidal platforms dominated by the brown algae Hormosira banksii.   This dataset gives the percent cover of Hormosira  banskii in response to four levels of experimental trampling applied over six summers, between 1991 and 1996, within Point Nepean National Park, Victoria.  Two sites were located at Cheviot Beach (Harry's Pool, Cheviot Mid) and one at Grenade Range (Grenade Range).  The percent cover of Hormosira banskii in each experimental strip of shoreline was assessed  bi-annually for six years. Hormosira banksii was affected by trampling but the response varied with location.  At Cheviot beach periodic disturbance produced a pulse response in the cover of Hormosira, but  responses  to a given level of trampling varied among years.  At  Grenade Range there was little recovery between  trampling periods after two years and by this time Hormosira  was almost eliminated at the highest level of trampling.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2019 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "Magnetic fields are fundamental in regulating star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds. Zeeman splitting offers a unique method to directly measure line-of-sight magnetic field strengths in interstellar environments, from the diffuse ISM to dense cores. Observations of HI and OH absorption toward pulsars provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure magnetic fields with high precision, benefiting from pulsars' small angular sizes and reliable Stokes V spectra unaffected by instrumental effects. Our recent tentative Zeeman splitting detections in OH absorption toward PSR J1644-4559 with Parkes reveal magnetic field strengths that suggest magnetically subcritical states, where magnetic pressure counteracts gravity. This challenges conventional theories of subcritical cold neutral medium (CNM) transitioning to supercritical star-forming molecular clouds, emphasizing the need for detailed investigation. We propose a continuation of Zeeman splitting studies through high-sensitivity OH and HI absorption observations of pulsars PSR J1644-4559, J1721-3532, and J1852+0031 using Parkes. By employing an innovative phase-resolved spectral technique and extending integration times, we aim to enhance Zeeman detection sensitivity and study magnetic field transitions in the CNM and quiescent molecular clouds. This work will refine our understanding of subcritical-to-supercritical transitions in star formation, establish pulsar absorption as a robust probe of interstellar magnetic fields, and advance observational techniques critical to star formation studies.",

    "description": "This project is providing a direct assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore reefs of the GBRMP. Underwater visual census (UVC) monitoring of fish and benthic communities is being carried out at 50 no-take marine reserve (green zone) sites and at 50 sites that have remained open to fishing within the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Long-term monitoring surveys are providing information on:\n\n1. The effects of no-take marine reserves on populations of both species that are fished and other non-fished species. \n\n2. Variations in structure of fish communities due to the reserves and natural disturbances.\n\n3. Structure and dynamics of marine species on the sea bed.\n\n4. Coral health, bleaching, incidence and severity of coral disease and coral predators.\n\n5. Temporal monitoring of the relative number of fishing lines recorded at each site will be used to assess the distribution of fishing effort and provide information on the levels of non-compliance with zoning regulations.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2009, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) for women aged 20 to 69, by age group. The NCSP began in 1991. It aims to reduce cervical cancer cases, illness and deaths in Australia. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation in the NCSP for this report was defined as the percentage of women in the population aged 20-69 who had at least one Pap test in a 2-year period. Participation rates were calculated using the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 20-69 for the relevant 2-year reporting period adjusted for the estimated proportion of women who have had a hysterectomy.\n\n\nAn SA3 was assigned to women using a postcode to SA3 correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nPostcode is used for mailing purposes and may not reflect where a woman resides.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to an SA3 and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nSA3s with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed.\n\n\nSA3 data for Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cotter - Namadgi, Fyshwick - Piallago - Hume, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay, and Lord Howe Island were excluded due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nSome duplication may occur where the same test is reported to the cervical screening register in two or more jurisdictions. This may lead to erroneous results when focusing on smaller geographical areas. This may affect border areas more than others.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.21) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). \n\nThe site is classified as an open woodland savanna. The overstory is co-dominated by tree species <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em> and <em>Eucalyptus tentrodonata</em>, and average tree height is 14-16&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is close to 64&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 1750&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 30.4&nbsp;°C (in July) to 33.2&nbsp;°C (in November), while minimum temperatures range from 19.3&nbsp;°C (in July) to 25.4&nbsp;°C (in November). Therefore, the maximum and minimum range varies from 7&nbsp;°C (wet season) to 11&nbsp;°C (dry season).\n\nThe instrument mast is 23&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.",

    "description": "In the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, males attract females to their burrows by waving their enlarged yellow claw. Colour is clearly involved in species recognition in U. mjoebergi, but the role of the species-specific colour pattern has not been investigated. \n\nHere we show that U. mjoebergi females preferentially approach uniformaly yellow claws over bicoloured, yellow and white, claws. This is not due to a preference for a larger yellow signal, as they fail to discriminate between bicoloured claws differing in the proportion of yellow. Claw colour and pattern appear to be equally important in the recognition of conspecific males, as females do not distinguish between a uniformly coloured claw of the wrong colour and a claw containing yellow in the wrong pattern.\n\nExperiments were conducted in October 2005, near the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2019 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

It includes venue classification and the allocation of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) throughout Victoria.\nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nChanges in trading name:\n\n\nMILDURA GRAND HOTEL changed name to GRAND ON DEAKIN in February 2017\n\n\nZEGAME'S CARDINIA HOTEL changed trading name to CASTELLO'S CARDINIA HOTEL in Aug 2016.\n\n\nVICTORIAN HARNESS RACING SPORTS CLUB changed trading name to MVRC JUNCTION CLUB in May 2017\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data through joining it with gaming venue locations from the VCGLR's interactive map of Victoria's gaming venues extracted on the 8th of March 2019. Therefore venues that have either changed their trading name or cease to exist as of the 8th of March 2019 will not be included in this dataset, despite being active in the year expenditure was recorded. \n\n\nEGM Numbers: Average number of operating EGM's at the gaming venue during the month. This figure is consistent with the average entitlement applied to the EGM as per tax calculation.\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8.

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2011, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the East Gippsland CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the East Gippsland Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset contains multibeam sonar bathymetry data from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe Beetaloo GBA region in the Northern Territory of Australia currently supports a modest gas extraction industry. With the possibility of a significantly expanded industry in the future, it is important to understand the current environmental impacts of the industry. Towards this end, this analysis examines the effects of current gas extraction activities on vegetation cover condition in the Beetaloo GBA region. It does this using the Compere relative benchmarking framework, which has been parameterised here to use ground cover fraction data (which is an excellent proxy for landscape condition) and to separate-out the variability in ground cover associated with natural processes from the variability associated with human activities. Results show that gas extraction wells and gas pipelines had significant negative effects on cover condition at their immediate locations compared to vegetation in the surrounding 1 km of land. Beyond distances of 1 km, pipelines seemed to have no further effect on condition whereas at distances between 1 and 4 km from wells, condition was found to be significantly lower than at the well location itself. The reasons for this are not known. Given that only minimal extraction activities currently occur across the Beetaloo GBA region, this study provides a baseline assessment against which future analyses could be compared if the industry is further developed.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nCSIRO\n\n\n## **History** \nSix input datasets were used to define biophysical equivalence (locations of similar growing conditions): precipitation, burned area; elevation, available water holding capacity, and long-term average tree foliage cover fraction.  Precipitation data were from the monthly data of Jones et al. (2009).  Burned area data (MCD64A1, Collection 6) were from Giglio et al. (2009); elevation from Gallant et al. (2011); water holding capacity from Viscarra Rossel et al. 2014 and tree fractional cover were based on the methods of Donohue et al. (2009).  Cover condition was assessed using total cover fraction data of Guerschman et al. (2015), which is based on MCD43A4 C6 imagery.  Surface Water Points data were used to test results and were sourced from Crossman and Li (2015).\r\n\r\nCrossman S, Li O (2015). Surface Hydrology points (Regional). Geosciences Australia.

The voyage took place from 11-22 November 2021 departing from Hobart (TAS) and returning to Hobart (TAS).\nThe Kongsberg EM710 MKII multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry,  backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter through the shelf-break region and seamount clusters within Huon AMP.\nThe EM710 MKII provides a 0.5° by 1° transmit and receive angular resolution respectively. The echosounder's nominal frequency range is from 40 to 100 kHz.\nData are stored in .all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .wcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are: \n\n196 raw *.all files totalling 4.32GB in this dataset.\n25 raw *.wcd files totalling 49.6GB in this dataset \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nTide corrections were not applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format, and processed bathymetry and backscatter grids in geotiff format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request.",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Perth City SA2 by AURIN.",
