At any given time data from all available satellites is included in the mapped and gridded data product. At times only data for TOPEX/Poseidon is available. This is indicated in one of the fields in the data file. Data comes from TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-1/2 up until about June, 2003. After that data comes from the follow-on missions - Jason-1 and Envisat. The data is on a 1 degree Mercator grid - the longitude grid spacing is always 1 degree. The latitude grid spacing is 1 degree at the equator, but gets smaller with distance from the equator. This data set is in a relatively easy to use format. The data was provided by Aviso/CNES in France and has been reformatted into a netCDF file at CSIRO Marine Research in Hobart. Available on-line on the CSIRO Marine Research network; also available to outside users on request.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~175cm into the core. Four samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; the top two, at the sediment surface (GC12-0) and at 30cm (GC12-30) represent interglacial sediment, while the lower two, at 210cm (GC12-210) and 330cm (GC12-330) represent glacial sediment. XRD analysis suggests that the majority of the carbonate is calcite during the interglacials, primarily from pelagic carbonate production. During the glacials and transitions more quartz, feldspar, aragonite and Mg calcite are present. This suggests that there is a changing dominance of pelagic, terrigenous and reef platform material within the core related to sea-level variations.",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated data regarding the number of people employed in multiple jobs and their respective median income by the relevant statistical regions. The data spans from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) boundaries.\nJobs in Australia is a new release that provides aggregate statistics from the recently developed Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers.\nJobs in Australia describes all job relationships accumulated over the course of a year. This means that job counts in this publication are higher than the estimates of filled jobs published in the quarterly Australian Labour Account, which provides a point-in-time, or stock measure. These statistics about jobs also differ from Labour Force Survey statistics, which estimate the number of people who held a job in each month.\nThis data is Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data (catalogue number: 6160.0) used with permission from the ABS.\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThe purpose of this publication is to provide new information about the number and nature of filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. It includes information about multiple job-holding and employment in local areas. Jobs in Australia counts all jobs held during the reference year. This complements and expands on quarterly stock estimates of filled jobs presented in the Australian Labour Account.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

    "title": "An atlas of the lakes of the Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica - ANARE Research Notes 74",
    "description": "From the abstract of the ANARE Research Note:\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills are a series of granite and gneiss peninsulas extending into Prydz Bay, between the Amery Ice Shelf and the Sorsdal Glacier.  They are dissected by steep-sided valleys produced by at least two glacial stages in the Holocene.  There are over 150 freshwater lakes in the hills, ranging from small ponds less than 1 m deep, to glacial lakes up to 10 ha and 38 m deep.  The lakes are young, with the oldest basins being about 9000 years old. Variations in the characteristics of the lakes reflect deglaciation history, proximity to the continental ice margin and exposure to the ocean.  The main source of the water is snow melt, augmented by sea spray into the more exposed lakes.  The waters are well mixed by katabatic winds.  Most lakes thaw for up to 2 months in summer, but some are permanently frozen.\r\n\r\nThe waters have mainly low conductivity and exceptionally low turbidity, and have near-neutral pH values.  The ionic order is Na+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than K+.  This reflects a strong marine influence, with calcium dominating in a very few catchments.\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills were discovered in 1935 by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen in the Thorshavn.  Australian, Chinese and Russian stations were established in the area in the mid-late 1980's.  Law (Australia) was commenced in 1986 when an Apple Hut was unloaded from MV Nella Dan.  A subsequent visit was made during the 1986 winter.  The first Australian scientific expedition visited the area during the 1986-87 austral summer.  Progress Station (Russia) was occupied at the time.  Building of Zhong Shan commenced in January 1989.\r\n\r\n*******************\r\n\r\nSeveral files are associated with this metadata record:\r\n\r\n1) A PDF copy of the original ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n2) A CSV file containing the data presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n3) A shapefile of the lakes presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\nThe fields in this dataset are:\r\n\r\nlake_id\r\n\r\nlake_name (text)\r\n\r\nlocation (text description)\r\n\r\nlongitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\nlatitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\naltitude (m)\r\n\r\nlake_area (ha)\r\n\r\ncatchment_area (ha)\r\n\r\nmaximum_depth (m)\r\n\r\ndimensions (m)\r\n\r\ndistance_from_polar_plateau (m)\r\n\r\ndescription (text)\r\n\r\ngeology (text)\r\n\r\nwater_temperature (C)\r\n\r\npH\r\n\r\nwater_conductivity (micro mho/cm)\r\n\r\nEh (reduction potential, mV)\r\n\r\nca_concentration (Ca++, ppm)\r\n\r\nmg_concentration (Mg++, ppm)\r\n\r\nna_concentration (NA+, ppm)\r\n\r\nk_concentration (K+, ppm)\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_na_ca_mg_k (ionic ratio of na:(ca+mg+mk))\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_ca_na_k_mg (ionic ratio of ca:(na+k+mg))\r\n\r\nbottom_sediment_grab_sample (text description of results)\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This study was conducted from December 1979 to December 1981 to determine the diet of Siphonaria diemenensis in the high and low intertidal zone on the rocky shore at Griffith Point, San Remo, Victoria. \n\nGut contents analysis indicated that in both zones the limpets were feeding primarily on encrusting brown algae (e.g. Ralfsia verrucosa and Scytosiphon lomentaria). In an experimental manipulation, limpets were excluded from 15 x 15cm areas of rock to determine the change in algae cover in the presence and absence of limpets. Two runs of this experiment were conducted in Zone 1 from February to September and from September to December in 1980. The change in algae cover during the experiment was generally greater in the exclusion plots. This supports conclusions from the gut contents analysis, that encrusting brown algae form the major part of the diet of S.diemenensis.\n\nA growth experiment was conducted from 5 September to 15 November 1981 in Zone 1. There were 12 enclosures (15 x 15cm) with 15 limpets in each. Three enclosures were assigned to each of the 4 treatments; Ralfsia, Scytosiphon, scraped or bare. At the end of the experiment, 5 individuals were collected from each enclosure and their shell lengths and dry tissue weights measured. The mean shell length and dry tissue weights were greater in the Ralfsia and Scytosiphon treatments compared to the bare and scraped indicating that the presence of brown algae can be beneficial to this species of limpet. \n\nAlgal abundances were monitored throughout this study by analysing photographs of permanently marked quadrats (50 x 50cm) at each of the study sites (3 sites in Zone 1 and 2 sites in Zone 2). Photographs were taken at monthly intervals from December 1979 to December 1981. In Zone 1, there was a clear seasonal trend in algae cover with a minimum cover in summer (January to March) and a maximum in spring (August to December). In Zone 2, there was no seasonal trend but a 100% cover of encrusting brown algae at all times. \n\nIndividual adults were marked in both zones in April 1980 (42 in Zone 1 and 43 in Zone 2) and again in January 1981 (104 in Zone 1 and 66 in Zone 2) by cementing a small numbered label to the shell with a clear epoxy resin. The positions of marked individuals were measured regularly over a period of 8 weeks in 1980 and 1981. Over 70% of individuals were observed to home back to their original positions after 8 weeks with the remainder moving to new positions. Limpets were observed to begin to move at least 1 hour before being exposed to air on a receding tide, and to cease movement between 1 and 2 hours after they were uncovered.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information from 2016 at the household level; the percentage of households within each Index of Household Advantage and Disadvantage (IHAD) quartile for Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) 2016 boundaries.\nThe IHAD is an experimental analytical index developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that provides a summary measure of relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage for households. It utilises information from the 2016 Census of Population and Housing.\nIHAD quartiles: All households are ordered from lowest to highest disadvantage, the lowest 25% of households are given a quartile number of 1, the next lowest 25% of households are given a quartile number of 2 and so on, up to the highest 25% of households which are given a quartile number of 4. This means that households are divided up into four groups, depending on their score.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 4198.0) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has calculated the number of households for each IHAD quartile based on the Occupied Private Dwellings count and the percentage of households in each quartile. These calculated columns have been appended to the original dataset.\n\n\nA household is defined as one or more persons, at least one of whom is at least 15 years of age, usually resident in the same private dwelling. All occupants of a dwelling form a household. For Census purposes, the total number of households is equal to the total number of occupied private dwellings (Census of Population and Housing: Census Dictionary, 2016 cat. no. 2901.0).\n\n\nIHAD output has been confidentialised to meet ABS requirements. In line with standard ABS procedures to minimise the risk of identifying individuals, a technique has been applied to randomly adjust cell values of the output tables.  These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.\n\n",

Many of the worms in this collection were donated by one of Australia’s most famous parasitologists and zoologists, Professor T. Harvey Johnston.  Some of Johnston’s specimens were collected when he travelled to Antarctica as Chief Zoologist with Sir Douglas Mawson in 1929 as part of the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expeditions.\nMaterial is either kept in bottles of ethanol or mounted on microscope slides.  The AHC is used frequently by researchers and students, nationally and internationally, for taxonomic and biodiversity studies.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Melbourne CBD - East in VIC with SA2 code 206041503, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This technical report uses farm survey data to measure the contribution of cross-farm resource reallocation to industry-level productivity growth within Australian broadacre agriculture. The results show that resource reallocation between farms accounted for around half the industry-level productivity growth that occurred between 1978 and 2010, and its contribution appears to have increased over time. This effect is mainly caused by the asymetric impact of technological progress on incumbent farms, as reflected in difference in productivity growth and the relative mobility of different production factors. These findings provide useful insights for policy-makers considering industry-level reforms as a means of imrpving aggregate agricultural productivity. ",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for macroinvertebrates in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate the scores for macroninvertebrates presented in the HWS for three scenarios:\n\n<ul><li>Current: habitat suitability under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.</li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.</li></ul>\n\nData has also been captured for a range of modelled HSM scenarios involving revegetation, stormwater management and climate change. Primary purpose is for waterways planning and analysis.\n\n\n\nHabitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. \n\n\n\nFurther reading: Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership\n\nMelbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "This study used a mark-recapture method to examine the patterns of shell growth of Lepsiella vinosa on the rocky shore at West Head, Victoria. Individuals were collected from the West Head shore on 24th March 1974 and 29th May 1975. They were transported back to the laboratory and marked with individually labeled tags. The next day they were released in the field in the areas from where they were collected. Study sites 1 and 2 were searched on 36 occasions between 25th April 1974 and 28th June 1978. The number of marked individuals, the number of unmarked individuals, and the shell length of marked individuals in the study sites were recorded. When marked individuals were recpatured on successive 1-month or 2-monthly sampling occasions the monthly or mean monthly growth-increments were calculated. \n\nThere was a total of 254 marked individuals recapture and a total of 626 growth increments recorded. The growth rate of L.vinosa depended on the size of the individual and ranged between 0.025 and 0.4 cm per month. Maximum growth of L.vinosa in all size classes occurred between September and October. Variation in growth rate between seasons was most evident in size classes from 1.00 to 1.09 cm and less pronounced in larger size classes from 1.10 to 1.59cm.",

The data is aggregated to the 2019 edition of the Local Government Areas (LGA).\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 3235.0) available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data.\n\n\nRegions which contain unpublished data have been left blank in the dataset.\n\n",

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is part of the suite of technologies that will contribute to lowering atmospheric emissions of CO2 from Australia's energy system. There are a wide variety of technologies at various stages of technical and commercial readiness, with more development underway for cost effective CO2 capture and storage. Our research will provide new knowledge to inform cost-efficient measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) of the environment of CCS projects in coastal waters.\n--o--\nA Seabird model SBE-45 thermo-salinograph was installed in the carbon team’s container and measured seawater from the ship’s auxiliary seawater pump for the duration of the voyage.  \nSurvey settings:\nA flow of 1.6-1.8 litres per minute was maintained through the instrument.  Readings were recorded once per minute.\nCalibration Information:\nThe instrument is new and was calibrated by the manufacturer in 2017.  Salinity samples were collected for later analysis and a correction will be applied if needed.",

    "description": "This index has been compiled by Mrs T. Thompson of Kalgoorlie from the following cemeteries and cemetery records:\r\n\r\n* Old Boulder - Anglican Section of the Cemetery Board Register 224 names\r\n* Headstones all denominations 41 names\r\n* Roman Catholic 189 names\r\n* Baptist 12 names\r\n* Presbyterian 69 names\r\n* Church of Christ 9 names\r\n* General 6 names\r\n* Methodist section 290 names\r\n* Bulong Headstones 19 names\r\n* Kanowna Cemetery Board Register\r\n* Ora Banda Cemetery\r\n* Siberia Cemetery.\r\n\r\nEntry into the index is by name of person being buried and information given is what appears on the headstone or what is transcribed in the burial register. This can include age; relatives eg: parents, wives, husbands, children; date of death, where lived (from headstone) plus denomination, Officiating clergyman, date of burial, name of Undertaker, residence of friends (if known), remarks (if any), grave number section and subsection (from Register).\r\n\r\nThe Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia. A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.\r\n\r\nThe dataset contains: a csv file with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.\r\n\r\nThe transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including:\r\n\r\n* Some cards are missing\r\n* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information\r\n* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not\r\n* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card\r\n* As the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.\r\n\r\nIt is still a very valuable dataset as it contains a wealth of information about early settlers in Western Australia. It is of particular interest to genealogists and historians",

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers for whom smoking status in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was 'Not stated' and mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset was supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and is presented here as originally supplied. Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on the known details at the time of acquisition.\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the spatial location of all works associated with surface water licences from NSW in the BA regions. The short guide to NSW Office of Water's licensing data has been provided to accompany the dataset (both the spatial locations and the associated licence details). \n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act).\n\n2.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n3.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n4.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n5.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading). This means a spatial select with not find these WALs and the volumes associated with them. The WAL is still related to a particular Water Source and can be re-associated with a different Licensed Work Approval at a later date.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset was extracted from the NSW Office of Water's licensing system. Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area supplied by the Bioregional Assessment project teams for each area.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2013) NSW Office of Water Surface Water Entitlements Locations v1_Oct2013.

    "description": "These visualisations feature Opal Trips for all modes of Public Transport by week, month and year. Visualisations for each of the modes show the number of ticketed trips based on operator, line, contract area (where applicable) and card type.\nAn Opal trip describes where an Opal or Contactless card is used to tap-on and tap-off, including where a single tap-on or tap-off is recorded. All other travel is not included.\nAs of 1 July 2024, the methodology for calculating trip numbers for individual Lines and Operators has changed to better reflect the services our passengers use on the transport network. The new approach applies to Train, Metro and Light Rail and will soon be extended to Ferry and Bus. Aggregations between Line, Agency and Mode levels are no longer valid as a passenger may use several lines on a single trip. Trip numbers at Line, Operator or Mode level should be used as provided without further combination.\nThis dataset has reports based on both the new and old methodology with reports progressively moved to the new method in the coming months. Due to the change in method care should be taken when looking at longer trends that utilise both datasets.",

The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP120 was logged mainly on transits as all ship's acoustics were turned off to listen for beacons on most operations.\nData are stored in .raw  and .seg formats at CSIRO (30 lines 7.0 GB)\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to deaths due to all causes (combined) by sex. The reported statistics include year of death, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates, rate ratio, median age at death, premature deaths, potential years of life lost and potentially avoidable deaths. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any SA3 with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "**Liabilities:**\r\n\r\n‘Capital and Reserve Bank Reserve Fund’ whereby the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund (RBRF) is a general reserve. RBRF provides for potential losses arising from events which are contingent and non-foreseeable, mainly those which arise from movements in market values of the RBA’s holdings of Australian dollar and foreign securities as well as from fraud and other non-insured losses or events. On 1 July 2001 the amount of $3 323 million (Contingencies and General Purpose Reserve) was transferred from ‘Other liabilities’ to ‘Capital and Reserve Bank Reserve Fund’.\r\n\r\nPrior to July 1996 the series ‘Exchange settlement balances’ primarily reflected deposits of Australian banks, comprising non-callable deposits and, prior to September 1988, Statutory Reserve Deposits and deposits by savings banks. The Statutory Reserve Deposit requirement on trading banks was removed in 1988 and the non-callable deposit requirement was abolished in July 1999. The Bank commenced paying interest on Exchange settlement balances in July 1996.\r\n\r\n‘RBA term deposits’ are short-term deposits of institutions holding an Exchange Settlement Account and authorised deposit-taking institutions that are members of RITS.\r\n\r\n‘Deposits of overseas institutions’ and ‘Governments and instrumentalities’ include the IMF and central banks.\r\n\r\n‘Other liabilities’ include provisions, current year profit/loss, the counterpart obligation arising from transactions in repurchase agreements, and obligations arising from the outright purchase of securities which have been contracted but not yet settled.\r\n\r\n**Assets:**\r\n\r\n‘Gold and foreign exchange’ assets include foreign exchange holdings invested in government securities and bank deposits, market value of open forward foreign exchange contracts and IMF Special Drawing Rights. Securities sold but contracted for purchase under repurchase agreements are retained on the balance sheet in this category.\r\n\r\n‘Clearing items’ include cheques and bills of other banks, bills receivable and remittances in transit. They may also include amounts owed to the Bank for overnight clearances of financial transactions.\r\n\r\n‘Australian dollar securities’ include Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) and securities issued by central borrowing authorities of state and territory governments. Securities sold but contracted for purchase under sell repurchase agreements are retained on the balance sheet in this category. Also included are Australian dollar securities purchased but contracted for sale under buy repurchase agreements, being: eligible bank bills, certificates of deposit and debt securities of ADIs; Australian dollar-denominated securities issued by certain foreign governments, foreign government agencies and by highly rated supranational organisations; and selected Australian dollar domestic residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed commercial paper and corporate securities.\r\n\r\n‘Other assets’ include the Bank’s holdings of Australian notes and coins, Bank premises and other durable assets, and the Bank’s shareholding in the Bank for International Settlements.\r\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

It provides access to a state wide integrated database and a component of the foundation spatial datasets within the New South Wales. A ‘cadastre’ is an official register of property showing boundaries. \nThe Land Parcel theme contains current land titles only.\n<b>Lot: </b>Depicts a parcel of land created on a survey plan. Each lot may be represented by standard lots, standard part lots, strata or stratum. Each lot has a lot number, section number, plan lot area, plan number, plan label, ITS title status, and stratum label. \n<b>Road: </b>Represents dedicated public roads which are open ways for the passage of vehicles, persons or animals on land. The road dataset includes public roads in use. Each road type has a section number, plan number, plan label, ITS title status, road type, road width or Crown/Council width, lot number, and stratum label.\n<b>Unidentified: </b>Represents a parcel of land that cannot be identified. Crown land, vested, dedicated and severed land may be included in this category as well as Old System lots for which lot/DP identification cannot be found. This dataset also identifies the locations of 100ft wide reserves, ACT regions, closed roads, crossings, surveyed areas, and un-surveyed areas. \n<b>Water Feature: </b>Represents tidal, non-tidal and ocean waters which form a cadastral boundary\nThe NSW Cadastral web service can be used for resource management, environmental management, land use planning, agriculture management, emergency management and recreational purposes. This service can be used to aggregate information for analytical purposes.

    "description": "The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2014 provides both spatial and text information about government, indigenous and privately protected areas for continental Australia. State and Territory conservation agencies supplied data current to 30 June 2014. This is the ninth version of the database, with previous versions released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012.  \n\nThe Department also publishes protected areas data for the marine environment. \"CAPAD 2014-marine\" contains spatial and text information about offshore protected areas, for both State and Commonwealth waters. Previous versions of CAPAD marine information have been published in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012. \n\nCAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area:\"A protected area is an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means\" (IUCN 1994).\n\nThe department publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad/ This version of CAPAD 2014 is a public and downloadable version of CAPAD 2014 data, available for use through the CC-BY licencing model. \n\nMain attributes in the full version of CAPAD 2014 include:\n\nPA_ID: The protected area ID code. Created from RES_NUMBER if unique, otherwise it is a DoE generated number.\n\nNAME: the name of the protected area. Gazetted PAs with no name are flagged as \"Unnamed\" with a reserve number. \n\nTYPE: the type of protected area according to the protected area establishment mechanism. \n\nTYPE_ABBR: the abbreviation of the TYPE.\nACCP\tConservation Covenant\nASMA\tAntarctic Specially Managed Area\nASPA\tAntarctic Specially Protected Area\nBG\tBotanic Gardens\nCA\tConservation Area\nCCA\tCoordinated Conservation Area\nCCAZ1\tCCA Zone 1 National Park\nCCAZ3\tCCA Zone 3 State Conservation Area\nCOR\tCoastal Reserve\nCP\tConservation Park\nCR\tCoastal Reserve\nFLR\tFlora Reserve\nFR\tForest Reserve\nGR\tGame Reserve\nHA\tHeritage Agreement\nHIR\tHistorical Reserve\nHPOT\tBiodiversity Hotspot\nHR\tHeritage River\nHS\tHistoric Site\nHTR\tHunting Reserve\nIPA\tIndigenous Protected Area\nKCR\tKarst Conservation Reserve\nMA\tManagement Agreement\nMAA\tManagement Agreement Area\nMCP\tNational Parks Act Schedule 4 park or reserve\nMNP\tMarine National Park\nMR\tMiscellaneous Reserve\nMS\tMarine Sanctuary\nNAP\tNature Park\nNCA\tNatural Catchment Area\nNCR\tNature Conservation Reserve\nNFR\tNatural Features Reserve\nNP\tNational Park\nNPA\tNational Park Aboriginal\nNPC\tNational Park (Commonwealth)\nNR\tNature Reserve\nNRA\tNature Recreation Area\nNREF\tNature Refuge\nNRS\tNRS Addition - Gazettal in Progress\nOCA\tOther Conservation Area\nOCA/NAP\tOther Conservation Area / Nature Park\nOP\tOther\nPA\tProtected Area\nPNPA\tProposed National Parks Act park or park addition\nPNR\tPrivate Nature Reserve\nPPP\tPermanent Park Preserve\nPS\tPrivate Sanctuary\nRA\tReference Area\nREP\tRegional Park\nRNA\tRemote and Natural Area - not scheduled under NPA/Remote and Natural Area - Schedule 6, National Parks Act (Abbreviated as Remote and Natural Area - not scheduled under Nat Parks Act) \nRP\tRecreation Park\nRR Regional Reserve\nS5G 5(1)(g)\tReserve\nS5H 5(1)(h)\tReserve\nSCA\tState Conservation Area\nSP\tState Park\nSR\tState Reserve\nWPA\tWilderness Protection Area\nWP\tWilderness Park\nWZ\tWilderness Zone\n\nIUCN: the IUCN protected area management category ascribed by the Managing authority, as outlined in the publication: CNPPA/WCMC \"Guidelines for Protected Area management categories\". Gland: IUCN, 1994. (ISBN: 2-8317-0201-1).\n\nDefinitions include:\nIA\tStrict Nature Reserve: managed mainly for science;\nIB\tWilderness Area: managed mainly for wilderness protection;\nII\tNational Park: managed mainly for ecosystem protection;\nIII\tNatural Monument: managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features;\nIV\tHabitat / Species Management Area: managed mainly for conservation through management intervention;\nV\tProtected Landscape / Seascape: managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation;\nVI\t Managed Resource Protected Area: managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems.\n\nGAZ_AREA: area in hectares as described in the nomination document (e.g. parliamentary gazettal), to the nearest hectare. Some protected areas do not have a specific area in the designation.\n\nGIS_AREA: area in hectares based on current spatial data and an Albers equal area projection for Australia. Where protected area consists of multiple polygons (parts) the GIS_AREA is the sum of all the polygons with the same name, type, state and IUCN category. It is this field that is used to calculate the statistics provided in spreadsheets at: www.environment.gov.au/capad/\n\nREPT_AREA is the same with GIS_AREA (previously REPT_AREA is in hectares from the GAZ_AREA attribute and if this is a null value then the GIS_AREA is used. For Protected areas with multiple records, REPT_AREA is a calculated by dividing GAZ_AREA by GIS_AREA of the total then applying this factor to the GIS_AREA of the record). Due to the fact that not all received data have REPT_AREA, it is incomplete and inconsistent if REPT_AREA is used for analysis. \n\nGAZ_DATE: the first gazettal or proclamation date that established any protected area at this site. \n\nLATEST_GAZ: the date of the most recent gazettal or proclamation to add land to the protected area. It can be the same date as the GAZ_AREA.\n\nNRS_PA: This attribute indicates the status of the protected area as part of the National Reserve System (NRS). \"Y\" = Yes. A protected area located within the State and Territory jurisdiction \"I\" = an interim protected area - in the process of being gazetted/established. \"N\" = No. A protected area that does not meet the NRS criteria. \"ND\" = No Data. A protected area that does not meet NRS criteria, but compliments the NRS with sympathetic management.\n\nSTATE: The state is the state that the protected area is located in. EXT= protected areas located in Australian external territories.\n\nAUTHORITY: The Authority responsible for the management of the protected area mechanism. \nAAD\tAustralian Antarctic Division\nAC_SA\tAlexandrina Council\nACT_TAMSD\tACT Territory and Municipal Services Directorate\nAWC\tAustralian Wildlife Conservancy\nAWC & BA\tAustralian Wildlife Conservancy & Birds Australia\nBBT\tBookmark Biosphere Trust\nBHA\tBush Heritage Australia\nCCC_QLD\tCaloundra City Council\nCR PTY LTD\tConservation Reserves PTY LTD\nDOE\tAustralian Government, Department of the Environment\nEAC_QLD\tEwamian Aboriginal Corporation\nEL Inc._NSW\tEnduring Landscapes Inc.\nFC_NSW\tForestry Commission of NSW\nFPR Inc.\tFriends of the Porongurup Range (Inc)\nGCC_NSW\tGosford City Council\nHCR_CMA\tHunter - Central Rivers Catchment Management Authority\nILC_NT\tIndigenous Land Corporation\nIMG\tIndigenous management group\nIMG, LILC\tIndigenous management group and Local Indigenous Land Council\nKRGC_NSW\tKu-ring-gai Council\nLHI_Board\tLord Howe Island Board\nLILC\tLocal Indigenous Land Council\nLVRC_Q_EPA\tLockyer Valley Regional Council and QLD EPA\nMINCA_QLD\tMagnetic Island Nature Care Association\nNF SA Inc.\tNature Foundation SA Inc\nNSC_QLD\tNoosa Shire Council\nNSW_OEH\tNSW Office of Environment and Heritage\nNT_PWCNT\tParks and Wildlife Commission of the NT\nQLD_DERM\tQueensland Department of Environment and Resource Management\nQLD_EHP\tQueensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection\nQLD_EPA\tQueensland Environment Protection Agency\nQLD_NPRSR\tQueensland Department of National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing\nSA_DEH\tSouth Australian Department of Environment and Heritage\nSA_DEWNR\tSouth Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources\nF_SA\tForestry South Australia\nSCRC_QLD\tSunshine Coast Regional Council\nTAS_DPIPWE\tTasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment\nTAS_WPMT\tWellington Park Management Trust Tasmania\nTFN_VIC\tTrust for Nature (Victoria)\nTLC Inc_TAS\tTasmanian Land Conservancy Inc.\nTSRA\tTorres Strait Regional Authority\nTTTN\tThe Trustee for the Trust for Nature\nU.

A protected area can be 'T' terrestrial, marine 'M' and both 'B'. Terrestrial CAPAD 2014 contains 'T' and 'B'. Marine CAPAD 2014 contains 'M'.\n\nOVERLAP: Shows whether or not the protected area is overlapped by another. Protected areas with a value of '1' are the primary protected area in that area. A protected area with a value of '2' is completely overlapped by another protected area.\n\nX_COORD: is the longitude in decimal degrees east within the object closest to the centre of the object using the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994.\n\nY_COORD: is the latitude in decimal degrees south within the object closest to the centre of the object using the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994.\n\nMGT_PLAN: The code of the status of the management plan for the protected area.\n\nDefinitions Include:\nP - In Preparation - Some form of management document was being prepared.\nD - Draft - A draft management document was released for comment by the public, management board or equivalent.\nS - Statutory - Enabling legislation establishes the management of a protected area and separate management document is not required.\nI - Management Intent - A formal statement of management intent has been prepared that clearly sets out the management objectives for the protected area but includes little else.\nM - Management Plan - A formally adopted management plan that has been through consultation and contains strategies and actions for implementation for this protected area. \nR - Regional Plan - A formally adopted management plan has been through consultation and contains general strategies and actions for implementation over a group of protected areas.\nN - Unknown - No form of management document could be found.\n\nRES_NUMBER: The reserve number (if declared) as used by the controlling authority.\n\nOBJECTID *, Shape *, SHAPE.AREA and SHAPE.LEN are automatically generated ESRI attributesCC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis dataset is available under the CC-BY data licencing model and users are required to acknowledge the Australian Government, Department of the Environment as the source of the data in any of their uses. When citing the data please use ‘Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2014, Commonwealth of Australia 2014’.\nThe data is supplied to the Commonwealth for compilation by States and Territories of Australia and custodianship rests with the source agencies. A list of the agencies is available in the acknowledgements section of the metadata entry.\n \nThis CAPAD data has been supplied to the Commonwealth for compilation over a 3 month time frame and has taken several months to get to publication stage. Please note that the information supplied is not up-to-date at the time of publication and release by the Commonwealth.\n \nIt is the responsibility of the person using the CAPAD dataset to always check the metadata for the currency date within each jurisdiction and if required seek advice from the individual agencies on details of more recent gazettals of protected areas.\n \nDue to privacy issues in relation to some covenants on private lands, these data in some jurisdictions are not included in the spatial data, but are included in the published CAPAD summary statistics.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for September 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2015 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The datafile, published by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) contains the composition and abundance of airborne pollen in the campus of the Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia. The data was collected for the period between September 2007 to December 2009 as part of a large research program looking at atmospheric particles and human health and phenology of urban planted environments (unpublished).\nAirborne pollen counts were derived from deployment of a seven-day Hirst-type volumetric pollen and spore trap located on a rooftops at 8m above the ground. The Hirst-type sampler uses a range of adhesive surface compounds including vaseline and 10% paraffin wax in toluene on MelinexTM tape (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK), silicon-based adhesive (Lanzoni s.r.l., Bologna, Italy). The seven-day tapes are then cut into 24-hr segments and mounted on glass slides with a stain such as fuchsine stained Gelvatol. Analysis of each 24-hr period is conducted by counting four transects at 400 magnification. The data is summed to provide an average weekly pollen count.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data, acquired via the ACEAS Data Portal with permission from TERN.\n\n\nThis dataset allows you to filter the data by the date of collection.\n\n",

    "description": "Argo floats have revolutionised our understanding of the broad scale structure of the oceans to 2000 m depth. In the past 10 years more high resolution hydrographic profiles have been provided by Argo floats then from the rest of the observing system put together.\n\nEach Argo float is identified by a unique identification number called a WMO ID. WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) ID Numbers are assigned to measurement stations and observing platforms to enable researchers to keep track of, and uniquely identify their floats.\n\nArgo floats alter their buoyancy by using a battery pack and motor to drive oil from inside the float to an external bladder. This changes the floats volume and thus its density relative to the surrounding seawater allowing it to move up and down through the water column. \n\nA typical Argo float mission is to profile from 2000 m depth to the sea surface every 10 days. On deployment, the float sinks to a depth of 1000 m and drifts with the ocean currents for 9 days. Then the float sinks deeper to its profile depth (usually 2000 m) before starting to ascend through the water column measuring temperature, salinity and pressure as it rises. Once at the surface it transmits location and profile data via satellite to land-based Argo data centres. After transmission the float sinks again and repeats the cycle. \n\nThe average life of the latest model APEX Argo floats are around 3.7 years or approximately 135 cycles. These statistics are for floats with the standard alkaline battery configuration from an analysis by Kobayashi et al (2009).In the Australian Argo program, the floats are deployed with a combination of lithium and alkaline battery packs which extends float lifetime. Argo Australia floats usually last 7 years and several floats are approaching their 9th birthday and are still returning good data.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of family incidents retrieved from Victoria Police. The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of family incidents per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of family incidents recorded in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: Family Incident Rate = (Number of Family Incidents/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe data contains information collected by Victoria Police on the L17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Report. \n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nData was extracted from the Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP) on 18 July 2018.\n\n",

They include areas of sediment supply (sources), sediment loss (sinks), and the sediment transport processes linking them (pathways). Sediment transport pathways include both alongshore and cross-shore processes, and therefore cells are best represented in two-dimensions.

These runs have been completed using only bias corrected SST(Sea Surface Temperatures) and Sea Ice (No Atmospheric) forcings. 4X Daily atmospheric variables are available globally at 18 levels with .5º (60km) resolution on a C64 Grid. There are 1680 daily files in netcdf format, totaling approximately 2.47 TB. Regional climate data is also available for CCAM nested in other GCMS as part of this project. This dataset has also been further downscaled to 14km resolution for the Tasmania region.",

The models were developed through workshops with a wide variety of stakeholders, including community groups, government agencies, researchers, managers and non-government organisations, and discussions with individuals or small groups following the workshops.\n\nEach model was used to assess the current situation and the drivers of change that were negatively impacting the focal asset. Potential management strategies were then identified and the ‘best case management strategy’, where both model stability and asset management were improved, was incorporated in a ‘future’ model. \n\nCommon themes that arose throughout this process were the need to improve water quality throughout the estuary and nearby rivers by reducing nutrient input from various sources, and the need to alter current governance structures to allow effective environmental management.",
