    "description": "The datafile, published by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) contains the composition and abundance of airborne pollen in the suburb of Sandy Bay (University of Tasmania), Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The data was collected for the period between July 2007 to December 2010 as part of a large research program looking at atmospheric particles and human health and phenology of urban planted environments (see Tng, DYP, Hopf, F, Haberle, SG, Bowman, DMJS 2010, Seasonal pollen distribution in the atmosphere of Hobart, Tasmania: preliminary observations and congruence with flowering phenology. Australian Journal of Botany 58, 440–452).\nAirborne pollen counts were derived from deployment of a seven-day Hirst-type volumetric pollen and spore trap located on a rooftops at 12m above the ground. The Hirst-type sampler uses a range of adhesive surface compounds including vaseline and 10% paraffin wax in toluene on MelinexTM tape (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK), silicon-based adhesive (Lanzoni s.r.l., Bologna, Italy). The seven-day tapes are then cut into 24-hr segments and mounted on glass slides with a stain such as fuchsine stained Gelvatol. Analysis of each 24-hr period is conducted by counting four transects at 400 magnification. The data is summed to provide an average weekly pollen count.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data, acquired via the ACEAS Data Portal with permission from TERN.\n\n\nThis dataset allows you to filter the data by the date of collection.\n\n",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "Over the last ten years of rural workforce policies, access to medical practitioners in rural and regional areas has improved. One measure of access is the number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) practitioners per 1,000 people (FTE rate). Since 2013, very remote areas had the highest growth in the FTE rate of medical practitioners. However, challenges continue in very remote areas, particularly in terms of comparable access. The increases in the total number of medical practitioners provides a larger pool available to work in, or provide outreach services to, rural and remote Australia.  \r\n\r\nNurses and midwives are relatively evenly distributed between major cities and rural and regional areas. As the data indicates, remote areas have the highest FTE rate of nurses and midwives while very remote areas has the highest growth in FTE rate.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, allied health practitioners are the fastest growing profession but the most city-centric. The maldistribution is evident as the FTE rate decreases as remoteness increases. \r\n\r\nThe department’s emphasis is on rural and remote end to end training in rural locations as well as the creation of new opportunities for Australian trained health workforce to train and work in rural and remote Australia. Ensuring individual decisions are aligned to what the nation needs from the health workforce in the future is essential.\r\n",

    "title": "Alice Springs Mulga Flux Data Release 2024_v2",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nAlice Springs Mulga flux station is located on Pine Hill cattle station, near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The woodland is characterized by the <i>Acacia aneura</i> canopy, which is 6.5&nbsp;m tall on average. Elevation of the site is 606&nbsp;m above sea level, and the terrain is flat. Mean annual precipitation at the nearby (45&nbsp;km distant) Bureau of Meteorology station is 305.9&nbsp;mm but ranges between 100&nbsp;mm in 2009 to 750&nbsp;mm in 2010. Predominant wind directions are from the southeast and east. The extent of the woodland is 11&nbsp;km to the east of the flux station and 16&nbsp;km to the south. The soil is red sandy clay (50:50 sand:clay) overlying a 49&nbsp;m deep water table. Pine Hill Station is a functioning cattle station that has been in operation for longer than 50 years. The instrument mast is 13.7&nbsp;m tall. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon are measured using the open-path eddy covariance technique at 11.6&nbsp;m. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature and humidity (11.6&nbsp;m), windspeed and wind direction (9.25&nbsp;m), downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation (12.2&nbsp;m). Precipitation is monitored in a canopy gap (2.5&nbsp;m). Supplementary measurements within and below the canopy include barometric pressure (1&nbsp;m), wind speed (2&nbsp;m, 4.25&nbsp;m and 6.5&nbsp;m), and temperature and humidity (2&nbsp;m, 4.25&nbsp;m and 6&nbsp;m). Below ground soil measurements are made in bare soil, mulga, and understory habitats and include ground heat flux (0.08&nbsp;m), soil temperature (0.02&nbsp;m – 0.06&nbsp;m) and soil moisture (0 – 0.1&nbsp;m, 0.1 – 0.3&nbsp;m, 0.6 – 0.8&nbsp;m and 1.0 – 1.2&nbsp;m). Ancillary measurements include soil water and carbon fluxes, leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, stem basal area, stem growth, litter production, leaf area index, stem hydraulic conductance, and carbon and water stable isotope ratios.

    "description": "Human activities in coastal landscapes also exert both direct and indirect pressures on blue carbon (McLeod et al., 2011). Rogers et al. (2019) accounted for this pressure using land-use mapping, with the premise being that natural landscapes are more compatible with storage, preservation, and generation of blue carbon, whilst intensive land-use activities are less compatible. They proposed that this approach partly accounts for socio-economic factors that influence blue carbon. In this study, 2017 land-use mapping was reclassified based on perceived present-day compatibility with blue carbon to generate a blue carbon compatibility (BCC) raster dataset.\nMcLeod, E., Chmura, G.L., Bouillon, S., Salm, R., Björk, M., Duarte, C.M., Lovelock, C.E., Schlesinger, W.H., and Silliman, B.R.

The infrastructure consists of a base station mounted on the existing reef communications tower and a single buoy which carries the actual sensors.\n\nMyrmidon Reef is on the edge of the continetial shelf and so the station is designed to measure upwelling of water from the slope coming up and onto the continential shelf. The station is linked to stations at Rib Reef (mid-shelf) and Orpheus Island (inshore) to track upwelling water across the shelf.",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The beef sectors of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have grown significantly over the past two decades. This report profiles the beef industries of these four beef exporting South American nations, as well as Australia, and evaluates the trends and key factors behind the growth in real export values since 2000. Forward looking scenario analysis based on actual and hypothetical changes to policies and operating environments is undertaken to assess the potential impacts on Australia's future beef exports. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n\r\n Global demand for beef is expected to expand significantly over the next several decades, especially in Asia, which will present opportunities for exporters. \r\n\r\n Australia and South America, together, account for almost half of world trade in beef. \r\n\r\n South America is emerging as a significant competitor for the Australian beef industry, as market access to Australia's traditional markets is improving. \r\n\r\n For the five beef exporting countries profiled in this report, improved market access was the main driver of real export revenue growth (in 2000 US dollar terms) between 2000 and 2014. Other contributing drivers include changes in export supply costs, exchange rate movements and growth in demand for beef. \r\n\r\n Three forward-looking scenarios assess the potential change to export growth from 2014 to 2030 from changes in domestic and international operating environments. These include: the removal of Argentine agricultural export requirements; improved market access for South American beef; and improvements in transport infrastructure for Brazil and Australia. \r\n\r\n To maintain its export competitiveness, Australia will need to: 1. improve productivity growth both on and off the farm \r\n2. continue to target premium markets and improve market access in order to be responsive to changes in the market \r\n3. maintain a production system that ensures its status as a clean and green beef producer so that it will be able to distinguish itself on quality when it cannot compete on price with lower-cost exporters. \r\n",

The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22(1) of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2003, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the compliance of public authorities with the Act. In 2014, this was reported in the State of the WA public sector 2014 - Measuring up.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 PID survey collected information on public interest disclosures received during the 2013/14 financial year, and activities undertaken to comply with the PID Act. The survey was sent to chief employees of all public authorities, including public sector entities, local governments, public universities, other entities listed in Schedule 1 of the Public Sector Management Act 1994 (PSM Act), and government boards and committees. The PID survey questions are incorporated in the public sector entity survey for public sector entities (Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state) with more than 20 staff.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, 86 entities completed the public sector entity survey and 245 authorities completed the PID survey (24 public sector entities with less than 20 staff, 68 government boards and committees, 128 local governments, 4 public universities and 21 other Schedule 1 PSM Act entities).\r\n\r\nTwo files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission PID survey 2014 data.xls – individual authority responses to the PID survey with a question key and response key. \r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission PID survey 2014 data.sav – individual authority responses to the PID survey, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. \r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of PID survey data is available in the State of the WA public sector 2014 - Measuring up. \r\n",

In the current assessment for NSW, the HEVAE consists of four key criteria which include diversity, distinctiveness, naturalness and vital habitat. Therefore, the HEVAE instream value layer is a combination of four individual criterion layers. The final or overall HEVAE score is determined for each River Style® reach. This is calculated by adding together the final scores for each criterion (Naturalness, Diversity, Distinctiveness and Vital Habitat). This score is then standardised by dividing by the maximum combined HEVAE score for a whole catchment's river reaches to provide an even spread of score outcomes between 0 (lowest) and 1 (highest). The distinctiveness value criteria of HEVAE were updated in 2018 by including the predicted threatened fish species distribution data (MaxEnt modelled data) provided by DPI Fisheries. The final or overall HEVAE scores where then recalculated after this process.\nPrevious SEED service moved from 10.7 to 11. 1 Portal.

    "title": "HWS2018 Subcatchments with 2016 vegetation metrics for Riparian and Stream Bed",
    "description": "Data represents vegetation coverage within the riparian zone for waterways across Melbourne Water’s region. This layer was developed by GraceGIS as part of vegetation statistics extraction for each riparian zone and stream bed for each of the subcatchments. The data was developed as part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). The primary purpose of this layer is for reporting and target setting. This includes setting and reporting on targets and performance objectives relating to vegetation coverage.Dataset was created using 1. Latest MW Drainage Network to prepare HWS stream network layer. 2. Seamless polygons were created for the stream bed: ISC 2010 streambed data and a 2 metre buffer from the network was used to develop a complete streambed layer across the Melbourne Water region. 3. Buffer polygons at 20 metres and 10 metres from the streambed representing riparian zone outside Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) area and within UGB respectively. 4. HWS Vegetation Streambed Riparian (2016) layer for these riparian and stream beds has been assembled. 5. Subc level stats are derived as detailed above.Attribute level metadata can be viewed hereNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "This dataset presents the estimates of the internal and overseas migration statistics of Australia by age by Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) following the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The dataset spans from the 2016-17 financial year up to the 2019-20 financial year.\nOverseas migration is the movement of people from overseas to Australia's sub-state areas and vice-versa.  It cannot be directly measured and is estimated by breaking down overseas migrant arrivals and departures at the state level to sub-state areas, using information from the most recent Census. The state-level overseas migration data is sourced from Department of Home Affairs processing systems, visa information, and incoming passenger cards, and is published in National, state and territory population.\nInternal migration is the movement of people across a specified boundary within Australia involving a change in place of usual residence. It cannot be directly measured and is instead estimated using administrative data. The movement of people between and within Australia's states and territories cannot be directly measured and is estimated using administrative data. Internal migration is estimated based on a combination of Census data (usual address one year ago), Medicare change of address data (provided by Services Australia), and Department of Defence records (for military personnel only). \nThe Medicare source data is assigned to a state or territory and GCCSA for a person's departure and arrival locations, based on the postcodes of their residential addresses as registered with Medicare. Postcodes are assigned wholly to a state/territory and GCCSA based on best fit. Where a postcode is split across areas, it is assigned to the area that contains the majority of that postcode's population.\nFor more information please visit the Regional population methodology.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

    "title": "Groundwater use of riparian vegetation along Cooper Creek",
    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from source data referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. This investigation sought to investigate the water balance of the alluvium of the Cooper Creek using the actual evapotranspiration from MODIS-Landsat blended CMRSET. Previous research has shown that the river red gum and coolibah trees in the riparian zone are using both soil moisture and groundwater, whereas the rest of the floodplain vegetation is limited to using soil moisture fed from rainfall and overbank flooding. This allows us to classify areas based on their actual evapotranspiration and therefore water sources: open water > riparian areas > floodplain > rain fed areas. Transmission losses are very high in Cooper Creek with 81% of the water flowing into the system from the Barcoo and Thompson rivers lost by the time it reaches the Qld/SA border. This water is either lost to the floodplain through overbank flooding or to groundwater recharge. There is no regional freshwater resource and the freshwater lenses around waterholes are consumed by the riparian vegetation within hundreds of metres of the waterholes. Using the remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration data enables vegetation water use to be split by water source. For the period 2000-2018, 77% of water lost from Cooper Creek was lost to the floodplain where it supports the pasture growth critical to the pastoral industry. The remaining 23% was lost to evapotranspiration by the riparian vegetation or as open water evaporation in waterholes. The waterholes act as recharge features of the landscape while Cooper Creek is in flood, through scouring of the bed of the channels, and then self-seal when the velocity of the flow decreases. When sealed, there is no leakage to groundwater. Local-scale recharge can be inferred for each waterhole using a groundwater balance based on transpiration of groundwater from the riparian zone vegetation. Of the 80 waterholes that hold water more than 95% of the time, the calculated recharge rate was between 130 and 970 mm/year over the area of the waterhole. These recharge estimates suggest recharge occurs through the bed of the channels, as well as from the waterholes, the area-weighted average recharge rate for these 80 waterholes was 260 mm/year. \n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe Lineage field lists the parents of this dataset. The steps involved in creating this dataset were: (1) classify annual evapotranspiration dataset into four classes based on the magnitude of the AET - Open water > riparian vegetation > floodplain vegetation > dryland areas; (2) calculate the mode of the classified landscape class from the 18 years of data (classed_AET_TS_ann_mode_clipped_FP.tif); (3) calculate the number of times a pixel was classified as riparian vegetation (sumrip.tif); (4) calculate a water balance at the landscape scale (WB at landscape scale.xls); and (5) calculate a water balance at the scale of a waterhole (WB at waterhole scale.xls). More information on how this dataset was created can be found in the journal paper: \r\nCrosbie RS, Holland KL and McVicar TR (in prep) Actual evapotranspiration in the Cooper Creek floodplain: transmission losses and groundwater recharge.

    "description": "A study of the response of phytoplankton to rainfall in Sydney Harbour, on the 29th of October 2004, is reported here. Sydney Harbour is an important port and recreational region for the city of Sydney. Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for the understanding of how salinity manifests itself in the landscape and how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially defines areas of similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of HGL determination relies on the integration of a number of factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith depth, and climate; an understanding of the differences in salinity development; and the impacts (land salinity/salt load/water electrical conductivity) in landscapes. Information sources such as soils maps, site characterisation, salinity site mapping, hydrogeological conditions and surface and groundwater data are combined to develop standard templates for each HGL. The focus of this package is the Goulburn Study Area. It comprises four volumes - Volume 1: project background, regional setting, methodologies, interpretations, conclusions, glossary and references; Volume 2: HGL templates, and information associated with the use of the HGL templates; Volume 3: maps and digital spatial data developed for the project, including derivative maps to assist in land management decision making; and Volume 4: background information relevant to land management for rural and urban salinity in the Goulburn Study Area. This includes information on salinity management from the perspectives of land use design, scales and types of management, landscape function, management strategies, actions and outcomes, as well as land use to be avoided.\n\nSpatial resolution for this product is 1:100 000.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced. This has been calculated with the number of selected females who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nInduction of labour is a set of procedures (pharmacological and/or instrumental) to start the uterus contracting and begin the process of labour.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "We undertook a biological data acquisition program as part of the transit of the R.V. Southern Surveyor between Darwin and Cairns 15-24 October 2012. The overarching aim of this program was to use an ROV and benthic sled to collect benthic marine information and specimens for biodiversity and biodiscovery research in areas previously mapped by Geoscience Australia during survey GA-276, including a bank (Area I) and terrace/hole feature within the proposed Wessel Islands CMR (Area II). This study focuses on sessile invertebrates such as sponges and octocorals due to their ecological importance as habitat providers and their chemical importance as sources of marine natural products and medicines.\n\nIn less than 24 hours of sampling effort, survey SS2012/t07 resulted in 261 voucher specimens which will be used for biodiversity and natural products research.  A total of 49 samples are to be lodged at the ABL, and samples with weights larger than 300 g will be sent to the NCI for screening of active compounds against cancer and HIV. Sponges were the most abundant group collected based on both biomass (~ 139 kg) and number of voucher specimens (93),  followed by cnidarians (30 kg, 73 vouchers), particularly hard corals (23 kg, 11 vouchers). As expected the top of the bank in Area I had a seemingly diverse and abundant sessile invertebrate community, with consistent patchy occurrence of sponges, octocorals, and hard corals. The terrace at in Area II supports moderate densities of sponges and octocorals, while the adjacent deep hole at ~ 100 m seems to be covered with muddy gravel and supports scattered mobile and sedentary invertebrates, of which crinoids dominate, as well as skates and numerous small demersal fish.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the number of distinct specialist homeless services clients by client type, sex and age group. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has set suppressed values (\".\") as Null.",

    "description": "A series of geophysical traverses by the Atlantis II across the Argo Abyssal Plain, together with coring at a number of selected localities has provided new information on sedimentary and tectonic processes in this region of the northeast Indian Ocean. Isopach maps prepared from the seismic profiles show that sediment thicknesses crudely parallel the bathymetry. The presence of some diapirs in the Argo Abyssal Plain was indicated. It was not possible to say from the present program whether the probable diapirs are salt or mud-cored. A diverse group of cores were obtained from a variety of sites including siliceous clays from below the CCD, calcareous oozes from above the CCD, calcareous clays (showing evidence of abundant sulphate reduction) from a fore-arc basin site, and manganese nodules from an abyssal site. In addition, hyaloclastites from the Joey Rise area (north of the Exmouth Plateau), suggest that the Joey Rise, and possibly also the Roo Rise, are underlain by basaltic material. A sample of basalt was also recovered from the outer part of the Exmouth Plateau.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2002.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The statewide severity map has standardised classes to allow comparison of different fires across the landscape. The FESM severity classes include: unburnt, extent only (grass fires), low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy), moderate severity (partial canopy scorch), high severity (complete canopy scorch, partial canopy consumption), extreme (full canopy consumption).\n\nThis dataset represents the 2023/24 fire year including all wildfires and hazard reductions &gt;10ha with a fire start date between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024.",

The Indigenous use and rights information was sourced from multiple Indigenous land ownership, land management and land rights datasets from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies. The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) dataset. The dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR). The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are:\r\n1.\tIndigenous owned and managed;\r\n2.\tIndigenous managed;\r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and\r\n4.\tOther Special rights.\r\nThese categories align with the reporting requirements of the SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.\r\n",

    "description": "Supporting the community to strengthen social cohesion and belonging by collecting, protecting and celebrating NSW's stories, artefacts, content, arts, culture and heritage experiences. \nNSW is home to the oldest and most distinctive cultural institutions in the country. Visitation rates to our cultural institutions have surged past our pre-COVID records, with the Australian Museum recording the highest visitation rate in its almost 200-year history and more than 2 million visitors to the new expanded Art Gallery of NSW campus Naala Badu and Naala Nura. Expanding access to online engagement has been hugely significant too, with more than 21 million views globally of Sydney Opera House videos (in addition to its 10 million visitors to the site each year)  and 4.6 million sessions on the State Library's website. Investment in the Powerhouse (MAAS) sites will support sharing its exhibitions with more people across NSW. The Museums of History NSW experienced growing visitation across their sites, which bring history to life through diverse voices and viewpoints.  \nNote on the data: \nThe data provided here reflects a reproduction of onsite visitation figures that have been published in the respective cultural institutions annual report. The data does not reflect offsite engagement activities (e.g. offsite public programs and touring activity). It also relates only to the primary site of visitation, for example, The State Library of NSW helps administer all public libraries in NSW (under the Library Act 1939) and visitation to these local libraries is not included in the above State Library visitation figure. In 2023-24, there were over 26 million visits to NSW public libraries. In that year, $40.89m of the State Library’s budget was provided for public library funding to local councils.\nEach individual annual report includes supporting information such as closures or attendance limitations due to revitalisation, refurbishment, COVID measures, and COVID recovery measures such as free admission. \nEach cultural institution has its own methodology and categorisation of onsite visitation, and attendance rates are not directly comparable.\nData gaps: \nFor 2018-19 only, the State Library published a combined online and onsite visitation figure. The data for the State Library for this year included above is on-site visitation only, which was sources directly from the State Library (i.e. not their annual report).\nThe Museums of History NSW was created in 2022, incorporating stewardship responsibilities for the State Archives and for significant museums, houses and collections. Previous data from the annual reports of the State Archives and Records Authority of NSW (SARA) (reading room and onsite programming) and Sydney Living Museums (total onsite visitation including grounds) from 2018-19 to 2021-22 have been included for comparison before 2022.

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and envirionmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nThis dataset contains 8 extent types as follows:\n\n1 in 10 (10%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 20 (5%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 25 (4%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 50 (2%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood level contour\nDesignated flood event level contour\n1 in 200 (0.5%) AEP flood level contour\n1 in 500 (0.2%) AEP flood level contour\n\nThis dataset describes how flood levels vary across the floodplain for various sized flood events. Flood levels are referenced to the Australian Height Datum (AHD) \n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River - Brookton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nFitzroy River – Fitzroy Crossing Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGascoyne River - Carnarvon Townsite and the Lower Gascoyne (contains both pre and post-stage 2 Carnarvon flood mitigation works mapping: refer to COMMENTS field)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGreenough River – Indian Ocean to Walkaway.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nKatanning Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLower Collie River, Brunswick River and Wellesley River - Greater Bunbury.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Donnybrook Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSerpentine River, Peel, Birrega &amp; Oaklands Drains, Murray River and the Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary - Peel Inlet to the confluence of the Dandalup-South Dandalup-North Dandalup Rivers and south to the Darling Scarp via Pinjarra (Murray River), Peel Inlet to Black Lake (Nambellup Brook) and Geogrup Lake to South Western Highway (Serpentine River), north to Wellard (Peel Main Drain) and to Wungong Brook (Birrega Drain).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Perth - Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River). Tributaries include Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Ellen Brook, Helena River, Henley Brook, Jane Brook, St Leonards Creek, Susannah Brook (Swan River) and Southern River/ Wungong Brook (Canning River).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor further information on flooding and floodplain management in Western Australia please refer to our Water Facts publications: Flooding in Western Australia (Water facts 13) and Floodplain Management (Water facts 14).\n\nThis information is available at the following addresses: \nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf https://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's life time. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated values of the Total Income as a category of the estimates of Personal Income for Small Areas ABS release. The data spans over the financial years of 2010-11 to 2014-15 and is aggregated to the 2016 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries.\nThis release presents regional data on the number of income earners, amounts they receive, and the distribution of income for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 financial years. An improved geocoding process has been introduced for this release. As such, previously released estimates for the 2010-11 and 2012-13 financial year have been superseded. The following personal income categories are provided in this census release:\n\n\nEmployee Income\n\n\nOwn Unincorporated Business Income\n\n\nInvestment Income\n\n\nSuperannuation Income\n\n\nOther Income (Income not allocatable to any other categories)\n\n\nTotal Income (Sum of previous categories)\nThese statistics provide insights into the nature of regional economies and the economic well-being of the people who live there. The data has been sourced from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and is presented with the updated 2016 editions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGS):  Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2); Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3); Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4); Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) and Local Government Area (LGA).\n\n\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note:\n\n\nWhen interpreting these results, it should be noted that some low income earners, for example those receiving Government pensions and allowances, or those who earned below the tax free threshold, may not be present in the data, as they may not be required to lodge personal tax forms. Other individuals may not lodge a tax return even if required, therefore care should be taken in interpreting the data as well as comparing the data in this publication with other income data produced by the ABS.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, a confidentialisation process called perturbation has been applied to the data. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics while maximising the range of information that can be released.\n\n\nWhere data is not available or not for publication, the record has been set to a null value.\n\n",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.0) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n  The site is located on a low lying plain dominated by Mitchell Grass (<em>gen. Astrebla</em>). Elevation of the site is close to 250m and mean annual precipitation at a nearby Bureau of Meteorology site is 640mm. Maximum temperatures range from 28.4°C (in June/ July) to 39.1°C (in December), while minimum temperatures range from 11.2°C (in July) to 24.4°C (in December).The instrument mast is 5 meters tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall and net radiation are measured. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.Ancillary measurements taken at the site include LAI, leaf-scale physiological properties (gas exchange, leaf isotope ratios, N and chlorophyll concentrations), vegetation optical properties and soil physical properties. Airborne based remote sensing (Lidar and hyperspectral measurements) was carried out across the transect in September 2008. Biomass Harvest - mean live biomass: 0.00 gm-2 (standard error: 0.00) , mean standing dead biomass: 163.42 gm-2 (standard error: 16.73), mean litter biomass: 148.99 gm-2 (standard error: 21.32), total mean biomass: 312.40 gm-2 (standard error: 30.80), Soil- Clay: 14.47% (volume &lt;1µm), Silt: 51.23% (volume &lt;1µm), Sand: 34.30% (volume &lt;1µm), Sand (&gt;1 µm): 1.02% (total weight).",

For more information view the About prescribed burns page, or view the Schedule of Prescribed Burns.\nThe SBMP requires regional fire management plans (RFMPs) to provide a link between the strategy of this plan and the more detailed bushfire operational plans (BOPs). RFMPs will be updated to cover the entire ACT to reflect boundaries based on bushfire risk and geography. RFMPs detail the five-year program (2014–19) of work for fuel reduction, access and infrastructure in the ACT. RFMPs for 2019–24 will be prepared during the life of the SBMP.\nThe ACT Emergency Services Commissioner (the Commissioner) is responsible for approval of RFMPs. They will be reviewed as required to reflect significant changes. These may include unplanned bushfires, which may provide strategic advantages or changes to the location or extent of assets – for example, the development of new estates.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nThe ACT Government is providing this bushfire management map for information purposes only.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a N-S transect, running from Red Point in the north, to Creswell in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 9 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

Count of responses and persons in the following categories with corresponding ancestry: both parents born overseas, father born overseas, mother born overseas, both parents born in Australia, parents birthplace not stated. The list of ancestries consists of the most common 30 Ancestry responses reported in the 2011 Census. This is a multi-response dataset and therefore the total responses count will not equal the total persons count. If two responses from one person are categorised in the 'Other' category only one response is counted. If either or both parents birthplace is not stated then a single response is tallied in the 'not stated' category. The data is by SA1 2016 boundaries. Periodicity: 5-Yearly. \nNote: There are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.\nFor more information visit the data source: http://www.abs.gov.au/census. ",

The 2022 floor space and employment survey was the fourth full survey within the current City of Sydney local area boundaries. Previous surveys were undertaken in 2007, 2012 and 2017.    The business establishment dataset contains the point location of each business establishment within a building from the 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022 floor space and employment survey.    Each business establishment is classified using a composite city-based industry classification to report on the various industry sectors across the local area, categorised by the main function of a business. The classifications are based on an expanded version of the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) 2006.   For more information on the floor space and employment survey, visit the City of Sydney website.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2006 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

Fire Management Zones form an integral part of the ACT Government’s approach to mitigating bushfire risk.\n\nThe zones established include <strong>Inner and Outer Asset Protection Zones, Strategic Firefighting Advantage Zones, Landscape Fire Management Zones, Agricultural Fire Management Zones and Aboriginal Fire Management Zones</strong>.\n\nFire Management Zones are the link between the SBMP and the on-ground implementation of fuel management practices and are defined by the ACT Bushfire Management Standards.&nbsp;\n\nFire Management Zones are reviewed annually to ensure they are kept up to date with the growing urban edge of the ACT.

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.3) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.   \nThe Tumbarumba flux station is located in the Bago State Forest in south eastern New South Wales. It was established in 2000 and is managed by CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research. The forest is classified as wet sclerophyll, the dominant species is Eucalyptus delegatensis, and average tree height is 40m. Elevation of the site is 1200m and mean annual precipitation is 1000mm. The Bago and Maragle State Forests are adjacent to the south west slopes of southern New South Wales and the 48,400 ha of native forest have been managed for wood production for over 100 years. The instrument mast is 70m tall. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide are measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation. Profiles of temperature, humidity and CO2 are measured at seven levels within the canopy. Soil moisture content is measured using Time Domain reflectometry, while soil heat fluxes and temperature are also measured. Hyper-spectral radiometric measurements are being used to determine canopy leaf-level properties. The Tumbarumba flux station is supported by TERN and the DCCEE through the ACCSP.

    "description": "The ACT Parks &amp; Conservation Service (PCS) manages about\n73% or roughly 187,000 ha across the ACT and the Googong Foreshore, NSW. PCS\nimplements an extensive ongoing bushfire fuel management program. Fuel\nmanagement can reduce fire behaviour and severity, improve firefighter safety,\nincrease the probability of suppression and reduce the impacts of bushfires on\nnatural and built assets. The three means for managing bushfire fuels are\nreduction, removal and conversion to a less flammable type, and are achieved by\nundertaking the slashing, grazing, physical removal, and/or prescribed burns\n\n\nThese activities are described in a yearly program of work\nreferred to as the <a href=\"https://www.act.gov.au/open/bushfire-management-plans\">Bushfire Operations Plan</a> (BOP), which sets out activities to meet the\nrequirements of the <a href=\"https://esa.act.gov.au/community-information/publications/sbmp/\">Strategic\nBushfire Management Plan for the ACT</a> (SBMP). The <a href=\"https://www.actmapi.act.gov.au/\">Bushfire Map</a> shows the Environment, Planning &amp;\nSustainable Development Directorate (EPSDD) Bushfire Operations Plan (BOP) for\nthe current financial year.\n\n\nThe EPSDD BOP is derived from the 5-year Regional Fire\nManagement Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The EPSDD BOP details\nthe specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and\ninfrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current\nfinancial; year, in accordance with the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan\n(SBMP).",
