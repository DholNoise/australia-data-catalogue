    "description": "Remnant vegetation mapping for the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion, Metropolitan and Peel Region Scheme areas in 2015. Part of a suite of polygon datasets that best represent remnants of original pre-1750 vegetation across the mapped areas as at 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2024. The polygons represent interpreted areas of vegetation using current and historical digital aerial photography (1953-present) sourced from State Government repositories and other commercial products e.g. Digital globe, ESRI wayback imagery and Google. Simplified condition of the vegetation has been attributed to some polygons.\n\nThe mapped area covers the Metropolitan and Peel Region Schemes, the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion as defined in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia V 7.1 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2025) and the Swan Coastal Plain vegetation complexes (DBCA-046) (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2016).\n\nFor further information refer to Explanatory Report titled 'Swan Coastal Plain and Perth-Peel remnant native vegetation extent mapping in 2000-2020 (5 yearly interval) and the year 2024.pdf'",

The tables present age- and sex-specific counts and rates by cause of death, along with other summary measures.\r\n\r\nGRIM books are available for all causes of death combined and 55 other cause of death groupings. They span different years for different causes of death, depending on the data available. GRIM books for some causes of death start at 1907 and they are the only national electronic tabulations of deaths data by cause registered before 1964. Data from 1964 onwards are sourced from the AIHW [National Mortality Database](https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-data/our-data-collections/national-mortality-database).

    "description": "Landsat satellite imagery is used to derive woody vegetation extent products that discriminate between forest, sparse woody and non-woody land cover across a time series from 1988 to 2022. A forest is defined as woody vegetation with a minimum 20 per cent canopy cover, at least 2 metres high and a minimum area of 0.2 hectares. Note that this product is not filtered to the 0.2ha criteria for forest to allow for flexibility in different use cases. Filtering to remove areas less than 0.2ha is undertaken in downstream processing for the purposes of Australia's National Inventory Reports. Sparse woody is defined as woody vegetation with a canopy cover between 5-19 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe three-class classification (forest, sparse woody and non-woody) supersedes the two-class classification (forest and non-forest) from 2016. The new classification is produced using the same approach in terms of time series processing (conditional probability networks) as the two-class method, to detect woody vegetation cover. The three-class algorithm better encompasses the different types of woody vegetation across the Australian landscape.\r\n\r\nUnlike previous versions of the National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation data releases where 35 tiles have been released concurrently as part of the product, only the 25 southern tiles were supplied in the initial v7.0 release in June 2023. The 10 northern tiles have been released in July 2024 as v7.1 as a supplement to the initial product release to complete the standard 35 tiles. Please see the National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation data metadata pdf (Version 7.1 - 2022 release) for more information.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC13) was collected from a depth of 1482 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~90cm depth and MIS 6 at ~340cm corresponding to heavier 18-O values and other measured parameters.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for September 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.  The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.  Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.  The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.\nThe 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database (http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/data-applications/reference-databases/stratigraphic-units.html), incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.  The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.\nThe first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.  Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.  In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.",

    "title": "QED - School Disciplinary Absences by School (Point) 2013-2017",
    "description": "This dataset presents the location of School Disciplinary Absences for Queensland state schools by year, semester and absence type. The data spans the years of 2013-2017.\nState schools are required to report School Disciplinary Absences (SDA) for the school year in their School Annual Report. There are 4 categories of SDA: short suspension (1-5 days), long suspension (6-20 days), suspensions with proposal/recommendation for exclusion and cancellations of enrolment. A student may be suspended or excluded from a state school or schools because of disobedience, misconduct or other conduct that is prejudicial to the good order and management of the school. A student may also be excluded from a state school for contravention of a Behaviour Improvement Condition. Suspension prohibits a student from attending an educational institution for a nominated period of time (from 1-5 days or 6-20 days). Decisions to suspend a student are made by individual state school principals.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the Queensland Department of Education - School Disciplinary Absences.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled this data using the Queensland Department of Education - State and Non State School Listings.\n\n\nData is made available through a AURIN-QCIF-RIDL collaboration.\n\n\nGeometries modified from State and Non-State School Listings 2012-2018, as provided by QED. For facilities which closed prior to 2012, including Richlands State School [1121], Lindum State School [1682], Wynnum North State school [221], Wynnum Central State School [87] and Hemmant State School [30], data cannot be represented spatially.\n\n\nOn 5 November 2010, state school principals were given the power to exclude students from their school. They may recommend the decision to their supervisor if they believe it is inappropriate for them to make the decision.\n\n\nThe information is displayed in terms of aggregate counts of incidents. These data do not represent the outcomes of any related appeal decisions.\n\n",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Central Coast catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2050 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin.Areas of risk are based on groundwater levels and air photo\r\ninterpretation. The merged data, at a nominal scale of 1:250 000, show actual\r\nareas where dryland salinity or water-tables less than 2 metres have been\r\nmeasured. For the extent map, every delineated area is underpinned by either\r\nair photo data or by one or more groundwater bores. Therefore, the area at\r\nrisk is regarded as conservative due to limitations in the spatial coverage of\r\nair photo and bore data.  number of techniques to spatially extrapolate these\r\ndata to infer potential areas at risk were trialed but were considered\r\nscientifically or statistically inadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on\r\nareas at risk having groundwater levels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment\r\nbased on groundwater less than 5 m and rising was considered inappropriate.\r\nTotal areas affected with groundwater less than 5 m and rising have been\r\npresented, but only for improved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a03.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for June 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The results are displayed as actual travel speeds for each of the routes individually in a separate dataset \"Travel Speed in Metropolitan Adelaide \", as well as aggregated to form a suite of travel time performance indicators. The aggregation is done by breaking each route down into a series of 'links' and weighting travel times for each link by the average number of vehicles per hour travelling on that link.

This can be for many reasons; the road pavement has been damaged, or stress has occurred on a bridge which requires a limit to be placed on it. \r\n\r\nA load limit sign specifies the permitted load limit, the permitted axle load limit or the maximum dimensions of a vehicle or combination.  A vehicle or combination may not pass the load limit sign if the mass or dimension is greater than stipulated on the sign. \r\n\r\nThere are provisions in the Vehicle and Traffic (Vehicle Operations) Regulations 2014 which allow the Transport Commission to issue a permit enabling the vehicle or combination to bypass the load limit sign.

    "description": "This data set shows the average attendance rate for students in NSW government schools by Statistical Area 4 (SA4).\nData notes\n\n\n2021 data is not comparable to previous years due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to calculation rules to align with ACARA’s national standards (version 3) and changes to the way attendance data is transferred into the department’s centralised data warehouse. Please refer to 2021 Semester 1 student attendance factsheet for more information.\n\n\n2020 data is not provided because students were encouraged to learn from home for several weeks in Semester 1. Please refer to the factsheet on The effects of COVID-19 on attendance during Semester 1 2020 for more information.\n\n\nIn 2018 NSW government schools implemented the national standards for student attendance data reporting. This resulted in a fall in attendance rates for most schools due to the inclusion of part day absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation. Data from 2018 onwards is not comparable with earlier years.\n\n\nSchools for Specific Purposes (SSPs) are only included from 2021. Prior to this SSP attendance data was not collected centrally.\n\n\nThe attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student days attended by full-time students in Years 1–10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended in Semester 1. Figures are aligned with the National Report on Schooling and the My School website.\n\n\nSA4 refers to the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 Statistical Area 4 (SA4) – 2021.\n\n\n‘Other Territories’ has been assigned to Norfolk Island Central School, which operated under the responsibility of NSW Department of Education between 2018-2021.\n\n\nData source\nSemester 1 Return of Absences Collection\nData quality statement\nThe Attendance Data Quality Statement addresses the quality of the Attendance dataset using the dimensions outlined in the NSW Department of Education's data quality management framework: institutional environment, relevance, timeliness, accuracy, coherence, interpretability and accessibility. It provides an overview of the dataset's quality and highlights any known data quality issues.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February and March 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS032008.\n\nDeparted: \tPort Adelaide, South Australia, February 28, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, March 17, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

Clear separation of resources it not readily available.\r\n\r\nNote that New South Wales had Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal heritage combined into one entity in 2013/14 and data is unable to be separated beyond this time frame. \r\n\r\nWhere data for a jurisdiction or year is absent (null) the data was not available or not provided.\r\n\r\nFigure HER15, HER27 and HER32 in the heritage theme.\r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/heritage/topic/2016/identification-types-heritage#heritage-figure-HER15\r\n\r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/heritage/topic/2016/inputs-financial-resources#heritage-figure-HER27\r\n\r\nhttps://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/heritage/topic/2016/inputs-human-resources#heritage-figure-HER32",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems.The data spans the months from January 2020 to June 2021 and includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem (SA3 code 70203) and East Arnhem (SA3 code 70204) are combined in the original data. AURIN has assigned the results for these regions to the boundary of Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem and excluded the boundary of East Arnhem from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2017 car parking event data there are 3,858 records where the parking event goes into 2018 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.13GB, 35.9 million rows)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, divided by the number of females having their second birth whose first birth was by caesarean section and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who are having a singleton for their second birth and whose first birth was by caesarean section.\n\n\nExcluded are those females whose second birth is a multiple birth, those who are not having their second birth, and those who are having their second birth and whose first birth was a vaginal birth.\n\n\nData for Victoria in 2007 to 2009 were not available.\n\n\nData for WA in 2013 is not published as complete data due to only half a year being reported.\n\n\nFrom 2014, Caesarean section at most recent previous birth indicator data item was introduced into the Perinatal NMDS. Although not an NMDS/DSS item prior to 2014, data items appear to match the data element developed by NPDDC, Caesarean section indicator (last previous birth).\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "Improving water quality in the coastal zone is vital for sustaining the industries, communities and ecosystems dependent on coastal catchments. This project will provide national community benefits across several levels, including direct benefits to rural and regional communities. At the regional level, the project will inform policy makers and managers on how to balance environmental protection with competing development demands. At the national level, it will provide tools and a structured process for managers to assess water quality impacts in the coastal zone. It will be particularly useful for guiding protection and enhancement of coastal environments under pressure from urban development and land use intensification. \n\nThis project will apply and integrate water quality models and economic assessment techniques to assist policy makers and catchment managers balance competing development pressures and environmental concerns in coastal catchments. The research is fundamental to underpinning the sustainable management of coastal catchments which provide major economic, environmental and community benefits. The project will provide robust tools to predict water quality impacts under a range of conditions and it will develop techniques for the economic valuation of market and non-market impacts. The project will demonstrate the integration of water quality and economic modelling and how it can influence policy and investment in conservation and remediation.\n\nThe project is focused in the Eurobodalla Shire on the south coast of NSW, Australia.",

    "description": "Abstract from: 'An inventory of present glaciers on Heard Island and their historical variation' by Andrew Ruddell.\r\n\r\n      Heard Island is a large ice-covered volcanic cone situated in the south Indian Ocean. Its location enables unique climatic information to be obtained from a very remote and predominantly maritime region. Past studies show that while some glaciers have undergone major recession since the late 1940s, others, such as large non-calving glaciers, have shown little change in extent. The island is usually cloud covered and this has hampered aerial and ground based surveys. Using SPOT satellite imagery acquired in 1988 and supplemented by aerial photography in 1987 and a digital elevation model derived from 1997 Radarsat imagery, an inventory of glacier extent is provided and this indicates that there are a total of 29 glaciated basins (41 termini), with an area of 257 km2 and an estimated volume of 14.2 km3. The satellite imagery is used to rectify earlier estimates of glacier extent based on aerial photography in 1947 and 1980. Between 1947 and 1988 the glaciated area had decreased by 11% and volume by 12%. Approximately half of this occurred during the 1980s.\r\n\r\n      A variety of historical records have been compiled and these provide evidence of glacier behaviour since the mid-1800s when they were at their greatest extent during the recorded period. The elevation range of a glacier is a good indication of glacier hypsometry and its sensitivity to mass balance and climate variations. Glaciers such as the Gotley are of large elevation range and high mass turnover. Such glaciers show little sensitivity to climate variations as they lose much of their ice through calving into the sea rather than surface melt. Glaciers of low elevation range such as those on the Laurens Peninsula are especially sensitive to climate change. Glaciers of this type indicate that while minor decadal fluctuations have occurred in the period from at least 1902 to the 1950s, the recession of many glaciers during the past 50 years has been unprecedented. The glacier variations correlate with observed temperature records.\r\n\r\n      Observations of occasional volcanic eruptions since the 1880s indicate that most activity is related to lava flows from Mawson Peak and fumerole activity on its upper southwestern slope. This activity appears to have had little effect on the Gotley and Lied glaciers.",

    "description": "Vectorized version of the Land Monitor Salinity Extent – South West of Western Australia 2010 dataset.\n\nSalinity mapped in raster format with 25-m pixels. The Land Monitor salinity mapping process uses satellite imagery, high-resolution topographic data, ground information and ancillary GIS data sets to map areas of severely salt-affected land identified in consecutive satellite (Landsat TM) scenes (Furby et al 2010). To update the 1990 and 1998 estimates, the spatial-temporal methodology was re-applied using the same approach but took advantage of the latest data and improved computational resources (Caccetta et al 2022). Any changes in the extent of salt affected land detected by Land Monitor in the updated salinity mapping are most likely within the severe salinity class and may represent either expansions of this class of salinity or improvements in the condition of severely salt affected land or in the reduction of commission errors (compared to the original mapping).\n\nThis data has converted the salt effected areas to a vector geodatabase. Additional post processing to remove urban areas has been applied.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "The NSW Carbon Monitoring project is a collaboration between the Natural Resources Commission of NSW and Mullion Group to develop a spatial time-series dataset of forest carbon history for the state of NSW at ~25m resolution. The project used FLINTpro software to integrate historical environmental and land management data to model carbon stock and fluxes. Aboveground biomass refers to the amount of carbon stored within aboveground forest components (pools) which includes leaves, branches, bark and stems. Belowground biomass refers to the amount of carbon stored within belowground forest components (pools) which includes coarse and fine roots. Dead Organic Matter refers to the amount of carbon stored within dead forest components (pools) which includes leaf litter, branch litter, bark litter, stem litter, and dead roots. Carbon stored within soil and harvested wood products is not included within any of these datasets.\n\nThis dataset has been superseeded by <a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/b9eab336-0ccc-43cd-9d44-e1e6207a2575\">NSW Forest Carbon Stock - Aboveground, Belowground and Dead Organic Matter Carbon Mass 1990-2021</a>",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are obese. Adults were classified as obese if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

The data shows business establishments with their trading name, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, location and CLUE block and small area allocation.

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Southern Rivers catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

    "description": "Resourcing Australia’s Prosperity is a 35-year initiative, led by Geoscience Australia, to enhance knowledge of Australia’s&nbsp;geology and groundwater systems.&nbsp;The groundwater project under the Initiative&nbsp;enhances understanding, management, and sustainable use of Australia’s groundwater by assessing groundwater systems, their connectivity and relationships with other natural resources across the continent. The groundwater project is taking national groundwater mapping to the next level and builds on foundational work under the recently completed Exploring for the Future Program.\n\nThe groundwater project comprises three key components. National 3D Groundwater Systems Mapping is enhancing National 3D geology models to incorporate hydrostratigraphy and build consistency in national groundwater databases through multi-agency collaboration. The National Hydrogeological Inventory provides a unified, multi-tier repository of hydrogeological data, ensuring consistency and accessibility for groundwater studies and management. The Groundwater Atlas&nbsp;integrates 3D models and hydrogeological data for priority regions, presented as a map compendium. The groundwater Atlas is designed to present groundwater conceptual models in a visually engaging manner for a broad audience.\n\nBy delivering these outcomes, the project strengthens Australia’s capacity to sustainably manage groundwater resources for current and future generations. It supports the clean energy transition by providing critical groundwater data, enhances national groundwater information access for government, industry, and communities, and improves data coverage and model confidence across state and territory jurisdictions. \n\nOngoing engagement with the Australian and International groundwater community will be critical to design and deliver groundwater products that meet the needs of all Australians.\n\nPresented at the 52nd Congress of International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH2025)",

    "description": "Advancing genetic solutions for crop protection in Australian wheat: identifying novel and optimal combinations of APR resistance genes to Septoria tritici blotch. \nWheat is one of the most important crops in Australia, providing food, feed and export income. However, wheat production is threatened by various diseases, such as Septoria tritici blotch (STB), a foliar disease of wheat caused by the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. This disease is prevalent in medium-high rainfall zones of Australia. If left unmanaged, STB can result in yield losses of up to 50% and traditional control by fungicides is estimated to cost the industry $121 million per year is less effective due to fungicide resistance evolving in Australia to some common triazoles and strobilurin.\nOne way to manage this disease is to use wheat varieties resistant to STB. However, 10 out of 17 genes tested for adult plant resistance (APR) performance in field experiments over the past 8 years are no longer effective in Australia. These include; Stb2/11/WW, Stb3, Stb4, Stb6, Stb7/12, Stb9 and Stb18. Therefore, identifying new sources of APR genes is essential for developing wheat varieties with better agronomic performance. \nAdult plant resistance (APR) genes confer partial but durable resistance to the disease at later stages of plant development. They are preferred in breeding programs because of their flexibility in integrated disease management (IDM) systems and their durability of resistance. These projects aim to discover and transfer novel APR genes for STB resistance into adapted wheat varieties while also determining the optimal combinations of existing effective APR genes and remove the barriers to their adoption by Australian wheat breeding programs. The resources available on this site are developed through research partnerships between GRDC and NSW DPI. There are resources provided on this page which are available to download as well as metadata for resources which have restricted access and will be made available only on request.",

The cruise (#FK150301) began on the 1st of March and ended on the 12th of March, 2015.  Each cast was made to different maximum depths depending on location within and around the canyon.  The exact time (local WST) and location (Lat/Lon in decimal degrees and informal site name) are provided with each data set.  Each cast consists of water column chemistry data taken from laboratory analyses on water samples collected from the rosette bottles.",

    "description": "The Crater Prospect is situated about 4 miles south-south-east of White's workings and 1 mile north-east of the junction of Batchelor Road and the Darwin-Birdum railway line. It is the name assigned to a type area of an extensive radioactive bed of conglomerate. Low grade but wide-spread radioactivity was discovered by R.S. Matheson and D.F. Dyson (geophysicists) in June 1951, while prospecting along the sedimentary beds out-cropping immediately south of the Rum Jungle granite on the south-side of Giant's Reef fault, and on the south side of another major parallel fault. Geiger-Muller traverses along the strike of a grit-conglomerate horizon away from the Crater prospect revealed that the radioactivity extends westwards for 1.5 miles and for half a mile to the east. The radioactivity, which was confined to the conglomerate, was low-grade and discontinuous over this distance of 2 miles. The Crater Prospect, which can be regarded as a type locality, was geologically mapped by the writer on a scale of 200 feet to one inch after the area had been radiometrically contoured, and the plan accompanies this report (Plate 1). [The geology and structure of the prospect, nature of the radioactivity, and prospecting recommendations are discussed].",

    "description": "Magnetic fields are fundamental in regulating star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds. Zeeman splitting offers a unique method to directly measure line-of-sight magnetic field strengths in interstellar environments, from the diffuse ISM to dense cores. Observations of HI and OH absorption toward pulsars provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure magnetic fields with high precision, benefiting from pulsars' small angular sizes and reliable Stokes V spectra unaffected by instrumental effects. Our recent tentative Zeeman splitting detections in OH absorption toward PSR J1644-4559 with Parkes reveal magnetic field strengths that suggest magnetically subcritical states, where magnetic pressure counteracts gravity. This challenges conventional theories of subcritical cold neutral medium (CNM) transitioning to supercritical star-forming molecular clouds, emphasizing the need for detailed investigation. We propose a continuation of Zeeman splitting studies through high-sensitivity OH and HI absorption observations of pulsars PSR J1644-4559, J1721-3532, and J1852+0031 using Parkes. By employing an innovative phase-resolved spectral technique and extending integration times, we aim to enhance Zeeman detection sensitivity and study magnetic field transitions in the CNM and quiescent molecular clouds. This work will refine our understanding of subcritical-to-supercritical transitions in star formation, establish pulsar absorption as a robust probe of interstellar magnetic fields, and advance observational techniques critical to star formation studies.",

The age of the sediment at each sample depth was determined by correlating oxygen isotopes to the Martinson et al. (1987) age model. This information can then be used to infer sedimentation rates. The results indicate that core GC04 is characterised by slow sedimentation rates. The average sedimentation rate is 1.46cm/kyr. The minimum sedimentation rate is ~0.03cm/Kyr, occurring at around MIS 5c and maximum ~4cm/Ka occurring around MIS 5e.",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Bus Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2022",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "title": "Wallaby Creek Flux Data Release 2023_v2",
    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.15) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe forest is classed as a tall, wet sclerophyll forest, and the dominant <em>Eucalyptus Regnans</em> or mountain ash trees have an average canopy height of 75&nbsp;m. The site contains a chronosequence of (20, 80 and 300) stand ages that were established during fires occurring over the last 300 years. The area is assigned the IUCN Category II (National Parks) of the United Nations’ list of National Parks and protected areas, which means the park is primarily managed for ecosystem conservation. The catchment area is dominated by mountain ash, the world’s tallest flowering plant (angiosperm). Trees can reach heights of more than 90&nbsp;m in areas with high rainfall and fertile soil. Mountain ash forests are confined to the cool mountain regions with elevations ranging from 460 to 1100&nbsp;m and average rainfalls of 1100 to 2000&nbsp;mm/y. These trees are well distributed throughout Victoria’s Central Highlands including the Otway Ranges and Strzlecki Ranges; they are also found in Tasmania. The catchment area contains a portion of the Mt. Disappointment range, the Divide and the headwaters of Wallaby Creek and Silver Creek, and much of the slopes are characterised as flat to moderate.\n\nThe station itself is located within an old growth stand with individual trees as old as 300 years. Below the dominant canopy lies a temperate rainforest understorey consisting of <em>Pomaderris aspera</em> and <em>Olearia argophylla</em> species, which are 10 to 18&nbsp;m tall. The lower layers of vegetation are dominated by tree ferns (<em>Cyathea australis</em> and <em>Dicksonia antartica</em>) and extensive tracts of rosette and rhizonic ferns (<em>Polystichum proliferum</em> and <em>Blechnum wattsii</em>) as well as acacia trees. The elevation is approximately 720&nbsp;m. The major soil type within the forest is krasnozemic soils, which are friable red/brown soils, with high amounts of organic matter in the upper 20 to 30&nbsp;cm. However, the composition of krasnozemic soils is not homogenous, but rather varies with altitude. Grey-yellow podsolised soils can be found at lower altitudes, while krasnozemic loams is characteristic of the higher altitudes of the Kinglake and of the Hume Plateau. The clay content of these soils increases with depth until at least 200&nbsp;cm deep, where after a transition soils contain rock fragments. The climate of the study area is classified as a cool, temperate zone, with the highest temperatures occurring during the summer months of December – February (13.8 to 22.5&nbsp;°C), whilst the coolest temperatures are experienced in May and August (4.7 to 9.2&nbsp;°C). Average annual precipitation is 1209&nbsp;mm, with a maximum rainfall occurring in June (Ashton, 2000). The study site experiences foggy conditions after sunset during autumn and winter.\n\nThe original station had a main mast at 110&nbsp;m. This station was destroyed in February 2009 by bushfires. A replacement station was established in March 2010 and started recording in May 2010. The mast sat at a height of 5&nbsp;m. The post-fire instrumentation was not as diverse as the pre-fire instrumentation.",
