    "title": "AIHW - Maternity Indicators - Antenatal Care Visit in First Trimester for All Women Giving Birth (%) (SA3) 2014-2016",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of antenatal care visits in the first trimester for all women giving birth, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and who had their first antenatal care visit (before 14 weeks gestation), divided by the total number of females who gave birth with a stated first antenatal care visit, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. Gestational age at the time of the first antenatal care visit is assessed from the best estimate of gestational age available.\n\n\nAn antenatal care visit is an intentional encounter between a pregnant female and a midwife or doctor prior to labour to assess and improve maternal and fetal wellbeing throughout pregnancy and prior to labour.\n\n\nAll females who gave birth are included for the calculation of this indicator.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nRecords with missing or invalid data for gestational age at first antenatal visit were removed from the denominator. The valid range for gestational age is 3-46 weeks.\n\n\nFrom 2014, Caesarean section at most recent previous birth indicator data item was introduced into the Perinatal NMDS. Although not an NMDS/DSS item prior to 2014, data items appear to match the data element developed by NPDDC, Caesarean section indicator (last previous birth).\n\n\nFor ACT, the first antenatal visit is often the first hospital antenatal clinic visit, scheduled for around 16-18 weeks of pregnancy. In many cases, earlier antenatal care provided by the woman’s general practitioner is not reported.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Manipulative field experiments were used to investigate the effects of the ascidians Botryllus schlosseri and Ascidiella aspersa and the bryozoan Bugula neritina on sessile invertebrate assemblages. Experiments were conducted on perspex plates suspended from Workshops Jetty, Williamstown, Victoria. All 3 introduced species affected the abundance of sessile marine invertebrates, but the effects were varied and not always negative or concentrated on native species. B. neritina increased the abundance of native species, A. aspersa increased the abundance of introduced species and B. schlosseri decreased the abundance of both native and introduced species. This research shows that effects of some introduced species are highly variable and do not conform to typical ideas that exist for introduced species.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of female cancer mortality statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 11 top cancer groupings (breast, cervical, colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, ovary, pancreas, thyroid and uterus) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2009-2013 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality data refer to the number of deaths due to cancer in a given time period. Cancer deaths data are sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2013 National Mortality Database (NMD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - 2013 National Mortality Database.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a PHN. The number of people who could not be assigned a PHN is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the NMD.\n\n\nYear refers to year of occurrence of death for years up to and including 2012, and year of registration of death for 2013. Deaths registered in 2011 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2012 and 2013 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively and are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information, refer to \"Complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia\" in Causes of Death, Australia (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).\n\n",

    "description": "This study examines the effects of  trampling on rocky intertidal platforms dominated by the brown algae Hormosira banksii.   This dataset gives the percent cover of Hormosira  banskii in response to four levels of experimental trampling applied over six summers, between 1991 and 1996, within Point Nepean National Park, Victoria.  Two sites were located at Cheviot Beach (Harry's Pool, Cheviot Mid) and one at Grenade Range (Grenade Range).  The percent cover of Hormosira banskii in each experimental strip of shoreline was assessed  bi-annually for six years. Hormosira banksii was affected by trampling but the response varied with location.  At Cheviot beach periodic disturbance produced a pulse response in the cover of Hormosira, but  responses  to a given level of trampling varied among years.  At  Grenade Range there was little recovery between  trampling periods after two years and by this time Hormosira  was almost eliminated at the highest level of trampling.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2019 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "Magnetic fields are fundamental in regulating star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds. Zeeman splitting offers a unique method to directly measure line-of-sight magnetic field strengths in interstellar environments, from the diffuse ISM to dense cores. Observations of HI and OH absorption toward pulsars provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure magnetic fields with high precision, benefiting from pulsars' small angular sizes and reliable Stokes V spectra unaffected by instrumental effects. Our recent tentative Zeeman splitting detections in OH absorption toward PSR J1644-4559 with Parkes reveal magnetic field strengths that suggest magnetically subcritical states, where magnetic pressure counteracts gravity. This challenges conventional theories of subcritical cold neutral medium (CNM) transitioning to supercritical star-forming molecular clouds, emphasizing the need for detailed investigation. We propose a continuation of Zeeman splitting studies through high-sensitivity OH and HI absorption observations of pulsars PSR J1644-4559, J1721-3532, and J1852+0031 using Parkes. By employing an innovative phase-resolved spectral technique and extending integration times, we aim to enhance Zeeman detection sensitivity and study magnetic field transitions in the CNM and quiescent molecular clouds. This work will refine our understanding of subcritical-to-supercritical transitions in star formation, establish pulsar absorption as a robust probe of interstellar magnetic fields, and advance observational techniques critical to star formation studies.",

Underwater visual census (UVC) monitoring of fish and benthic communities is being carried out at 50 no-take marine reserve (green zone) sites and at 50 sites that have remained open to fishing within the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Long-term monitoring surveys are providing information on:\n\n1. The effects of no-take marine reserves on populations of both species that are fished and other non-fished species. \n\n2. Variations in structure of fish communities due to the reserves and natural disturbances.\n\n3. Structure and dynamics of marine species on the sea bed.\n\n4. Coral health, bleaching, incidence and severity of coral disease and coral predators.\n\n5. Temporal monitoring of the relative number of fishing lines recorded at each site will be used to assess the distribution of fishing effort and provide information on the levels of non-compliance with zoning regulations.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2009, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) for women aged 20 to 69, by age group. The NCSP began in 1991. It aims to reduce cervical cancer cases, illness and deaths in Australia. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation in the NCSP for this report was defined as the percentage of women in the population aged 20-69 who had at least one Pap test in a 2-year period. Participation rates were calculated using the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 20-69 for the relevant 2-year reporting period adjusted for the estimated proportion of women who have had a hysterectomy.\n\n\nAn SA3 was assigned to women using a postcode to SA3 correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nPostcode is used for mailing purposes and may not reflect where a woman resides.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to an SA3 and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nSA3s with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed.\n\n\nSA3 data for Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cotter - Namadgi, Fyshwick - Piallago - Hume, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay, and Lord Howe Island were excluded due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nSome duplication may occur where the same test is reported to the cervical screening register in two or more jurisdictions. This may lead to erroneous results when focusing on smaller geographical areas. This may affect border areas more than others.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.21) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). \n\nThe site is classified as an open woodland savanna. The overstory is co-dominated by tree species <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em> and <em>Eucalyptus tentrodonata</em>, and average tree height is 14-16&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is close to 64&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 1750&nbsp;mm. Maximum temperatures range from 30.4&nbsp;°C (in July) to 33.2&nbsp;°C (in November), while minimum temperatures range from 19.3&nbsp;°C (in July) to 25.4&nbsp;°C (in November). Therefore, the maximum and minimum range varies from 7&nbsp;°C (wet season) to 11&nbsp;°C (dry season).\n\nThe instrument mast is 23&nbsp;m tall. Heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide measurements are taken using the open-path eddy flux technique. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation are measured above the canopy. Soil heat fluxes are measured and soil moisture content is gathered using time domain reflectometry.",

    "description": "In the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, males attract females to their burrows by waving their enlarged yellow claw. Colour is clearly involved in species recognition in U. mjoebergi, but the role of the species-specific colour pattern has not been investigated. \n\nHere we show that U. mjoebergi females preferentially approach uniformaly yellow claws over bicoloured, yellow and white, claws. This is not due to a preference for a larger yellow signal, as they fail to discriminate between bicoloured claws differing in the proportion of yellow. Claw colour and pattern appear to be equally important in the recognition of conspecific males, as females do not distinguish between a uniformly coloured claw of the wrong colour and a claw containing yellow in the wrong pattern.\n\nExperiments were conducted in October 2005, near the mangrove boardwalk in the East Point Reserve, Darwin, NT.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2019 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

It includes venue classification and the allocation of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) throughout Victoria.\nFor more information visit the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation's (VCGLR) website.\nChanges in trading name:\n\n\nMILDURA GRAND HOTEL changed name to GRAND ON DEAKIN in February 2017\n\n\nZEGAME'S CARDINIA HOTEL changed trading name to CASTELLO'S CARDINIA HOTEL in Aug 2016.\n\n\nVICTORIAN HARNESS RACING SPORTS CLUB changed trading name to MVRC JUNCTION CLUB in May 2017\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data through joining it with gaming venue locations from the VCGLR's interactive map of Victoria's gaming venues extracted on the 8th of March 2019. Therefore venues that have either changed their trading name or cease to exist as of the 8th of March 2019 will not be included in this dataset, despite being active in the year expenditure was recorded. \n\n\nEGM Numbers: Average number of operating EGM's at the gaming venue during the month. This figure is consistent with the average entitlement applied to the EGM as per tax calculation.\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in February 2011, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "title": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) Mapping for the East Gippsland CMA",
    "description": "Potential Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) are ecosystems identified within the landscape as likely to be at least partly dependent on groundwater. State-wide screening analysis was performed to identify locations of potential terrestrial GDEs, including wetland areas. The GDE mapping was developed utilising satellite remote sensing data, geological data and groundwater monitoring data in a GIS overlay model. Validation of the model through field assessment has not been performed. The method has been applied for all of Victoria and is the first step in identifying potential groundwater dependent ecosystems that may be threatened by activities such as drainage and groundwater pumping. The dataset specifically covers the East Gippsland Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area. The method used in this research is based upon the characteristics of a potential GDE containing area as one that:\n1. Has access to groundwater. By definition a GDE must have access to groundwater. For GDE occurrences associated with wetlands and river systems the water table will be at surface with a zone of capillary extension. In the case of terrestrial GDE's (outside of wetlands and river systems), these are dependent on the interaction between depth to water table and the rooting depth of the vegetation community.\n2. Has summer (dry period) use of water. Due to the physics of root water uptake, GDEs will use groundwater when other sources are no longer available; this is generally in summer for the Victorian climate. The ability to use groundwater during dry periods creates a contrasting growth pattern with surrounding landscapes where growth has ceased.\n3. Has consistent growth patterns, vegetation that uses water all year round will have perennial growth patterns.\n4. Has growth patterns similar to verified GDEs. \nThe current mapping does not indicate the degree of groundwater dependence, only locations in the landscape of potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. This dataset does not directly support interpretation of the amount of dependence or the amount of groundwater used by the regions highlighted within the maps. Further analysis and more detailed field based data collection are required to support this.\n\nThe core data used in the modelling is largely circa 1995 to 2005. It is expected that the methodology used will over estimate the extent of terrestrial GDEs. There will be locations that appear from EvapoTranspiration (ET) data to fulfil the definition of a GDE (as defined by the mapping model) that may not be using groundwater. Two prominent examples are: 1. Riparian zones along sections of rivers and creeks that have deep water tables where the stream feeds the groundwater system and the riparian vegetation is able to access this water flow, as well as any bank storage contained in the valley alluvials. 2. Forested regions that are accessing large unsaturated regolith water stores.\nThe terrestrial GDE layer polygons are classified based on the expected depth to groundwater (ie shallow &lt;5 m or deep &gt;5 m). Additional landscape attributes are also assigned to each mappnig polygon.\n\nIn 2011-2012 a species tolerance model was developed by Arthur Rylah Institute, collaborating with DPI, to model landscapes with ability to support GDEs and to provide a relative measure of sensitivity of those ecosystems to changes in groundwater availability and quality. Rev 1 of the GDE mapping incorporates species tolerance model attributes for each potential GDE polygon and attributes for interpreted depth to groundwater.\n\nSeparate datasets and associated metadata records have been created for GDE species tolerance.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset contains multibeam sonar bathymetry data from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11).\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe Beetaloo GBA region in the Northern Territory of Australia currently supports a modest gas extraction industry. With the possibility of a significantly expanded industry in the future, it is important to understand the current environmental impacts of the industry. Towards this end, this analysis examines the effects of current gas extraction activities on vegetation cover condition in the Beetaloo GBA region. It does this using the Compere relative benchmarking framework, which has been parameterised here to use ground cover fraction data (which is an excellent proxy for landscape condition) and to separate-out the variability in ground cover associated with natural processes from the variability associated with human activities. Results show that gas extraction wells and gas pipelines had significant negative effects on cover condition at their immediate locations compared to vegetation in the surrounding 1 km of land. Beyond distances of 1 km, pipelines seemed to have no further effect on condition whereas at distances between 1 and 4 km from wells, condition was found to be significantly lower than at the well location itself. The reasons for this are not known. Given that only minimal extraction activities currently occur across the Beetaloo GBA region, this study provides a baseline assessment against which future analyses could be compared if the industry is further developed.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nCSIRO\n\n\n## **History** \nSix input datasets were used to define biophysical equivalence (locations of similar growing conditions): precipitation, burned area; elevation, available water holding capacity, and long-term average tree foliage cover fraction.  Precipitation data were from the monthly data of Jones et al. (2009).  Burned area data (MCD64A1, Collection 6) were from Giglio et al. (2009); elevation from Gallant et al. (2011); water holding capacity from Viscarra Rossel et al. 2014 and tree fractional cover were based on the methods of Donohue et al. (2009).  Cover condition was assessed using total cover fraction data of Guerschman et al. (2015), which is based on MCD43A4 C6 imagery.  Surface Water Points data were used to test results and were sourced from Crossman and Li (2015).\r\n\r\nCrossman S, Li O (2015). Surface Hydrology points (Regional). Geosciences Australia.

The voyage took place from 11-22 November 2021 departing from Hobart (TAS) and returning to Hobart (TAS).\nThe Kongsberg EM710 MKII multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry,  backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter through the shelf-break region and seamount clusters within Huon AMP.\nThe EM710 MKII provides a 0.5° by 1° transmit and receive angular resolution respectively. The echosounder's nominal frequency range is from 40 to 100 kHz.\nData are stored in .all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and .wcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. There are: \n\n196 raw *.all files totalling 4.32GB in this dataset.\n25 raw *.wcd files totalling 49.6GB in this dataset \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nTide corrections were not applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format, and processed bathymetry and backscatter grids in geotiff format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report. Additional data products may be available on request.",

The Buildings dataset has relationships with the G-NAF, Cadastre, Property and Administrative Boundaries products produced by Geoscape Australia. Users should note that these related Geoscape products are not part of Buildings.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Buildings, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the coverage area accessed by you can not be greater than a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nBuildings is a digital dataset representing buildings across Australia. Data quality and potential capture timelines will vary across Australia based on two categories, each category has been developed based on a number of factors including the probability of the occurrence of natural events (e.g. flooding), population distribution and industrial/commercial activities. Areas with a population greater than 200, or with significant industrial/commercial activity in a visual assessment have been defined as 'Urban' and all other regions have been defined as 'Rural'. This dataset has been restricted to the Perth City SA2 by AURIN.",

    "description": "Detailed models, embedded within the MECO circulation model, of the primary production and nutrient cycling on the NWS. And a detailed model of the NWS food-web was developed using the Ecopath-Ecosim-Ecospace models and software (Bulman et al 2006), Also an agent-based model of the food-web was developed for the NWS, but was found to be slow and inefficient at large space scales and to give very similar outputs to the faster model of Bulman et al.(2006). From examination of all these models it was found that there was very little interaction between the human uses examined by the MSE and primary productivity, nutrient cycling or the food-web. Instead the major affects of the human uses were through the more direct consequences of harvesting, habitat modification and water quality. With respect to fisheries this is consistent with the findings of Sainsbury (1988). So while these other factors were maintained in the MSE model, primary production, nutrient cycling and trophic interactions were not explicitly included. At higher exploitation rates and contamination levels, or a different set of human uses, than is currently envisaged on the NWS it is likely that the impacts on primary production, nutrient cycling and trophic interactions would become important.",

    "description": "A manipulative field experiment was used to assess the spatial variation in the effect of copper on sessile invertebrates within a marina in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. Sessile invertebrate assemblages were grown on perspex plates for 6 weeks and then dosed with plaster blocks impregnated with copper sulfate. After 1 week of exposure to the copper the plates were collected and the numbers of sponges, polychaetes, barnacles, bryozoans and ascidians were counted on each plate. The variation in abundances of individual taxa were estimated at spatial scales of metres. Water flow was measured as a possible explanation for the variation in the effects of copper. \n\nThree of the 20 sessile invertebrates species showed significant small scale variation in the effect of copper. The effects of copper on these species varied in magnitude and direction. Water flow did not explain the variation in the effects of copper. It is suggested that variations in organic or inorganic compounds or in pH levels may provide alternative explanations for the spatially variable effects of copper in the marina.",

For the annual census, a part-time student is enrolled in less than 10 units, regardless of where those units are studied. All Kindergarten to Year 10 students are considered to be full-time.\n\n\nStudent enrolments are generally reported in full-time equivalent units (FTE). The FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.\n\n\nIn most scholastic years there are a small number of students in atypical age groups. For students under 18 years, these have been included in the nearest band. This is indicated with an asterisk. As a result, the sum of each row may not equal the totals reported.

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) indicators by activity node locations for the year of 2011.\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity)\n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility.\nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Route Segment (Polyline) 2011\".\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website. A full list of SNAMUTS publications can be found at http://www.snamuts.com/publications.html.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of general practitioner (GP) and specialist attendances by age group and sex. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nGP after-hours attendances are Medicare benefit-funded after-hours patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. They include urgent and non-urgent attendances.\n\n\nSpecialist attendances are Medicare benefits-funded referred patient/doctor encounters, such as visits, consultations, and attendances by video conference, involving medical practitioners who have been recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for Medicare benefits purposes.\n\n",

    "description": "To date the Mosquito Creek field appears primarily to be a good gouger's prospect. It could carry one Company operating a small plant but not as at present three or four Companies. However, the whole of the exposed granite rock has not been prospected, and the possibilities of the field not realised. It is possible that lodes of payable width, i.e. 3 ft or more, may be located in the future. The veins proved to date are thin but are numerous, persist over long distances and carry value at depth. Valuation of scheelite ground is by no means as simple as has been reported in the press. Wind and rain have concentrated the ore in the surface soil covering these numerous veins, over widths up to 20 feet. These areas of quartz-scheelite are easily located by the use of an ultra-violet lamp and could be stripped by bulldozers. The obvious action for any company interested in this field would be [as follows]. 1. To satisfy themselves by trial of the commercial value of the strippings. 2. To carry out active exploration and cover by mining lease large areas of scheelite veined granite. 3. To consider the thickest reefs so exposed at a later date. The existing companies have not been alive to the possibilities of the field, have purchased at high cost small leases and exuded a great deal of hot air. The further possibilities of the field are reasonably good and depend primarily on the recovery of scheelite by bull-dozing to shallow depth veined granite.",

    "description": "Some experimental geophysical work was undertaken by the Bureau of Mineral Resources at the Moura Coalfield in Queensland in order to investigate the structure of coal seams which lie within 1000 feet of the surface. The aim of the survey was to evaluate the use of geophysical techniques for locating faults of small displacement. Most of the effort was concentrated on shallow seismic reflection techniques but additional techniques (magnetic, gravity, resistivity, electromagnetic and induced polarization) were used. \n\nThe whole area of the survey was covered with a close-spaced grid of gravity and magnetic stations. A lesser effort was devoted to resistivity, electromagnetic, and induced polarization methods, the object being to take advantage of the opportunity to tryout these relatively inexpensive methods in the hope that they might give some indications of fault locations. These methods will be evaluated in a separate Record; this one deals- with the results of the seismic work. Encouraging results were obtained from seismic reflection work. The uppermost economic coal seam was mapped to within 300 feet of the surface and areas of faulting could be deduced from time differences and lack of continuity in reflections.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains the shapefiles and grids of the total upstream catchment areas for the 30 surface water receptor sites in the Gloucester subregion. Catchment areas were calculated using the BA SYD Albers projection.\n\n\n\nGDA_1994_BA_SYD_Albers\n\nAuthority: Custom\n\n\n\nProjection: Albers\n\nFalse_Easting: 0.0\n\nFalse_Northing: 0.0\n\nCentral_Meridian: 151.0\n\nStandard_Parallel_1: -18.0\n\nStandard_Parallel_2: -36.0\n\nLatitude_Of_Origin: 0.0\n\nLinear Unit: Meter (1.0)\n\n\n\nGeographic Coordinate System: GCS_GDA_1994\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nTotal upstream catchement areas were generated using the ArcGIs 10.1 Spatial Analyst Watershed function on each receptor location. The input pour points and flow direction raster are those indicated in the lineage. To generate total catchments rather than nested catchments the watershed function was run separately on each point feature in the receptor shapefile. This process was automated in a Python script which is also included (though note that paths specified in the script are legacy paths from when the script was run and accessed and output data in a local workspace environment).\n\n\n\nThe script also converts the output watershed rasters to individual receptor catchment shapfiles. However, there is also a merged feature dataset in the file geodatabase.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) GLO SW receptor total catchment areas V01.

    "description": "The ISC2010_BARE_GROUND_S table is the Statistical Summary table for the Bare Ground Metric at the 100m Section level.\n\nThe ISC2010_BARE_GROUND_S table is designed to JOIN to the ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINES_S feature class.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem (SA3 code 70203) and East Arnhem (SA3 code 70204) are combined in the original data.

The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP29 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\nData are stored in .raw (366 files 8.12 GB) raw and .seg (358 files 8.01 GB) segy formats at CSIRO.\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "The Australian National Facility for Ocean Gliders (ANFOG), with IMOS/NCRIS funding, deploys a fleet of eight gliders around Australia.\n\nThe underwater ocean glider represents a technological revolution for oceanography. Autonomous ocean gliders can be built relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusables allowing them to make repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal ecosystems.\n\nThe ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders. \nSlocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator), manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m) were high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have three Slocum gliders for deployment on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. ANFOG uses their five Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical, chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders, due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position and depth\n\nSustained ocean observations will allow researchers to document the natural variability of the ocean, and better understand the effect of climate change on coastal ecosystems. The IMOS gliders will focus particularly on the major boundary currents that run down the Australia coast, the Leeuwin in the west and the East Australian Current (EAC). The study of these currents is critical for understanding the north-south transport of freshwater, heat and biogeochemical properties. The currents exert a large influence on coastal ecosystems, shipping lanes and fisheries.\n\nFollowing a public call for proposals in 2007 for the IMOS infrastructure, the ocean gliders have been allocated to four projects which will be coordinated by research teams at four of the IMOS Science Nodes:\n-NSW-IMOS (Exploring hydrodgraphy and fluorescence in the East Australian Current, its eddy field and in the Tasman front) \n-Bluewater (Monitoring the Southward extension of the East Australian Current)\n-SAIMOS (Boundary and shelf currents exchange with the shelves of South Australia and Victoria)\n-WAIMOS (Understand the role of the Leeuwin current system in controlling not only the marine life but also the climate of south western Australia)",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThis database supersedes initial PED AssetList database V1 20150313 (GUID 84251560-5af2-490e-a4d8-6208ef91ae62) by adding the missed point SA state economic data. This dataset contains the spatial and non-spatial (attribute) components of the Pedirka subregion Asset List as one .mdb file, which is readable as an MS Access database and an ESRI personal geodatabase. \n\n\n\nUnder the BA programme, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Pedirka are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Pedirka subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. \n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA programme. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"PED_asset_database_doc_20150319.doc \", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"PED_asset_database_doc_20150319.doc\" located in the zip file. \n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis is a complete list of assets in this subregion to be assessed by the bioregional assessment programme as of 19th March, 2015.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate\t             Notes\n\n1.0\t              13/03/2015\tInitial database\n\n1.1\t              19/03/2015\tAdd SA point Eco data (2 assets and 28 Elements) and fixed Note field values and some AIDs in table AssetDecisions\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) Asset database for the Pedirka subregion on 19 March 2015.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to deaths due to all causes (combined) by sex. The reported statistics include year of death, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates, rate ratio, median age at death, premature deaths, potential years of life lost and potentially avoidable deaths. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC09) was collected from a depth of 166m within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~60cm depth, corresponding to isotopically heavier 18O. Other parameters were also analysed to assist in reaching this conclusion. This would give a relatively low sedimentation rate of 3cm / kyr, compared to 50cm / kyr for similar depths in the west Queensland trough.",

    "description": "Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) - Vegetation Complexes - SCP250k\n\nThe dataset shows pre-1750 distribution of vegetation complexes characteristic of various combinations of landforms, soils and rainfall along the Swan Coastal Plain south of Lancelin. For the majority of this area, the vegetation complexes are those defined by Heddle et al. (1980) at the scale of 1:250,000 and include some minor attribution corrections undertaken in 2015.\n\nThe Heddle mapping was restricted to the System 6 area and thus the vegetation complex mapping did not extend to the far southern section of Swan Coastal Plain. This southern section was subsequently captured by Webb et al. (2016) at a scale of 1:250,000. The 2016 mapping also consolidated the vegetation complex boundaries along the Whicher and Darling scarp interface using complexes defined by Mattiske &amp; Havel (1990), soil landscape phases (DAFWA 2007) and information in Hagan et al. (2011).\n\nSee additional metadata for information on the location of summary descriptions of each complex and references. ",

This historical dataset is out of date and no longer updated.  The data is spatially available as a layer on the Protected Matters Search Tool on the DCCEEW website. \nIt is a polygon coverage representing the wetlands cited in the \"A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia\" Third Edition (EA, 2001), plus various additions for wetlands listed after 2001.\nThis coverage is a compilation of various data sources and has been collected using a variety of methods. This dataset was used as an indicative guide only to wetland boundaries and locations. The data has been collated by the Australian Government from various datasets including those supplied by the relevant State agencies.\nState agency contributors include the Queensland Environmental Protection Authority, NSW Department of Environment and Conservation and the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment.\nFor the identification of wetland boundaries or locations in regard to the compliance of activities with relevant State legislation, the relevant State authority should be contacted to obtain the most recent and accurate wetland boundary information available.\nThe criteria for the definition of a wetland used in this dataset is that adopted by the Ramsar Convention, namely: \"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters.\"",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth aged younger than 20 years who smoked at any time during pregnancy, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC) and historical data for time trends. Where the term 'teenage mother' is used the analysis is based on women who gave birth aged under 20. Teenage mothers and their babies are more likely to experience broader disadvantage, have antenatal risk factors and have poorer maternal and baby outcomes during and after birth, than older mothers and their babies. \nThe Teenage Mothers in Australia data accompanies the Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nExcludes women for whom smoking status at any time during pregnancy was 'Not stated' and women not usually resident in Australia or whose usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the rangeland grazing system model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This report examines three potential outlook scenarios for Australia's forestry sector using analysis of the potential availability and use of logs, forecasts of wood product consumption, and the opportunities for processing of wood products and investment. \r\n\r\n ABARES conducted a number of workshops with industry and government stakeholders to refine the scenarios and test the assumptions supporting this analysis. A business-as-usual scenario was analysed, which depicts a future assuming current economic, policy and environmental factors affecting the forestry sector remain unchanged over the projection period (to 2050). Two alternative scenarios (priority-to-productivity and constrained-wood-production) are also examined. Sensitivity testing was also conducted to identify the influence of key parameters. \r\n\r\n The analysis in this report highlights some key opportunities for Australia's forestry sector, as well as the economic and policy factors required for realising these opportunities. The results affirm that a positive investment environment for upgrading and expanding wood processing infrastructure will underpin growth in Australia's forestry sector. ",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Perth) with SA2 code (51041).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Perth City SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

These zones have been subject to cleanup in line with the relevant environmental standards. However, restrictions remain on what the water can be used for if it is extracted via a groundwater bore.\nGQRUZ do not represent a comprehensive list of all sites where groundwater quality may not be suitable for use.  Rather, they represent locations where EPA has formally recognised that groundwater is polluted, following site investigations under EPA's environmental audit program.  Other sources of information on groundwater quality include EPA's Priority Sites Register, which lists sites which are currently undergoing clean-up under EPA's compliance and enforcement activities.\nThis dataset is in spatial format and contains a map of GQRUZ across Victoria.",

    "description": "This dataset contains groundwater salinity information for boreholes which were less than 20m in depth and had terminated at least 30m above bedrock. The bores have been extracted predominantly from the Groundwater Management System (GMS) and the State Observation Bore Network (SOBN). \nIt should be noted that the analysis undertaken with the salinity data was only of a preliminary nature and should be treated with a critical approach. Local validation of the data (e.g. screen depths) needs to be undertaken in detail.\n\nThe dataset was compiled by GHD to inform the report 'Potential Influences of Geological Structures on Groundwater Flow Systems' for DEPI's Secure Allocation Future Entitlements (SAFE) Project.",

    "description": "One of the few remaining pristine coastal environments in the world, the Kimberley is highly valued for its biodiversity, cultural values, tourism and fisheries. The biodiversity of the Kimberley coast is fuelled by oceanic and terrestrially derived nutrient resources, yet there has been limited prior research about how nutrients vary or how they are used and recycled across the region. Building this understanding is essential to inform future management of the Kimberley coast and marine parks.\nThis project has therefore been undertaken to address both of the major research priorities emphasised in the Kimberley Marine Research Program Science Plan: (a) providing the bio-physical characterisation required for marine resource management and (b) improving understanding of ecosystem function and how this might change in response to future trends in human use. In particular, this project has aimed to elucidate the processes controlling carbon and nutrient flows through pelagic ecosystems in the Kimberley region. Specifically, we have sought to link physical processes and riverine inputs to food web structure and function, improving process understanding of pathways and material flows that connect habitats, populations and bioregions in the Kimberley. We have identified sources of nutrients and how they translate to productivity for consumers, and through this work have supported the development of an improved understanding of how such processes may be modified by a changing climate.\n\nData is stored on Pawsey Data Portal (https://data.pawsey.org.au/public/?path=/WA Node Ocean Data Network/WAMSI2/KMRP/2.2/2.2.2) available after embargo.",

    "description": "    \n\nThe historical data in this table are sourced from Becker C and M Sinclair\n(2004), :Profitability of Reserve Bank Foreign Exchange Operations:\nTwenty Years After the Float-C/, RB Research Discussion Paper No\n2004-06. Updates to the data are published annually with a one-year lag.\n\nIt is not appropriate to use the :Market-C/ series as a proxy for\nforeign exchange market intervention. The RB engages in spot or forward\ntransactions with dealers in the market virtually every day. Most of these\ntransactions are not intended to influence the exchange rate. Rather, they\noccur to cover orders for foreign exchange from clients such as the Australian\nGovernment. When the RB sells foreign exchange to a client, it has the choice\nof meeting this out of its holdings of foreign exchange or buying the\nequivalent amount of foreign exchange in the market. Most of the time it does\nthe latter, though even then the timing of the sale and purchase may not\ncoincide precisely. The RB can also engage in foreign exchange transactions\nwith counterparties other than dealers as a means of covering client orders.\n\nDaily net foreign exchange transactions, net sales (-) and purchases (+), are\nreported according to the date on which the trade took place. This is in\ncontrast to the monthly transactions data in Table A.4, which are reported\naccording to the day on which settlement took place. Another difference to\nTable A.4 is that interest received on holdings of foreign assets is not\nincluded.\n\naMarketa transactions are foreign exchange transactions against the Australian\ndollar (excluding foreign exchange swaps) undertaken by the RB with\nauthorised foreign exchange dealers in Australia or banks overseas.\n\naGovernment and other counterpartiesa transactions include the RBAas foreign\nexchange transactions with the Australian Government, outright transactions\nwith other central banks and international financial institutions that are not\nintended to affect the exchange rate, and transactions with clients other than\nthe Australian Government.\n\n",
