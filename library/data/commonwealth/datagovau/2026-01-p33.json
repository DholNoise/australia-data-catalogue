Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

The mooring is located at Latitude:-33.9, Longitude:121.8. The mooring was retrieved in December 2013, and not redeployed. \n\nPhysical sampling will be undertaken at each of the reference stations on a monthly basis (The last sample at this site was collected in July 2013). The physical samples will be analysed for nutrients, plankton species, both visibly and genetically, and pCO2. Biological sampling will greatly improve Australia's capability to meet its obligations for ecosystem based management and allow many researchers the opportunity to investigate possible long term changes in ecology that are likely to be linked to climate variability and wide scale validation of remotely sensed (satellite) observations of plant biomass.",

The datasets derived from the monitoring are published and warning signs are put in place where required.\n\nInformation on water quality monitoring can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/environment-and-water/water-and-air-quality/water-quality-monitoring\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.\n\nThis dataset consists of the level of microbial contamination within Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. Brisbane City Council monitors of enterococci bi-monthly in summer and monthly during the cooler winter months. The presence of high levels of enterococci can vary daily, and may be elevated after heavy rainfall. Enterococci exposure can contribute to increased health risk and primary contact should be avoided.\n\nThe Data and resources section of this dataset contains further information for this dataset.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\n\n\nA SHORT GUIDE TO NSW OFFICE OF WATER'S LICENSING DATA\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1.\tUsing the supplied bioregional assessment data capture polygons a spatial select was taken for each polygon area for the Surface and Groundwater Approved Work locations. These Work Location points were exported to an ArcGIS 10.0 File Geodatabase for each polygon area. These work locations have a \"Status\" of either \"Active\" (under the Water Act) or \"Current\" (under the Water Management Act). This is saved BA_all\\Hydrogeology\\Allocations\\_NoW_GW_entitlements_Oct13\n\n2. These spatial locations link to the licence volumes found in the \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls and the \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls as per below \n\n3.     The work locations in these shapefiles link to the  Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n4.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n5.\tThe Approved License number attached to each Work was then used to query the Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\n6.\tIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n7.\tIt should be noted that due to query size constraints in WLS the output files for each polygon area may be split into a number of subset files (\"n\" being the number of the subset).\n\n8.\tThe field headings are as per the WLS Extract report. They include some characters (e.g. \"\\\") that may cause problems if loaded into ArcGIS. Not knowing how the data is to be used I have not amended them.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Licensing data\n\n1.\tA Licensed Work Approval may have more than work (and therefore work location, i.e. point) associated with it. If the Licensed Work Approval is under the old Water Act it may have associated with it an \"Entitlement\" volume (if on a Regulated River) or an \"Allocation\" volume in an unregulated area. Please note that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n2.\tA Licensed Work Approval, if under the newer Water Management Act may have more than one linked WAL. Each WAL may have a \"Share Component\" volume associated with it. This will nee to be summed against each linked Licensed Work Approval to get the total WAL volume. Please note again that these volumes are for the whole licensed approval distributed amongst the related works but not against any particular one.\n\n3.\tIt is important to note that under the WMA it is possible for WALs not to have a linked Licensed Work Approval (to support Water Trading). This means a spatial select with not find these WALs and the volumes associated with them. The WAL is still related to a particular Water Source and can be re-associated with a different Licensed Work Approval at a later date.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. Third parties may request a copy of the data from DPI Water (previously known as the NSW Office of Water) at http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis data was extracted from  Office of Water's Water Licensing System (WLS) to extract details on each Approved license including any linked Water Access Licenses (WAL) if the Work was now under the Water Management Act (WMA). These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n.xls.\n\nIf found the linked WAL number is used to re-query using WLS to extract details on each linked WAL. These files end in \\*_WLS-EXTRACT_n_WALs_volume.xls.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nNSW Office of Water (2013) CLM16gwl NSW Office of Water Groundwater Licence Extract Clarence Moreton-  Oct 2013.

    "title": "Parent record: Flow patterns within Jervis Bay: Winter deployment of current meters",
    "description": "This record describes components of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). The initial aims of the project were to obtain current and wind observations from Jervis bay over a six week period in order to detail the wind driven circulation and provide a data set for comparison with the numerical modelling work being simultaneously undertaken. However, after this initial experiment it became clear that there were significant currents in the bay that are not simply related to direct wind forcing. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for driving the flow had to be investigated, through the measurement programs and data analysis, as well as through numerical modelling. The result was a series of approximately six separate experiments aiming to define the water circulation around the bay and through the bay entrance, to gain an understanding of the processes that drive the currents, and to investigate the influence of stratification on the nature of the currents.\n\nThe second of these six experiments concentrated on the flow patterns within the bay during the winter months, when the waters are only weakly thermally stratified. This winter mooring program was run as two deployments of current meters, from 10th July to 30th August and from 12th September to 30th October 1990, along with a meteorological station measuring winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head. [Given that this meteorological data bridges all six experiments, the data collected is described in a separate metadata record and will not be considered further.] \n\nTwo moorings were maintained with each deployment. In the first deployment (10/7/90 - 30/8/90) the south-central mooring contained 3 current meters and the northeast mooring 2 current meters. The second deployment (12/9/90 - 30/10/90) repeated the south-central mooring but the northeast mooring was moved south from near Green Point to off Honeymoon Bay.\n\nAs this is a parent record, no data is available to download. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to this project is available through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results. There are four subsidiary records that directly relate to this parent, through which the data is provided (see hierarchical tree): \n6fed5f70-c336-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\na1da6830-c344-11dc-9e24-00188b4c0af8\n45ede7c0-c3d2-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8\n0b9e1780-c3d6-11dc-8135-00188b4c0af8",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile.

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2016.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The processes undertaken to compile this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThe dataset provides the model extent and predicted drawdown for the Namoi Catchment Water Study (SWS, 2012) and Gunnedah Basin Regional Model (CDM Smith, 2014).\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe purpose of this dataset is to enable a comparison between the model extents and drawdowns predicted by the model developed for BA and previous regional scale models in the Namoi.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe drawdown maps were digitised from figures in the reports by SWS (2012) and CDM Smith (2014).\n\n\n\nThe model extents were derived from the MODFLOW grids aggregating the cells that are active in any layer and then turning them into a shapefile.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) Previous regional groundwater model domains within the Namoi subregion. Bioregional Assessment Source Dataset. Viewed 11 December 2018, http://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/dataset/f740efec-9f93-478f-80c8-3b67629860db.",

    "description": "The Air-Sea Flux Stations (ASFS) sub-facility is responsible for open-ocean moorings that measure real-time meteorological and oceanographic conditions at the sea surface.  In particular, the stations provide data on air-sea heat and moisture fluxes, which, when combined with meteorological data, are essential for climate change research.  The continuous time series provided by the air-sea flux stations are particularly important because many of the processes that control heat and moisture fluxes exchange show variability on a wide range of time scales. ASFS aims to deliver high quality air-sea flux measurements on a near real-time basis. \n\nObservations are obtained by the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) mooring in the Sub-Antarctic zone, south-west of Tasmania (46.75S 141E). The SOFS mooring has dual sets of radiometers, temperature and humidity sensors, precipitation gauges and sonic anemometers. \n\nData are broadcast via satellite back to Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. Daily files of 1-hourly averages of the observations and calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0200UTC and made available via the IMOS Ocean Portal.",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \n\nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

It combines a range of indicators into a single condition score, including riparian vegetation, geomorphic condition, hydrologic stress, biodiversity, catchment disturbance, and water quality.\n\nThe RCI was developed in 2012 using the Framework for the Assessment of River and Wetland Health (FARWH) approach. The FARWH is an accepted method applied throughout Australia that uses existing data collection activities across jurisdictions and converts them into a standardised and nationally comparable representation of river health.\n\nThe River Condition Index: method document <em>(aka River Condition Index Manual_Method Report.pdf)</em> provides a detailed explanation of the index and how it has been applied across NSW. This reflects the latest version of the RCI product.\n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

    "description": "<strong>Introduction</strong> \n\nThe Dora Creek Flood Risk Management Plan has been prepared for Lake Macquarie City Council (Council) in accordance with the NSW Floodplain Development Manual (April 2005 - Reference 1) and the August 2010 Flood Risk Management Guide – Incorporating sea level rise benchmarks in flood risk assessment (Reference 4) and:\n<ul>\n<li>Is based on a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of factors that affect and are\naffected by the use of flood prone land; </li>\n<li>Represents the considered opinion of the local community on how to best manage its flood risk and its flood prone land; and </li>\n<li>Provides a long-term path for the future development of the community.  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Dora Creek catchment is located on the western side of Lake Macquarie waterway, 30 km south-west of Newcastle and 120 km north of Sydney. Dora Creek has a catchment area of approximately 238 km2 and is the largest catchment flowing into the Lake Macquarie waterway which has a total catchment of 648 km2 (Figure 1).\nThe study area focuses on the existing township of Dora Creek and includes the townships of Cooranbong and Avondale, where new and planned rural and urban developments are proposed within the floodplain. The upper limit of the study area extends above Freemans Drive to Cooranbong and downstream to the confluence of Dora Creek with the Lake Macquarie waterway. \nThere are three main tributaries within the catchment with Dora Creek being joined by Jigadee Creek at Cooranbong and then Stockton Creek before draining into Lake Macquarie waterway at Bonnells Bay and Lake Eraring. \nWatercourses within the catchment area and above the tidal limit are narrow; Dora Creek is typically less than 15 m wide upstream of Freemans Drive. Below the tidal limit, the creeks become broader with Dora Creek varying from a width of 50m at the Sydney to Newcastle Freeway to 100m where it forms a delta into Lake Macquarie waterway. Upstream of the delta the Eraring Power station draws cooling water for steam condensation from Bonnells Bay, which passes under Dora Creek through a concrete tunnel and open canal.",

Metadata was not provided and has been compiled by the Bioregional Assessment Programme based on known details at the time of acquisition. The dataset was acquired 3/11/16.\n\n\n\nThis dataset consists of a set of spreadsheets and text files containing raw water level data for bores across the whole of Queensland. A shapefile is also provided based on the registration spreadsheet.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis dataset represents an update of the groundwater data that was used to construct the potentiometric surface mapping presented in Evans et al. (2016). The reason for the update was that it became apparent that a lot of new data had been added to the groundwater database since July 2014.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nBorehole data, including water level information, provided to the Bioregional Assessment project by the custodian - QLD DNRM. No History has been provided.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2016) Queensland groundwater data October 2016. Bioregional Assessment Source Dataset.

The hardwood data includes a range of eucalypt species however the vast majority of the plantation estate (&gt;90%) is E.globulus or bluegums. LGA’s with &lt;100ha of plantation, which were predominantly in the drier wheat belt have been removed from the dataset which were primarily other Eucalypt species. \nSome LGA’s will only show plantation area with the key species marked as OTHER. These are plantations of several eucalypt species including E.astringens, E.polybractea, E.loxophleba, E.cladocalyx and S.spicatum. Harvest residue figures are not known for these plantations yet.",

Most other collections use enrolment data that are collected as part of the Mid Year Census in August.                 \n\n\nThe number of LBOTE students enrolled in SSPs are not broken down for each SA4 grouping. These students are, however, included in the Totals for each SA4 Group.\n\n\nPrimary students in mainstream support classes are included in Year 3 to 6.\n\n\nSecondary students in mainstream support classes are included in Year 7 to 10. \n\n\nHistorical publications of the Statistical Bulletin compared enrolments in DoE regions. Since 2014 these geographies have been discontinued and replaced with a geographical structure based on the new ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Groups of ASGS Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries in New South Wales have been combined into 11 groups for reporting and publication of department data.\n\n\nFor more detailed analysis of students of language background other than English, please refer to Schools: Language diversity in NSW. \n\n\nAs of 2022, Norfolk Island (previously included in NSW total) is no longer under the jurisdiction of NSW, and therefore not included in the figures.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

The data spans every two years between 2010-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic boundaries from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the number of deaths from birth to less than 5 years, and the denominator as the total number of live births.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nDeaths are attributed to the area in which the infant or child usually resided, irrespective of where they died.\n\n\nBirths are attributed to the area of usual residence of the mother, not location of birth.\n\n\nDeaths are reported by year of registration of death.\n\n\nData for 2010 have been adjusted for the additional deaths arising from outstanding registrations of deaths in Queensland in 2010.\n\n\nMortality rates for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the total number of live births for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

It involves quarterly counts at all known daytime roost sites of grey-headed and spectacled flying-foxes across both species' national ranges, and at black and little-red flying-fox camps where those camps occur within the range of the previous two species or outside these ranges, where monitoring is possible. The aim of the program is to establish a reliable benchmark for flying-fox populations in 2013 and monitor trends in abundance and distribution in subsequent years. Counts are carried out using a robust scientific methodology developed by the CSIRO Land and Water (this method is described at http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/391f5fed-e287-4dd3-85ac-640037926ef5/files/310112-monitoring-methodology.pdf,  http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/status-and-trends-australias-epbc-listed-flying-foxes). The first full NFFMP census of grey-headed flying-foxes took place on 14-16 February 2013 and was the most comprehensive survey ever undertaken for this species. \n\nThe NFFMP is coordinated by CSIRO Land and Water and Department of Environment in collaboration with the participating state governments.\n\nThis dataset contains all the flying-fox census data collected under the NFFMP (up to and including survey results reflected in the data revision date).\nRestricted\nThe long term ambition of the NFFMP is to make the data publicly available. However, at present the camps and counts data are not available for public release via direct data download. Aggregated data are displayed by an external facing WebGIS viewer. Data could be released for research purposes under standard licence by negotiation with NFFMP.\nDiscuss any use of the data with NFFMP body",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2016. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "<b>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</b>\n\nRiver and Creek Flooding \n\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\n\n\n\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside. \n\n\n\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i> Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions - with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage. \n\n<i>Purpose</i>: To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n\n<i>Methodology:</i> Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations. <i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i> \n\n<i>Flood Height: </i>Indicates the\napproximate water surface level of potential inundation during a\ncomputer-modelled flood event, expressed in meters above mean sea level. This dataset\nrepresents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of\n0.2m.\n\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i> The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is: 5% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year\n\n<i>Likelihood: LikelyAnnual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i>\n\n<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n\nA small flood event that may be observed from time to time. Over a very long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 20 years. Although unusual, an event of this size can occur more frequently. It is likely an event of this size will occur more than once during a single lifetime. The river and creek flood event that occurred in the middle reaches of Burpengary Creek during May 2009 was similar in size to this event.\n\n<i>Version Notes 3.1.0</i> - First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE. (October 2023)\n\n<i>Version Resolution: 2.5m</i>\n\n<i>Data Reliability: A </i>\n\n<i>Indicates the flood data is of the highest available standard and has been prepared using the most recent flood model and input data</i>\n\n<i>Further Information: </i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website: <a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding</a>  ",

    "title": "Review of Lagoon Entrance Modelling for Flood Studies",
    "description": "Separate Flood studies have been undertaken for four coastal lagoons in the Gosford area, that is, Avoca, Cockrone, Terrigal and Wamberal Lagoons.\n\nDifferent analytical approaches have been used for Avoca-Cockrone and Terrigal-Wamberal Lagoons. The physical processes involved in the break-out of the lagoons through the beach are complex. Thus, there is a potential for the different analytical processes to produce significantly different results.\n\nFor this study, separate MIKE-11 models were established for Terrigal-Wamberal Lagoons. These models were calibrated against the documented openings of August and September 1993.\n\nMIKE-11 models have been previously established for Avoca and Cockrone Lagoons as part of the Flood Studies.\n\nThe Avoca Lagoon hydraulic model established for the flood study was modified to remove the source of numerical noise which resulted in the over-estimation of the volume of water discharged to the ocean during the opening calibration event. The re-calibration did not alter the parameters for initial breakout of the lagoon.\n\nThe amendment of channel lengths in the Avoca model was also undertaken to remove a minor over-estimation of storage. The revised hydraulic model produced an estimated one percent AEP design flood level 20mm lower than that obtained in the flood study. This variation in estimated flood levels is not considered significant.\n\nIt is noted that the critical duration storm (that is, the design storm that produces the greatest water level in the lagoon) was the 9 hour storm for each lagoon.\n\nThe design flood level estimates for the one percent AEP flood in Terrigal Lagoon and Wamberal Lagoon determined by the review hydraulic model were within 30mm of the flood study estimates. This can be considered to provide independent verification of the flood study estimates.",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \n\nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

Our previous observations show that FRB 20190520B is not only among the most active FRBs that can be observed with Murriyang, but also shows extreme rotation measure (RM) and dispersion measure (DM) evolution, along with distinctive behavior at 3GHz frequency. This makes the UWL receiver uniquely suited for detailed studies and long-term monitoring of this repeating FRB. Through this program, we anticipate detecting a large sample of bursts from this FRB. In collaboration with FAST, we aim to investigate the time evolution of various properties of FRB 20190520B, enhance our understanding of polarisation across an extremely wide bandwidth with high sensitivity, and gain deeper insights into the local environment and emission mechanisms of FRBs.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the school zones for Secondary schools in Victoria with the Year 9 curriculum for the year of 2020.\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have enrolment zones. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nDesignated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. Closest proximity is calculated as the nearest school by straight line distance in metropolitan areas (including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo), or the nearest school by shortest practical route (in regional areas). Zones were produces in Datum 1994 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight line distance and calculations using road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap road network layer were used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe zones of schools defined as metropolitan have taken preference over the zones of regional schools where they interface. A small number of zones have been restricted by the Minister for Education to support schools in managing their enrolments. Some schools zones have been aligned with structural and geographic barriers recognising the significant accessibility issues they impose. School enrolment zones are reviewed annually and updated as government school provision changes. The school zone dataset is comprised of distinct map layers for primary schools and for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools.\nFor more information please visit the Victorian Government Data Portal or the Find My School website.\nPlease note: \n\nThe Victorian school zone layers can be used in conjunction with the Victorian school location layers.\n",

    "description": "Collaborative government geoscience programs deliver data and information on Australia’s natural resources. Precompetitive geoscience is publicly available data and information that is shared freely by government for the benefit of all stakeholders. For the resources industry, precompetitive geoscience helps reduce investment risk and increases the odds of making a successful discovery during exploration. It comes before private sector exploration and investment, not instead of it.\n\nGovernments deliver precompetitive geoscience through integrated and complementary regional- to national-scale data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation studies of mineral and energy resource potential. Geoscience Australia works to support many stakeholders from the Australian Government, State and Territory Geological Surveys, industry, academia and communities. This ensures that reliable information is available to make informed decisions, and to establish and maintain a pipeline of exploration and development projects that can provide the raw materials needed for the production of renewable energy technologies (such as solar panels, wind turbines), electric vehicles, advanced manufacturing and defence technologies and capabilities.\n\nGeoscience Australia’s current program has several initiatives specifically supporting the minerals sector. Resourcing Australia's Prosperity aims to comprehensively map Australia’s natural resources and accelerate the discovery of critical minerals and is a major federal government initiative. The Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub, which concludes in June 2026, is focused on industry prioritised research in collaboration with CSIRO and ANSTO. The Critical Minerals Mapping Initiative leverages international expertise to improve mineral prospectivity techniques and will feed into the Resourcing Australia's Prosperity initiative.\n\nThe outcome of this work provides trusted scientific evidence and advice that directly supports the Australian Government’s policies and strategic priorities as well as mapping the nations mineral potential and other resources needed to support the energy transition​. A thriving and sustainable resources exploration industry accelerates investment, resource development and a stronger economy.\n\nPresented at the 2025 Society of Economic Geologists (SEG) Conference",

    "description": "Current issue 23/09/2020\nPlease note: Sensors 67, 68 and 69 are showing duplicate records. We are currently working on a fix to resolve this.\n\nThis dataset contains minute by minute directional pedestrian counts for the last hour from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated every 15 minutes and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.\nThe sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with the Sensor Locations dataset which details the location, status and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical pedestrian counting data.\nNote this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every minute as sensor devices only create a record when one or more pedestrians have passed underneath the sensor. \nThe Pedestrian Counting System helps us to understand how people use different city locations at different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future. A representation of pedestrian volume which compares each location on any given day and time can be found in our Online Visualisation.\nRelated datasets: Pedestrian Counting System – 2009 to Present (counts per hour).Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2011.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. \n\n\n\nThe surface water component of the ZoPHC is derived from the reaches that are deemed impacted from the surface water modelled (sometimes referred to as Step 1 reaches) as well as additional non modelled reaches that are deemed to be potentially impacted due to interactions with the GW drawdown layer (aka Step 2) or proposed mine operations at the surface (aka Step 3).  How these are derived is expanded on in the History section of the metadata.\n\n\n\nThe SW ZoPHC is created from AU cells that intersect any of the impacted stream lines (from steps 1-3 above) as well as those which intersect GDE landscapeclass singlepart polygons withing 150m of the impacted stream lines.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing edits were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells. Mostly these occurred in the Macquarie-Tuggerah region of the ZoPHC to exclude AU cells selected due to intersecting upslope rainforest and wet schlerophyll forest GDE polygons in narrow valley areas.\n\n\n\nThe dataset contains the HUN_ZoPHC_source_AU_master_20171115.shp. It is the same as the previous one except that it has the additional field \"RIM_reason\" which identifies an AU as to what RIM analysis is subject to (eg \"forested wetlands\"). As before, it also contains the input component layers that were used to define the SW ZoPHC. They being \n\n1)      the bits of SW_Modelling reaches (above) that showed modelled or assumed change plus the additional rch_200 and rch_300 reaches\n\n2)      GDEs used to identify riparian AUs not intersected by the streamlines above but to be included in the SW ZoPHC.\n\n\n\nImportantly the ZoPHC_source_AU_master contains the reach id to which an Assessment Unit (AU) is allocated. \n\n\n\nImportant note:  an AU is only allocated to a reach if it is within the SW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nThis accounts for why there are some AUs that have a modelled reach passing through them but have a NULL \"allocreach\" value. It is because they are not in the SW ZoPHC. This will usually be because the reach shows  modelled \"no change\" or there is presumed no change due to the reach not being hydrologically connected to any ACRD activity. However there are some AUs that have been deemed by expert judgement to be not in the SW Zone because existing Baseline activity has nullified the potential ACRD impacts.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nA CON statement in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst was used to extract the area of the 95th quantile (HUN_dmax_acrd_quantile_95.asc from the input dataset) raster layer where drawdown was >= 0.2m. The resulting integer zone grid was vectorised into a shapefile. An anomalous zone on the SW boundary of the subregion that was an artefact of the modelling was deleted. The result is the GW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nSW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nthe outputs of the processes below can be found in the \"Input_Component_Layers\" folder of this dataset.\n\n\n\nStep 1\n\nPotentially impacted reaches were extracted from HUN_SW_Modelling_InterpolatedReaches_Network_20170220_v02.shp (source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). These are line features where \"SW_ZoPHC\" = 'yes' or 'part'. From these extracted \"impacted\" reaches, the line features classified as \"part\" were manually edited (cut) according to the description in the HRV (Hydrological Response Variables) LUT spreadsheet (HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02.xlsx in source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). This typically involved trimming the line back only to that in or downstream of the GW ZoPHC extent. Also some \"part\" impacted line features were cut where they intersected existing (i.e. baseline) open cut pits (OC). These excisions were done onscreen by eye, with reference to OC pit polygons used for modelling and existing mine workings shown in Google Earth imagery. The result after this trimming of selected features is the shapefile Step_1_SW_Model_ImpactedReaches_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp\n\n\n\nStep  2\n\nStreams other than \"highly intermittent ephemeral\" in the Hunter Perenniality layer, that where inside or downstream of the GW ZoPHC were selected and underwent the same Baseline open pit excision process as above. This became the Step_2_NonEphemeral_Streams_affected_by_GW_drawdown_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile. Note that some streams identified by Step 2 are already described in SW model (i.e. are included in the Step 1 features)\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\"highly intermittent ephemeral\" streams from the Hunter Perenniality layer that were inside or downstream of ACRD open cut pits (based on the GW model ACRD OC footprint polygons) were selected. This became the Step_3_Ephemeral_Streams_crossing_ACRD_pits_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile.\n\n\n\nUsing the three \"impacted\" stream layers derived above in conjunction with a singlepart shapefile, the final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and surface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) HUN ZoPHC and component layers 20171115.

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nHunter Zone of Potential Hydrological change including input  and derived layers.\n\n\n\nThe final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and suface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.  The groundwater component of the ZPHC is where the the probability 5% or greater of  equalling or exceeding 0.2m drawdown and is derived from the 95th Quantile layer. \n\n\n\nThe surface water component of the ZoPHC is derived from the reaches that are deemed impacted from the surface water modelled (sometimes referred to as Step 1 reaches) as well as additional non modelled reaches that are deemed to be potentially impacted due to interactions with the GW drawdown layer (aka Step 2)  or proposed mine operations at the surface (aka Step 3).  How these are derived  are expanded on in the History section of the metadata.\n\n\n\nThe SW ZoPHC is created from AU cells that intersect any of the impacted stream lines (from steps 1-3 above) as well as those which intersect GDE landscapeclass singlepart polygons withing 150m of the impacted stream lines.\n\n\n\nSome manual post processing edits were undertaken to remove anomalous AU cells. Mostly these occurred in the Macquarie-Tuggerah region of the ZoPHC to exclude AU cells selected due to intersecting upslope rainforest and wet schlerophyll forest GDE polygons in narrow valley areas.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nA CON statement in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst was used to extract the area of the 95th quantile (HUN_dmax_acrd_quantile_95.asc from the input dataset) raster layer where drawdown was >= 0.2m. The resulting integer zone grid was vectorised into a shapefile. An anomalous zone on the SW boundary of the subregion that was an artefact of the modelling was deleted. The result is the GW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nSW ZoPHC\n\n\n\nthe outputs of the processes below can be found in the \"Input_Component_Layers\" folder of this dataset.\n\n\n\nStep 1\n\nPotentially impacted reaches were extracted from HUN_SW_Modelling_InterpolatedReaches_Network_20170220_v02.shp (source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). These are line features where \"SW_ZoPHC\" = 'yes' or 'part'. From these extracted \"impacted\" reaches, the line features classified as \"part\" were manually edited (cut) according to the description in the HRV (Hydrological Response Variables) LUT spreadsheet (HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02.xlsx in source dataset: HUN_SW_Modelling_Reaches_and_HRV_lookup_20170221_v02). This typically involved trimming the line back only to that in or downstream of the GW ZoPHC extent. Also some \"part\" impacted line features were cut where they intersected existing (i.e. baseline) open cut pits (OC). These excisions were done onscreen by eye, with reference to OC pit polygons used for modelling and existing mine workings shown in Google Earth imagery. The result after this trimming of selected features is the shapefile Step_1_SW_Model_ImpactedReaches_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp\n\n\n\nStep  2\n\nStreams other than \"highly intermittent ephemeral\" in the Hunter Perenniality layer, that where inside or downstream of the GW ZoPHC were selected and underwent the same Baseline open pit excision process as above. This became the Step_2_NonEphemeral_Streams_affected_by_GW_drawdown_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile. Note that some streams identified by Step 2 are already described in SW model (i.e. are included in the Step 1 features)\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\"highly intermittent ephemeral\" streams from the Hunter Perenniality layer that were inside or downstream of ACRD open cut pits (based on the GW model ACRD OC footprint polygons) were selected. This became the Step_3_Ephemeral_Streams_crossing_ACRD_pits_modified_for_SWZoPHC_defiition.shp shapefile.\n\n\n\nUsing the three \"impacted\" stream layers derived above in conjunction with a singlepart shapefile The final Zone of Potential Hydrological Change (ZPHC) is a union of the groundwater ZPHC and surface water ZPHC, which in turn were derived from groundwater and surface water impact modelling.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) HUN ZoPHC and component layers 20170220.

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study Blunder Sub-Model. This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\n\"The image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2015. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

As part of this update, the previous data API has been decommissioned. While the datasets remain accessible, they may no longer be fully functional, and are currently under review.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.bnefoodtrucks.com.au\">Brisbane Food Trucks website</a> is a one-stop-shop for gourmet food trucks. The website allows food truck operators to create profiles, upload menu information and take advantage of GPS technology to enable customers to track their location.\n\nTo help third parties promote Brisbane Food Trucks, we have enabled a data API. This release is one-way data feed only. The intent of the API is to allow external parties to replicate the mapping feature provided by the site.\n\nThis dataset provides the details loaded by food truck operators to their profile page and was created using the API. Data is used to build both map pins and the custom truck landing pages on Brisbane Food Trucks.\n\nTo access and view the data in the source API or see additional information use the links in the Data and Resources section below.",

    "description": "This study investigated seasonal variation in the abundances and size distribution of shrimp species in Western Port Bay, Victoria from July 1977 to January 1980. Four species, Macrobrachium intermedium, Pontophilus candidus, Hippolyte caradina and Chlorotocella leptorhyncus, were sampled using a beam trawl as described in the record 'The ecology and trophic role of caridean shrimps in the eelgrass community of Western Port, Victoria' (File identifier: 268431c0-f18e-11dc-aaae-00188b4c0af8). Individuals in each sample were counted, identified, sexed, size measured (total length, carapace length), and reproductive state of females noted. The relationship between body size and ash-free dry mass was obtained in order to calculate the standing crop and productivity of each species. \n\nM.intermedium was the numerically dominant shrimp species in the eelgrass. Mean densities of P.intermedius and H.cardian were 20-50% and 3-4% less abundant than M.intermedium, respectively. Maximum abundances of M. intermedium and P.intermedius occurred early in the year and coincided with the recruitment of large numbers of juveniles. Densities of H.caradina showed high variability between years.   Low capture efficiency of C.leptorhyncus meant that this species was excluded from the analyses.",

It is simply the ratio of water volume to soil volume.- ºC: Temperature in degrees celsius.- µS/cm: Salinity is the measure of the concentration of dissolved (soluble) salts in water from all sources. (microseimens per centimetre)Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every hour as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value.

    "title": "Notifiable Invoices Register",
    "description": "In accordance with the Government Procurement Act 2001, from 1 July 2015, the Government is publishing relevant information about its notifiable invoices.  The requirement is consistent with Open Government and applies to all Territory entities.  The Notifiable Invoices Register, in conjunction with the ACT Government Contracts Register provides transparency about Government purchasing to the community. \n\nNotifiable Invoices are invoices with a value of $25,000 or more for goods, services or works received by the Territory or a Territory entity.  The Territory publishes details of notifiable invoices within 21 days after the end of the month in which the invoice was paid.         \n\nFor reporting from July 1 2017, the Territory will be including date invoice received in the notifiable invoices register.  A number of points should be taken into account when using this information:          \n - For the June 2017 reporting period, this field is the date that a valid invoice was received by the responsible Territory entity, however in small number of cases, it relates to the date the invoices was initially entered into the financial processing system of the Territory entity where known.        \n - A small proportion of notifiable invoices do not have date received information recorded.  This is due to a variety of reasons including some cases of scheduled payments under agreements or contracts not having an explicit invoice received date, and several reporting entities not yet being able to transmit to the Territory central finance system the date invoice received.\n\nA new column titled ‘Procurement Unique Identifier’ has been added to the Notifiable Invoices Register.  An initiative of the Procurement Reform Program to improve transparency of government procurement and contracting, the Procurement Unique Identifier was launched for new procurements entering into the planning phase in April 2023 to facilitate linkage of procurement activities across the procurement lifecycle. The Procurement Unique Identifier can be searched in the ‘Contract Number’ or ‘Contract Title’ field in the Notifiable Contracts Register. \n\nReporting Entity Key  \nACT Legal Aid:  ACT Legal Aid Commission\nACTAO:  ACT Audit Office\nACTIA:  ACT Insurance Authority\nACTIC:  ACT Integrity Commission\nBCIFA:  Building and Construction Industry Fund Authority\nCFC:    Cultural Facilities Corporation\nCMTEDD-SPA:     Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate - Superannuation Provision Account\nCMTEDD-TBA:     Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate - Territory Banking Account\nICRC:   Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission\nLSLA:   ACT Long Service Leave Authority\nLTCS:   Lifetime Care and Support Fund ACT\nMAI:    Motor Accident Injuries Commission\nOLA:    Office of the Legislative Assembly\nPTG:    Public Trustee and Guardian for the Australian Capital Territory\nTCCS-Canberra Cemeteries:   Canberra Memorial Parks/Australian Capital Territory Public Cemeteries Authority\nTQI:    Teachers Quality Institute\nACT Ombudsman:  ACT Ombudsman\nACT Electoral:  ACT Electoral Commission\nAHD:    ACT Health Directorate\nCHS:    Canberra Health Services\nCIT:    Canberra Institute of Technology\nCMTEDD:     Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate\nCMTEDD-ACT Exec:    ACT Executive\nCMTEDD-DDTS-ICT:    Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate- Digital, Data and Technology Solutions\nCMTEDD-ED:  Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate - Economic Development\nCMTEDD-SS:  Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate - Shared Services\nCRA:    City Renewal Authority\nCSD:    Community Services Directorate\nCSD-Housing:    Community Services Directorate - Housing ACT\nEPSDD:  Environment Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate\nETD:    Education Directorate\nGRC:    ACT Gambling &amp; Racing Commission\nJACSD:  Justice and Community Safety Directorate\nMPC:    Major Projects Canberra\nSLA:    Suburban Land Agency\nWorksafeACT: Office of th",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne Social Indicators Survey (CoMSIS) was conducted for the first time in 2018. The survey collects data, annually, about the state of health, well-being, participation and connection of communities in the Melbourne Local Government Area, primarily to report on key Council Plan 2017-21 municipal outcome indicators. \nThis dataset provides indicator results for 1,212 residents surveyed via telephone and online. Data has been provided by suburb, gender and age groups and has been weighted according to population proportions.  Responses such as don't know, not sure, not applicable etc. were excluded in the calculation of indicators.  The sample sizes shown reflect this accordingly.",

We aim to explore the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through the application of the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained across a wide bandwidth spanning 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. Emission heights will be measured using both the delay-radius and geometrical\n  methods to examine their frequency dependence and test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of different profile components will be conducted to constrain pulsar emission properties, while pulse intensity modulations will be analyzed to identify potential phase-lock phenomena. Our study will provide more information on the understanding of the properties of pulsars with IP emissions.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThe Gippsland database V2.1 supersedes the previous version (Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 10 September 2015, GUID: 45261e4b-fbd9-4853-bb16-2bf8c47bf018) which was found to contain errors. \n\nThis database (v2.1) should be considered as the update to v1.5 Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 16 June 2015, GUID: 178b98b7-3107-4cbf-b7ea-fc648c6f5870). \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains v2.1  of the Asset database (GIP_asset_database_20150918.mdb), a Geodatabase version for GIS mapping purposes (GIP_asset_database_20150918_GISOnly.gdb), an updated Water Dependent Asset Register spreadsheet (BA-GIP-ALL-130-WaterDependentAssetRegister-AssetList-V20150918.xlsx), a data dictionary (GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc), and a folder (NRM_DOC) containing documentation associated with the WAIT process as outlined below.\n\n\n\nUnder the BA program, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Gippsland are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. Elements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the bioregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Gippsland bioregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database both M1 and M3 have been assessed. Assets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA program. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc\", located in the zip file as part of this dataset.The \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset.Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \" GIP_asset_database_doc_20150918.doc\" located in the zip file.Some of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted. \n\n\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe Asset List Database was developed to identify water dependent assets located within the Gippsland Basin bioregion.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate_\tNotes\n\n1\t9/12/2014\tInitial database.\n\n1.2\t30/01/2015\t\n\nDatabase updated with elements and assets derived from additional source datasets: Economic_SW; VICADV_VulnFauna and Flora; Plantation Forests; Irrigation Districts; Inundation    100 year flood extent; Landscape Priority Areas (West); Farm Dam boundaries.\n\n\n\n1.3\t12/02/2015\tAIDs updated for new assets (existing AID + 20000) to avoid duplication of AIDs used in databases for other subregions.\n\n\n\n1.4\t9/06/2015\t\n\n(1) Previous groundwater, surface water, GMA and WSPA assets (sources: VIC_DEPI_ECON_GW, Vic_Surfacewater Licences Economic Asset Data, ECON_GW_VIC_GMA and ECON_GW_VIC_WSPA respectively) were turned off (i.e. the field of InRegister in table AssetList   has a value No). Theirs AIDs are from 16696 to 16706, 12006 to 12015 and 46598 to 46759.\n\n(2) New groundwater, surface water, GMA and WSPA assets (sources: VIC_DEPI_ECON_GW_May2015, VIC_DEPI_ECON_SW_May2015, VIC_ECON_GW_GMA and VIC_ECON_WSPA) were added in\n\n(3) New surface water polygon SDL data, which was also used to group surface water elements to assets, was added in. The new AIDs for (2) and (3) are from 46894 to 479081 inclusive\n\n(4)One previous asset (AID: 12729) is duplicated to one asset in MBC (AID: 11636) . its AID, Asset Name, Group, SubGroup, Depth, Source, ListDate and Geometry is using values from that MBC asset.\n\n(5) The name of one asset (AID: 15546) was changed because its previous name may be not for publication\n\n(6) The databases, especially spatial   database, were changed such as duplicated attributes fields in spatial data were removed and only ID field is kept.\"\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n(1) Change title to Asset database for the Gippsland Basin bioregion on 16 June 2015 from subregion to bioregion\n\n(2) Update new AIDs (from 46894 to 47081 inclusive) on09/06/2015 to new AIDs (66894 to 67081inclusive): new \\[AID\\]=Previous \\[AID\\]+20000\"\n\n\n\nv2   10/9/2015   ERRORS IDENTIFIED\n\n(1) The explanations for M2 decisions have been updated based on advice from the project team.

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The e-atlas data we have provided is site means… i.e.. the mean of those 25 values. \r\n- LCC - Live coral cover (percent cover), live hard and soft coral pooled.\r\n- LHC - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n- MAC - Macro Algae Cover % (fleshy algas only, does not include turf algae)\r\n- Fish Line_SUM - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. = total number of lines/1500m2.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.\tWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans, R.D., Jones, G.P., Russ, G.R.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with imaging costs, and out-of-pocket cost per diagnostic imaging service attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nDiagnostic imaging services are Medicare-subsidised diagnostic imaging procedures such as x-rays, computerised tomography scans, ultrasound scans, magnetic resonance imaging scans and nuclear medicine scans.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This proposal aims to constrain burst rates and spin down properties of a sample of new Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) discovered with the ASKAP CRAFT Coherent upgrade (CRACO) system. Over the past 12-months of commissioning, CRACO discovered and precisely localised 15 new RRATs, characterised by their sporadic pulses with dispersion measures (DM) consistent with Galactic sources. We request 22.5h of Parkes time split into three 30min observations spanning 6-months for each target. This can help constrain periods and potentially phase-coherent timing solutions given that we already have arcsec-precision interferometric localisations. Our main science goals are: 1) to measure their burst rates, periods, and spin-down properties; 2) to assess their nulling fraction and intermittency; 3) to measure their polarimetric properties and constrain their emission mechanism; 4) to determine if the CRACO RRATs are fundamentally different from the known RRAT population. Some of these goals can be answered even with the detection of a limited number of pulses.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",
