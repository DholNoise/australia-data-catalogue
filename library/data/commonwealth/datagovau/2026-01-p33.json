    "title": "NSW Land Parcel Property Theme - Lot -  Multi CRS",
    "description": "Content TitleLot BoundariesContent TypeHosted Feature LayerDescriptionNSW Land Parcel and Property Theme MultiCRS - Lot is a polygon feature that defines a parcel of land created on a survey plan. Parcel polygons are defined by a series of boundary lines that store recorded dimensions as attributes in the lines table. It visualises these boundaries of land parcels, often buildings on land, the parcel identifier, and basic topographic features.NSW Land Parcel and Property Theme provides the foundation fabric of land ownership.  It consists of the digital cadastral database and associated parcel and property information.NSW Land Parcel and Property Theme Lot is made up of the following features within the NSW Land Parcel and Property Theme.Cadastral Fabric – LotLot - Depicts a parcel of land created on a survey plan. Each lot may be represented by standard lots, standard part lots, strata or stratum. Each lot has a lot number, section number, plan lot area, plan number, plan label, Integrated Titling System (ITS) title status, and stratum label.Land and property data underpins the economic, social and environmental fabric of NSW and is used, amongst other things, to:<ul><li>Secure tenure for access to capital</li><li>Define allowable use of land</li><li>Manage native title, nature conservation, heritage, protection, defence, and disaster management</li><li>Improve infrastructure and property development planning</li><li>Inform water and carbon accounting programs</li></ul>Spatial Services continuously updates the Land Parcel and Property theme with information sourced from relevant stakeholders and custodians. The majority of updates to the datasets in this theme originate from subdivision, registration and gazettal activity.The data is up to date to within 10 working days from when a plan is lodged at NSW Land Registry Services. Data is also sourced from Crown Lands, the Office of Environment and Heritage, the Aboriginal Land Council, Local Land Services, the Electoral Commission and NSW Trade and Investment.The Cadastral upgrade program commenced in 2007 and is ongoing, improving the spatial accuracy of different feature classes. Upgrades are carried out in consultation with the relevant Local Government Authority and are further facilitated through the incorporation of data provided by external agencies. Upgrade positional accuracy varies across the state and generally ranges from less than 5m from true position in rural areas to less than 0.2m from true position in urban areas, dependent on the survey control available.Data quality for both Cadastral Maintenance and Cadastral Upgrade activities are assured through specification compliance and data topology rules. The client delivery database is automatically updated each evening with the changes that occurred that day in the maintenance environment.Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA94Spatial Reference System (web service)OtherWGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentFull stateContent LineagePlease contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Data ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityPlease contact us via the <a href=\"https://customerhub.spatial.nsw.gov.au/servicedesk/customer/portals\">Spatial Services Customer Hub</a>Terms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "Raster layer delineates the level of uncertainty depending on the data spatial mix (whether it contains mosaics or is Pure).\nGeneral Background: The National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) has been developed over the last 15 years from a variety of data sources. The commonwealth is reliant on states and territories to supply vegetation data, which is then collated into the NVIS. Because of varying levels of resources available to different regions, the data they are able to supply is of varying scale, age, origin and spatial mix. \nNVIS is widely used by various organisation including, researchers, NGO and governments, for a wide range of uses such as modelling, fire fuel loads and policy. To improve the interpretation of the NVIS dataset the Dept of the Environment & Energy has developed a suite of uncertainty layers and tools to facilitate the robust use of the NVIS.\nAim: to develop a raster Uncertainty layer that is intended to better describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS extant theme dataset.\nOutput: raster files scaled 0-1 that can be used for uncertainty, including data age, origin, scale and spatial mix. The layers can be added together to form one uncertainty layer. Python script/tools will also be provided so individuals can develop their own uncertainty layers and to be as transparent as possible.\nThe Uncertainty layers comprise 5 rasters, 1 composite and 5 individual layers:\n                 -      NVIS Uncertainty layer (composite of 4 below layers)\n                 -      Age: age of the NVIS data\n                 -      Origin: where the data came from\n                 -      Spatial mix: if the data is a mosaic\n                 -      Scale: scale that the data was mapped\nAge, scale, origin and spatial mix Information is supplied by the states and territories as part of the NVIS resupply process.\nThis dataset represents a scale of uncertainty in relation to data spatial mix. Scale categories are below.\nTable 1.

Students in SSPs are reported according to the type of specific need rather than by their year of schooling. Students with multiple disabilities are reported according to their main disability. \n\n\nMost SSPs have permanent enrolments and include schools for students with intellectual (mild, moderate and severe) and physical disabilities, visual or hearing impairment, behaviour disorders or emotional disturbance, and students in juvenile justice centres. \n\n\nSome SSPs have no permanent enrolments because the children temporarily attending them are enrolled and counted in their own schools. These are mainly hospital schools. Some students with specific needs are enrolled in support classes in primary, secondary and central schools. Students enrolled in support classes are reported according to the type of specific need rather than by their year of schooling. Support classes for students of mixed abilities are classified according to the predominant type of specific need present in the class.\n\n\nStudents in SSPs, except those in juvenile justice schools, are reported by the type of support class they are enrolled in, not by the type of SSP.\n\n\nFrom 2020, students in mainstream support classes are reported by their underlying grade of enrolment.\n\n\nData has been confidentialised where necessary to suppress enrolments of 5 or fewer students, indicated by an asterisk (*).\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

    "title": "Antarctica - Wilkes Land ice velocity from over_snow traverse Doppler Satellite Position data",
    "description": "Measurements of ice velocity on the surface of the ice sheet in Wilkes Land East Antarctica were made along the routes of oversnow traverses operating out of Casey (66.6 S 110 E).  In general, measurements were made at a nominal spacing of 50 km.  Additional measurements were made at closer spacing in some areas in order to resolve finer scale variation in the flow pattern.  Three main routes were covered: two routes (east at latitude 69 S and west at latitude 68.5 S) approximately followed the line of the 2000 m elevation contour, and a third route headed south from summit of Law Dome ice cap along the line to Vostok station.\n\nAll velocity data were derived from positions determined using Doppler Satellite Positioning techniques with data collected from the (US) NAVSAT systems using JMR receivers, with the doppler data processed in combination with Precise Ephemeris data supplied by the (US) DMAHTC and the DOPPLR software packages.  Processing of the data were carried out by the Australian Division of National Mapping.\n\nThe time interval between first and last position observations was three years for the western route, six years for the southern route, and three to five years for the eastern route.\n\nThese data form part of the data collected for ASAC projects 458 (Characteristics, Dynamics and Mass Budget of the Ice Sheet in Wilkes Land) and 2224 (Glacier dynamics and mass discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet, 45 degrees -160 degrees E) - (ASAC_458, ASAC_2224).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nsite_id (identifier code for the measurement station)\n\nlatitude\n\nlongitude\n\nspeed (speed of ice velocity, units unknown)\n\nazimuth (direction of ice velocity, in degrees. 0=northwards movement, 90=eastwards movement)\n\nThe printouts from the recording and reduction of the doppler observations have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nAll logbooks have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.\n\nCopies of the document details forms for the logbooks are available for download from the provided URL.",

    "description": "Raster layer delineates the level of uncertainty depending on the data age. \nGeneral Background: The National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) has been developed over the last 15 years from a variety of data sources. The commonwealth is reliant on states and territories to supply vegetation data, which is then collated into the NVIS. Because of varying levels of resources available to different regions, the data they are able to supply is of varying scale, age, origin and spatial mix. \nNVIS is widely used by various organisation including, researchers, NGO and governments, for a wide range of uses such as modelling, fire fuel loads and policy. To improve the interpretation of the NVIS dataset the Dept of the Environment & Energy has developed a suite of uncertainty layers and tools to facilitate the robust use of the NVIS.\nAim: to develop a raster Uncertainty layer that is intended to better describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS extant theme dataset.\nOutput: raster files scaled 0-1 that can be used for uncertainty, including data age, origin, scale and spatial mix. The layers can be added together to form one uncertainty layer. Python script/tools will also be provided so individuals can develop their own uncertainty layers and to be as transparent as possible.\nThe Uncertainty layers comprise 5 rasters, 1 composite and 5 individual layers:\n                 -      NVIS Uncertainty layer (composite of 4 below layers)\n                 -      Age: age of the NVIS data\n                 -      Origin: where the data came from\n                 -      Spatial mix: if the data is a mosaic\n                 -      Scale: scale that the data was mapped\nAge, scale, origin and spatial mix Information is supplied by the states and territories as part of the NVIS resupply process.\nThis dataset represents a scale of uncertainty in relation to data age. Scale categories are below.\nTable 1.

    "description": "This report presents detailed financial performance of slaughter lamb producing farms in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 and discusses productivity in a historical context. The report was commissioned by Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) and expands on results that were published in  Agricultural Commodities (March quarter 2015)  and the  Australian farm survey results 2012-13 to 2014-15  report released in March 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Most farms producing lambs for slaughter are mixed enterprises, deriving receipts from cropping, beef cattle, sheep and wool and from the sale of slaughter lambs. \r\n• Farm cash income of specialist slaughter lamb producing farms, those farms most reliant on lamb production, is estimated to have increased from an average of $80 900 a farm in 2013-14 to $98 300 a farm in 2014-15. This increase was mainly a result of higher prices for lambs and sheep. \r\n• Farm cash incomes and business profit of all slaughter lamb producers are estimated to have fallen in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14. Reduced grain production in 2014-15 is estimated to have resulted in lower average total receipts of slaughter lamb producing farms despite an increase in sheep and lamb receipts mainly a result of increased prices. Average farm cash income of slaughter lamb producers is estimated to have declined by 8 per cent from an average of $180 100 a farm in 2013-14 to $166 000 a farm in 2014-15, in real terms. \r\n• Farm debt of slaughter lamb producing farms averaged $649 577 a farm in 2013-14, slightly more than that in 2012-13 ($641 400). Farm debt is estimated to have reduced in 2014-15 compared with 2013-14 as a result of loan repayment and reductions in new borrowings. \r\n• Asset values and new investment remain high for slaughter lamb producing farms and while debt is also high, equity ratios and debt servicing are in line with long-term averages. \r\n",

    "description": "Vectorized version of the Land Monitor Salinity Extent – South West of Western Australia 1998 dataset.\n\nSalinity mapped in raster format with 25-m pixels. The Land Monitor salinity mapping process uses satellite imagery, high-resolution topographic data, ground information and ancillary GIS data sets to map areas of severely salt-affected land identified in consecutive satellite (Landsat TM) scenes (Furby et al 2010). To update the 1990 and 1998 estimates, the spatial-temporal methodology was re-applied using the same approach but took advantage of the latest data and improved computational resources (Caccetta et al 2022). Any changes in the extent of salt affected land detected by Land Monitor in the updated salinity mapping are most likely within the severe salinity class and may represent either expansions of this class of salinity or improvements in the condition of severely salt affected land or in the reduction of commission errors (compared to the original mapping).\n\nThis data has converted the salt effected areas to a vector geodatabase. Additional post processing to remove urban areas has been applied.",

    "description": "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal:- https://portal.aodn.org.au. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledgment all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in December 2010, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "This data was collected in may and june 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS072008.\n\nDeparted: \tNoumea, New Caledonia, April 30, 2008\nArrived:  \tSuva, Fiji, June 6, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.5ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. The travel time and warming in the two lines is very similar. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

This data has not been validated, and some records and species identification may be under further investigation.\n\nThe increased reporting of TEP interactions is a direct result of the mandatory NX IOM program, in conjunction with improved education, identification, handling, and reporting of protected species with industry.\n\nFisheries Queensland monitors all interactions reported by fishers through the Threatened, Endangered and Protected (TEP) logbook. Protected species interactions, and in particular mortalities in all East Coast Inshore Finfish fisheries are managed in line with the approved Protected Species Management Strategy (PSMS), July 2021. This strategy outlines the prioritised protected species and are subjected to appropriate response dependent on category identified in the policy. This species list can be found in Table 5 of the PSMS.",

    "description": "**This dataset has been superseded by the *Forests of Australia (2023)*. For further information please see:**\r\nhttps://data.gov.au/data/dataset/forests-of-australia-2023\r\n\r\n*Forests of Australia (2018)* is a continental spatial dataset of forest extent, by national forest categories and types, assembled for *Australia's State of the Forests Report 2018*. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, \r\n including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as \"*An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands*\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and territory government agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to\r\nstate and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nThe NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) spatial dataset (2016), also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the Catchment scale Land Use and Management (CLUM) dataset (2016), was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map\r\nas forest.\r\n\r\nThe *Forests of Australia (2018)* dataset is produced to fulfil requirements of Australia's *National Forest Policy Statement* and the *Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002* (Cwth), and is used by the Australian Government for domestic and international reporting. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is updated every five years for the Australia's State of the Forests Report Series.

    "description": "In the mid-1920's Professor Theodore George Bentley  (TGB) Osborn, Professor of Botany in the University of Adelaide, put forward strong scientific arguments concerning the lack of knowledge of the ecology of arid zone vegetation, and the effect of grazing on it (Osborn, 1925). In 1925 negotiations proceeded between the University of Adelaide and Messrs Hamilton Wilcox Ltd to secure a parcel of land for the purposes of research on Koonamore Station, a sheep-grazing property approximately 400 km north-east of Adelaide.  A parcel of land of around 390ha was identified and fenced to exclude rabbits and other stock. The area was originally referred to as the Arid Region Flora Reserve but later was named the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve after its founder. For simplicity it is commonly referred to as the Koonamore Vegetation Reserve. \n \n\nThis record is a collection of flora and fauna observations conducted in the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve). \n\n\nThese records are organised accordingly :<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/90a26f3a-cf42-41e5-ada4-9b0166b15b09\">Vegetation Quadrats</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/05f37d50-935e-4a0a-b45e-cb1b606ce476\">Photopoints</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/c593e881-ddb4-408a-ba5d-6a5f9d258b39\"><em>Cassia</em> Corner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/aff278df-c8e8-41ab-b22e-66ea7d466169\"><em>Myoporum platycarpum</em> plant individuals</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/615b121a-3c4f-41b5-90f6-1b7e95ce7a9d\">Saltbush Transects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/d3e676a3-bf84-439f-ae99-0ce631ec6d64\">Senna Populations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/dfe1b721-19c1-4f88-91c3-23f438c6f531\">Kangaroo Transects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/TERN/e6448738-d870-432d-9795-955c90f6ee6e\">Rabbit Warren Monitoring</a> </li></ul>",

    "description": "An ArcGIS shapefile layer showing the extent of all extant and relic Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies on Shirley Island, Windmill Islands, February 2006. The field Status describes each polygon as extant, relic or maximum. Extant refers to the area used by breeding birds in the summer 2005/06. Maximum refers to the historic maximal extent of the colony. Relic refers to any colony which was not occupied by any breeding pairs during 2005/06.\r\n\r\nPositional accuracy is approx. 1-2 m, after accounting for dGPS errors and errors in identification of the boundaries of colonies. Mapping was conducted after the end of the breeding season, so boundaries were identified as the extent of nest pebbles/fresh faeces, and it was considered that they could be reliably identified to within 0.5m.\r\n\r\nData were acquired using a Trimble Pro XH differential GPS. This work was completed as part of ASAC project 1219 (ASAC_1219).\r\n\r\nWork on this project also utilised a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) created for Shirley Island.  See the metadata record, 'A digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto of Shirley Island, Windmill Islands, Antarctica' for more information (linked below).",

It provides a unique opportunity for researchers and policy makers to examine pathways and transitions of population groups, such as unemployed individuals transition into the labour force. Over time, the ACLD will continue to grow as records from each new Census are linked which will further enhance its longitudinal view. The ACLD will also be augmented in the future to take account of migration and births that occur between Censuses.",

    "description": "Dissolved oxygen in the water column is a primary input into the calculation of metabolism and respiration (refer Metabolism BASE Model dataset). Data loggers are deployed at multiple locations in the rivers of each of the Flow-MER Area-scale project to measure continuously at 10 minute intervals:\r\n* Light\r\n* Water temperature\r\n* Dissolve oxygen\r\n* Atmospheric pressure\r\n\r\nThe data record aims to be continuous over the summer water management period, however there are breaks in the data record due to high water levels preventing data retrieval and equipment losses.  There is generally at least one data logger deployed near locations where fish are also sampled.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\nReferences to the metabolism methods using these oxygen data:\r\nGrace MR, Giling DP, Hladyz S, Caron V, Thompson RM, Mac Nally R (2015) Fast processing of diel oxygen curves: estimating stream metabolism with BASE (BAyesian Single-station Estimation).

    "description": "The exposure of Great Barrier Reef coral reef and seagrass ecosystems to contaminants is estimated from the synthesis of: river discharge, water quality data sampled in inshore sites during flood conditions and the use of remote sensing technology to estimate flood plume extents and duration. \n\nRiver discharge: \nDaily mean, maximum and minimum river discharge (Megaliters/day) from 36 rivers, plus their quality control code (as in the DERM web page ¿Department of the Environment and Resource Management, Qld Government, http://watermonitoring.derm.qld.gov.au/host.htm) dated from 1915 (Barron River at Kuranda) up to current date. Rivers current in the data base are: Barron River at Kuranda, Calliope River at Castlehope, Mossman River at Mossman, Waterpark Creek at Byfield, Fitzroy River at The Gap, Kolan River at Springfield, Sandy Creek at Homebush, North Johnstone River at Tung Oil, Endeavour River at Flaggy, Daintree River at Bairds, O'Connell River at Caping Siding, Haughton River at Powerline, Murray River at Upper Murray, Mulgrave River at Peets Bridge, Tully River at Euramo, Baffle Creek at Mimdale, Black River at Bruce Highway, Carmila Creek At Carmila, Ross River at Ross River Dam Headwater, South Johnstone River at Upstream Central Mill, Burdekin River at Clare, Pioneer River at Mirani Weir Tailwater, Russell River at Bucklands, Mary River at Home Park, Barron River at Myola, Herbert River at Ingham, Don River at Reeves, Burrum River at Lenthalls Dam Release, Annan River at Beesbike, Proserpine River at Proserpine, Boyne River at Milton, Burnett River at Figtree Creek, Rocky Dam Ck, O'Connell River at Stafford's Crossing, Normanby River at Kalpower Crossing, and Pioneer River at Dumbleton Weir T/W.\n\nWater Quality: \nNear-shore water quality data has been measured from direct water mainly sampled at the surface, since 1991 as part of the Water Quality Monitoring Plan for the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Sometimes stratified samples using Niskin bottle has been also carried out.  Water samples are analyzed for: TSS (mg/l), chl-a (µg/l), phaeo-a (µg/l), cdom (440), Si (µM), DIP (µM), DOP (µM), TDP (µM), PP (µM), TP (µM), NO2 (µM), NO3 (µM), NOX (µM), NH4 (µM), DIN (µM), DON (µM), TDN (µM), PN (µM), TN (µM), POC (µM), DOC (µM), and the pesticides Ametryn, Atrazine, Bromacil, Desethyl-A, Desisoprop, Diuron, Fluometuro, Hexazinone, Imidaclopr, Metolachlo, Prometryn, Simazine, Tebuthiuro, and Terbutryn. Water temperature, salinity, light and dissolved oxygen are also determined using a Sea-Bird profiler. Each sample is identified in the water quality table by its name, latitude, longitude, sampling time and date. All sample analyses are carried out by the ACTFR laboratory, except for pesticides, which are processed at University of Queensland. The Sea-Bird profiles are treated before inclusion into the data base, and outliers are masked.\nRemote sensing: \nThe data base has an inventory of ~3000 MODIS imagery, including Aqua and Terra sensors. Because the main focus of our team research is to understand the influence of river plumes on the Great Barrier Reef, a more comprehensive temporal coverage covers the period form January to April from 2003 to 2011 (mainly MODIS Aqua imagery). The processed images were done up to level-2 and the main products extracted are CDOM as adg_443, nLw_667, bbq_555_qaa (both used as a proxy for turbidity) and chlorophyll as chl_gsm. True color images are also available for most of the images that have been processed.",

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes parts of the suburbs of Revesby\nHeights, Revesby, Panania and Picnic Point. It is an urban catchment that drains in a south-easterly\ndirection through a stormwater pipe network to the Georges River. The Morris Gully catchment is\nwholly within the southern section of Bankstown City Council (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study have been incorporated into a GIS\ndatabase. This allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved\nas required. Information in the database includes data for some 300 stormwater pits and 390\nstormwater drainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Morris Gully Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\n\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix C.\n\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk management\nprocess.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for a 1 year period between November 1989 and October 1990 inclusive. Individual measurements have been converted so that the yearly trend of wind speed and direction can be seen. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

There are two CSV files, one of higher level (Division) land use and a lower level land use (class), both with the attendant employee figures for that Survey Block. There is an additional dataset that groups all the Anzsic activities by Survey Block. The survey block number is used for linking back to the survey block shapefile.\nFkSurveyBl in the tables links to SVYBLK in the KMZ layer SurveyBlock.\nAdditional information on ANZSIC codes.",

As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 ‘stops’ and two ‘trips’. \n\nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday. The time of day is based on the mid-point of the start and arrival time of the trip. \nAM Peak: 8-9AM, PM Peak: 5-6PM",

The heaviest 18O value was recorded during MIS 12 (at a depth of 1265cm) with a value of -0.04ppt, while the lightest 18O value of -2.49ppt was registered at 1200cm depth, during MIS 11. Once the estimated ice volume effect has been accounted for, this still leaves a substantial difference 18O which must be accounted for through significant changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) or salinity. The 13C record ranges from a minimum at approximately 126k yrs BP of -0.05ppt during MIS 5, to a maximum value of 2.11ppt during MIS 10.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sector report is the employee perception survey (EPS). \r\n\r\nThe EPS captures employee views about factors affecting their workplace, such as leadership, communication, work/life balance and performance development. This information helps to understand organisational culture across the public sector and is essential in identifying areas for further consideration and acknowledging good practice. \r\n\r\nThe EPS is typically conducted in each public sector body with more than 20 employees once every five years. Different regional offices for the largest agencies, Department of Health and Department of Education, are surveyed every year. To improve the representativeness of the sample, entities are selected across a range of sizes and portfolios. However, care should be taken in interpreting the EPS results because the sample may not be entirely representative of the broader public sector.\r\n\r\nBetween March and August 2013, all employees in 17 public sector entities were asked to complete the survey (including two regional offices from the Department of Health and one from the Department of Education). The average response rate to the survey was 38%, with 5207 valid responses received.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download:\r\n\r\n1)    EPS 2013.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant employees to access online or in hardcopy\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2013 data.xls – individual responses to the EPS, with a question key and response key. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2013 data.sav – individual responses to the EPS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\nFurther information about the EPS sample and summary results for 2013 are available in the [State of the sector statistical bulletin](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/document/state-sector-statistical-bulletin-2013).\r\n",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis data set supercedes the previous Gloucester groundwater usage estimates data sets created in January 2015.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to estimate each groundwater works/bores with the volumetric entitlement and location of each groundwater bore with respective to the water source area in the Gloucester subregion. An estimation of volumetric extraction is made (in ML) based on the yield values reported in the updated data sets provided by the NSW Office of Water in March 2015. This has  been clipped to the Gloucester subregion. \n\n\n\nA spatial dataset (point shapefile GLO_Bore_extractions.shp) has been derived from this data for report map purposes.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nBore locations in the National Groundwater Information System v1.1 Sept2013 database that were spatially located within the Gloucester subregion boundary were extracted and filed in the BA_SYD/GLO project area.\n\n\n\nGroundwater works with the volumetric entitlement in the Glouster Economic Assets 26032015 database that were spatially located withing the Gloucester subregion boundary were extracted and filed in the BA_SYD/GLO project area.\n\n\n\nBased on the Yield values reported in the Glouster_Economic Assets 26032015 database, groundwater extraction volumes were estimated and filed in the BA_SYD/GLO project area.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Gloucester Groundwater Usage Estimates v20150501.

    "description": "Long-term monitoring of waterbirds in the Coorong and Lower Lakes in South Australia is undertaken by the University of Adelaide and forms part of the annual waterbird census in the Lower Lakes, Coorong and the Murray Mouth (LLCMM) region. Waterbird monitoring in the Coorong commenced in 2000, and it expanded in 2009 to include the Lower Lakes. \r\nThe LLCMM region is a Ramsar-listed wetland of international importance for migratory waterbirds. It is also one of the icon sites under The Living Murray program. The condition of the LLCMM region, and waterbird recruitment and populations, have been identified as targets against which to assess progress towards achieving the objectives of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The waterbird census data and findings form part of the ecological information used for this assessment.\r\nThe 2016-17 monitoring program was funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA). Between 2000 and 2016, the MDBA, South Australia’s Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR), Nature Foundation South Australia, Earthwatch Australia and the University of Adelaide funded the monitoring program in different years.\r\nThe MDBA has made the waterbird databases and related resources publicly available on data.gov.au as part of its commitment to the Australian Government policy on public data and information. The terms and conditions for using the data and related resources from this website can be found at https://www.data.gov.au/about.  \r\n",

    "description": "The Intellectual Property Government Open Data (IPGOD) includes over 100 years of Intellectual Property (IP) rights administered by IP Australia comprising patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder's rights. The data is highly detailed, including information on each aspect of the application process from application through to granting of IP rights. We have published a paper to accompany IPGOD which describes the data and illustrates its use, as well as a technical paper on the firm matching. Links to these papers can be found in the Readme.\r\n\r\nIPGOD 2017 was published on 26 April 2017 with exception of tables x06 which were added on 31 July 2017.\r\n\r\nIP Australia released an updated version on 27 September 2017 with some data quality improvements. Details of these improvements are listed in Data Dictionary.",

Given the focus of this project, population data was clipped by a 50km coastal buffer. \n\nNote: population data for census’ 1991 – 1996 - 2001 was purchased by NESP and is made publically available through by NESP\n\nNote: population data for 2006 and 2011 was downloaded through the ABS webportal. \nhttp://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/tablebuilder?opendocument&navpos=240\n\nNote. 2006 Census district boundaries were downloaded from the ABS website\nhttp://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2919.0.55.001Main+Features1Aug%202006?OpenDocument\nand 2011 population mesh blocks\nhttp://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1270.0.55.001\n\n\nThis data contains geographical information in shape files that represent the population density in Australia, from 1991 to 2011. The data contains the summary polygon, state_code, cd_code19, 91_pop_dat (population count), area and density (in persons per km^2). For other data sets the count will be 96_pop_dat, 2001_pop_dat, 2006_pop_dat and 2011_pop_dat.",

    "description": "The National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series were derived from the NISB\r\nHabitat Map created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the\r\nDepartment of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It\r\nsupports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the\r\navailable mapping data that show the distribution of habitats that occur between the\r\napproximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of\r\nthe outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour).\r\nThis area is broadly equivalent to the “inner” and “mid-shelf” regions identified by\r\nGeoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM\r\nNational Habitat Map Series.\r\nThe habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated\r\nhabitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as\r\ndefined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support\r\nthe development of marine ‘ecoregions’ or bioregional subregions. Details of the\r\nscheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal\r\nBenthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton,\r\n2007).\r\nThe 10 km and 50 km tiles distribution maps that form the National ECM Key Habitat\r\nDistribution Map Series were derived from the NISB Habitat Map in order to produce\r\nmaps at resolutions that are easy to interpret at state and national extents. For each state,\r\ntwo layers were produced, one with 10 km and one with 50 km tiles. In each layer, new\r\nfields were created listing the presence, absence, unknown distribution or nonapplicability\r\nof the Habitats of Interest (HOI). The HOI are rock substrate (Class 1.2),\r\nunconsolidated substrates (Class 2.0), coral habitat (classes 1.1 and 1.2.2.3), sediment\r\ndominated habitats (Class 2.0.1), seagrass dominated habitats (Classes 1.2.2.4 and\r\n2.0.2.1), mangrove dominated habitats (Class 2.0.2.2) and saltmarsh dominated habitats\r\n(Class 2.0.2.3).\r\nThere are technical geographic and cartographic issues that arise when comparing\r\nmapped data sets of multiple scales, as is the case for this compiled and derived data\r\nset. The two derived information products were generated to provide a simplified\r\nspatial representation of the broad distribution patterns of each of the key habitats\r\nNational ECM Habitat Map Series User Guide_v7.doc 30/04/2008 Page 32 of 156 \r\nacross large areas. These derived products are designed to enable the visualisation of\r\nthe habitat distributions at the regional and national extents. It is extremely important\r\nto note that they are definitely NOT able to be used to calculate areas of habitat\r\ntypes.",

    "description": "Travel Zones (TZs) are the spatial unit of geography for Transport for NSW (TfNSW). The TZ spatial layer is applied to data sources used by TfNSW for transport modelling and analysis, including the Travel Zone Projections and key transport models such as the Strategic Travel Model (STM). \nThe Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 boundaries provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) form the foundation of the Travel Zone geography. Generally, a TZ is an aggregation of whole ABS Mesh Blocks. The ASGS are based on population counts, whereas TZ boundaries are defined using population, employment, housing and transport infrastructure, with consideration for planned future changes in land use. Some of the State’s greenfield growth areas have deviated from using whole Mesh Blocks. Instead, Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) growth area precincts have been used to create more functional TZs in those areas (for example, the Aerotropolis).\nTZs are designed to have standardised trip generation levels across all zones. This causes zones to be different sizes across NSW. As with many other spatial boundaries, TZs tend to be small in areas with high land-use densities and larger in areas of lower density.\nAs areas and transport infrastructure change over time, TfNSW creates new Travel Zone geography in line with each ABS Census of Population and Housing, the latest being 2021.\nBelow you can download spatial files of the Travel Zone 2021 (TZ21) geography, the TZ21 fact sheet, as well as concordance tables for various geographies to TZ21 and vice versa.",

    "description": "WWMSP8.3 aims to address gaps in our understanding of the ecology of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Owen Anchorage and Cockburn Sound in order to improve the scientific basis for environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the proposed Westport port development. \n\n<strong>Broad-scale distribution and habitat modelling of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins</strong>\n\nThis report presents the results from analysing data collected between 2011 and 2015, focusing on the broad-scale spatial and temporal distribution of the two communities of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins’ resident in Owen Anchorage and Cockburn Sound.\n\nA total of 72 surveys were conducted in Owen Anchorage, and 73 surveys were conducted in Cockburn Sound. These surveys followed three systematic zigzag survey routes that were pre-designed in each region, spanning from June 2011 and May 2015. During these surveys, we performed photo-identification and recorded environmental variables such as water depth, sea surface temperature, and water visibility for dolphin sightings within the study area. We observed a total of 94 dolphin groups (incl. 36 foraging and 13 resting) in Owen Anchorage and 119 dolphin groups (Incl. 49 foraging and 19 resting) in Cockburn Sound, with the majority being mixed-sex groups. Additionally, calves, which are individual dolphins still dependent on their mothers, were present in most of the groups with adult dolphins.",

    "description": "This release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer using eddy covariance techniques. Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\nThe Cow Bay flux station was established in December 2008 and managed by James Cook University. The forest is classified as complex mesophyll vine forest, there are 94 species in the core 1&nbsp;Ha, and average tree height is 22&nbsp;m. Elevation of the site is 90&nbsp;m and mean annual precipitation is 3935&nbsp;mm. The Daintree Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse forests in Australia. The instruments are mounted on a walk-up tourist tower at 35&nbsp;m. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide are measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation.The early years 2009 - 12 had several data gaps. Shadowing of the radiometric equipment continues to cause artifacts on the radiometers - these can be seen as reduction in downwelling radiation with solar inclination. The site is part of the FNQ Rainforest SuperSite - associated with the Daintree node, which is part of the TERN, Australia. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are daily smokers. A current daily smoker was defined as a person who smokes one or more cigarettes, roll-your-own cigarettes, cigars or pipes at least once a day. Chewing tobacco, electronic cigarettes (and similar) and the smoking of non-tobacco products were excluded. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN102 and PHN107, should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates have a relative standard error of 25% to 50% and should be used with caution.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents indicator 16.3: Percentage of early school leavers who are unemployed 6 months on after leaving school. The data covers the years of 2009-2015 and is aggregated by Local Government Areas (LGA) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). This dataset is part of the Victorian Department of Education and Training's Victorian Child and Adolescent Monitoring System (VCAMS) data release. This dataset is sourced from the On Track Survey.\nThe VCAMS Framework comprises 150 indicators as agreed by the Children's Service Coordination Board. It incorporates 35 outcomes that relate to aspects of children's health, development, safety, learning and well-being in four categories - the child, families, community, and supports and services.\nFor more information, please visit VCAMS Indicators.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"NDP\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Final Divisions layer is the spatial representation of the recommendation of the Local Government Change Commission during the 2023 review of divided Local Government Areas. Divisional boundaries were realigned to ensure, as best as possible, that each division contains 'a reasonable proportion of electors' (the quota) at the upcoming 2024 quadrennial local government elections. Final divisional boundaries were created with input from the general public obtained through public submissions during public consultation of the review. Final divisional boundaries were created by aggregating Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygons while satisfying the requirement for divisions to have 'a reasonable proportion of electors' now, and at the 2024 elections, and taking into consideration features such as transport infrastructure, natural features, and cadastral and suburb boundaries. Final divisional boundaries were aligned to significant, named features where possible. Where practicable, the Change Commission sought to reunite previously split localities and SA1s, to create administrative and operational efficiencies in electoral roll administration. Final divisions were populated with current and projected elector counts (on 9 March 2023 and 31 March 2028 respectively), as well as percent elector deviation from the average elector count at each date. Revised divisional boundaries will come into effect upon the conclusion of the 16th of March 2024 local government elections. Current and projected elector data was obtained from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the Queensland Government Statistician s Office (QGSO) respectively.",

Modelled on the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report [In]Sight was developed in collaboration with Deloitte Access Economics and combines data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Social Health Atlas of Australia.\nBoth employment rates and the levels of labour force participation are key inputs into the creation of an efficient labour market. Generally long-term unemployment indicates the presence of inherent structural problems which may adversely impact competitiveness. Low labour force participation may reflect low education levels in the region a lack of economic opportunities or an atypical age structure (such as a skew towards retirement age persons).",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS102008.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, New South Wales, October 10, 2008\nArrived:  \tNewcastle, New South Wales, October 20, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.5ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. The travel time and warming in the two lines is very similar. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2007 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

The first leg was to map and visually survey (video) the upper continental slope (and at selected sites transects from the outer shelf to the mid-slope) at regular intervals of 1 deg latitude; the second leg was to targeted sample the surveyed locations to document the benthic biodiversity. Sediment samples were divided into two samples: an elutrition sample for macroinvertebrates that was sent to Robin Wilson at MV for analysis and a sediment sample to be analysed by Geoscience Australia.",

    "description": "Part of VMPROP, PROPERTY_VIEW_DVP is an Aspatial table. \n\nIt is created by comparing the polygons in the PROPERTY_VIEW table with the polygons in the DISPLAY_VIEW_POLYGON table. It holds a record for each PFI in the PROPERTY_VIEW table, and the DISPLAY column has a value indicating whether the polygon is Inside, Outside, or Both (partly inside and partly outside) a DISPLAY_VIEW_POLYGON polygon.\n\nThis table provides a way of limiting the display of property_view polygons so maps can be drawn efficiently.  Polygons with a DISPLAY value of I (inside) can be drawn at larger scales (eg 1:5000), while those with O (outside) can be drawn at smaller scales (eg. 1:50,000). This means rural areas can be displayed at a suitable scale, without the burden of displaying polygons in a town. A DISPLAY value of B (both) is used for some polygons, which can be drawn at both scales. These can be rivers, or multi-part polygons with parts inside and outside the DVP. \n\nTo use this flag for drawing a join is needed - property_view.pfi = property_view_dvp.property_view_pfi",

    "title": "The effects of copper antifouling paints and marinas on the ecology of marine sessile epifaunal assemblages",
    "description": "This thesis has used a field based approach to assess the effects of copper liberated from antifouling paints on sessile epifaunal (or fouling) assemblages in southeastern Australia. In the field the effects of dosed copper may be influenced by site conditions, or because the organism has developed tolerance to exposure.   To explore these possible effects experiments were conducted inside and outside of two enclosed marinas.  Marinas were located at St Kilda (Port Phillip Bay) and Hastings (Western Port Bay), Victoria. At St Kilda,  sites were located inside the St Kilda Marina and at St Kilda Pier.  At Hastings, sites were located inside Westernport Marina and at Hastings Jetty.  Additional sites were also sampled occasionally over the study period. Studies were carried out between  1997-1999.  A novel copper dosing system was developed for use in the field. \n\nStudies comparing epifaunal assemblages inside and outside the two marinas found that marinas produced different assemblages.  The marinas exerted common effects on some functional groups, but effects at the species level differed at each marina.\n \nThe effects of dosed copper inside and outside the two marinas were tested on:  i) the early recruitment of assemblages, and ii) the growth rate and competitive ability of colonial fouling organisms.  Results were characterised by high spatial and temporal variability.  Copper dose affected a number of species recruiting to the plates but was rarely found to significantly alter growth rates of the colonial organisms; this may be attributed to the high variability observed in growth rates.  The competitive ability of colonies was not found to be affected by copper dose or marinas, but few experiments examined this aspect.  \n\nReciprocal transplants of settlement plates between sites and copper doses showed that the effect of marinas on assemblages was more important than dosed copper, even though dose levels were well above background concentrations. This is probably due to a large number of factors associated with marinas over and above the effects of increased background heavy metal pollution.  Several taxa appeared to adapt to local conditions or copper dose and some appeared to show heterogeneity in response to copper dosing or an ability to acclimate to dose.  These types of findings have important implications for the manner in which we apply the findings of traditional laboratory-based ecotoxicology experiments to environmental management.",
