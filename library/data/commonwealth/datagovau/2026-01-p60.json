The Great Northern Seam in places is sufficiently thick for open cut mining but the coal is generally of very poor quality and the overburden to coal ratio much too high to warrant further drilling. Continued prospecting of the Fassifern Seam in this area is not warranted, because of the very poor quality of the coal in this seam. This report contains an account of the operations, and describes the results of the geological investigations. The results of drilling are detailed in the accompanying plates and bore logs.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the zooplankton abundance estimates of a broader sampling program carried out by the National Reference Stations (NRS) within the Integrated Marine Observing system. Regular monthly zooplankton samples are undertaken at the stations as part of a larger water sampling program by the National Reference Stations. In total nine stations are sampled regularly around the Australian coastline. Sampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo 3 monthly) off small vessels at each of the nine reference stations. The sampling is conducted using a drop net (as per the design of Heron) which has a 60 cm diameter, 100 micron mesh and is weighted to fall at 1 m/s. The net is designed to pull closed at the end of its fall so that it samples on the way down and does not sample on the way up. The depth of the sample varies at each station. 3 zooplankton samples are taken each month. 2 are fixed in formalin and will be analysed as described below. The unfixed sample is concentrated and frozen (-80oC)and will be used for molecular analysis in the future. The Port Hacking 4 (PH4) samples (2002 - Jan 2009) were sampled using a smaller net, 20 cm diameter, which sampled on the way up and down. The PH4 site is very close to the Port Hacking national reference station (PHB) where samples are now taken to build up and enhance the time series. The plankton ecology lab (based in Queensland) will analyse the samples collected for: 1. Community composition (Taxon/m3) 2. Biomass (dry weight in mg/m3) 3. Size spectrum analysis using zooscan (in progress) Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.\nAs the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

    "description": "The Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset (ACLD) brings together a 5% sample from the 2006 Census with records from the 2011 Census to create a research tool for exploring how Australian society is changing over time. In taking a longitudinal view of Australians, the ACLD may uncover new insights into the dynamics and transitions that drive social and economic change over time, conveying how these vary for diverse population groups and geographies. It is envisaged that the 2016 and successive Censuses will be added in the future, as well as administrative data sets. The ACLD is released in ABS TableBuilder and as a microdata product in the ABS Data Laboratory. \r\n\r\n The Census of Population and Housing is conducted every five years and aims to measure accurately the number of people and dwellings in Australia on Census Night. \r\n\r\n Microdata products are the most detailed information available from a Census or survey and are generally the responses to individual questions on the questionnaire. They also include derived data from answers to two or more questions and are released with the approval of the Australian Statistician.\r\nThe following microdata products are available for this longitudinal dataset: \r\n•ACLD in TableBuilder - an online tool for creating tables and graphs. \r\n•ACLD in ABS Data Laboratory (ABSDL) - for in-depth analysis using a range of statistical software packages.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Overview \r\n The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU sugar industry, EU almond industry and investment on Australia's farms. \r\n\r\nKey Issues \r\n Commodity forecasts  \r\n• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 3.3 per cent to around $58.4 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 3.8 per cent increase to $56.5 billion in 2015-16. If realised, the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 13 per cent higher than the five-year average of $51.8 billion between 2011-12 and 2015-16 in nominal terms. \r\n• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to remain largely unchanged at $29.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. \r\n• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 6.6 per cent to $29.2 billion in 2016-17. This mainly reflects forecast increases in the gross values of horticulture, cotton and oilseed production offsetting forecast decreases in the gross values of wheat and barley production. \r\n• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to fall slightly to $44 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.3 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.5 billion. \r\n• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to fall in 2016-17 are beef and veal (-12 per cent), dairy products (-1 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (-4 per cent), chickpeas (-32 per cent) and mutton (-17 per cent). Export earnings for wheat are expected to remain largely unchanged. \r\n• The forecast decreases in 2016-17 are expected to be partly offset by forecast rises in export earnings for wool (6 per cent), sugar (21 per cent), wine (1 per cent), cotton (40 per cent), lamb (3 per cent) and canola (43 per cent). \r\n• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 8 per cent to $1.7 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7 per cent in 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  \r\n\r\n In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.8 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. \r\n• Economic growth in Australia averaged 2.9 per cent in 2015-16 and is assumed to average 2.7 per cent in 2016-17. \r\n• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2016-17, largely unchanged from the estimated average for 2015-16. \r\n\r\n Articles on agricultural issues  \r\n\r\n The EU sugar industry  \r\n• The EU sugar market is highly regulated, with domestic price support, export subsidies and import restrictions. This stocktake of EU domestic and trade policies that support the EU sugar market will inform government and industry in the lead up to the commencement of Australia-EU FTA negotiations. \r\n• Australia's access to the EU sugar market is constrained by a country-specific tariff rate quota. Any improved access through either lower tariffs or increased quota would improve Australia's competitiveness in that market. \r\n\r\n The EU almond industry  \r\n• The European Union is the world's largest consumer and importer of almonds and has been a growing export market for Australian almonds since 2005-06. \r\n• However, significant benefits from an Australian-EU FTA are unlikely for Australian almonds because import tariffs are already low and equal to those faced by the United States, the main supplier to this market. \r\n\r\n Investment in Australian farms  \r\n• Investment in Australian farms is substantial, with net additions of non-land capital items on broadacre and dairy farms currently worth around $2 billion a year. \r\n• Farm operators and their spouses provide most of the capital used to fund the ownership and operation of Australian farms; corporate investors account for less than one-fifth of total capital. The strength of the family farm business structure suggests that corporate investors are unlikely to significantly displace family farmers in the near future. \r\n",

    "description": "## This dataset has been superseded. An updated version of this dataset is available from the ABARES website. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is a national compilation of catchment scale land use data for Australia (CLUM), as at March 2014. It is a seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). Catchment scale land use data was produced by combining land tenure and other types of land use information, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The date of mapping (1997 to 2012) and scale of mapping (1:25 000 to 1:250 000) vary, reflecting the source data capture date and scale. This information is provided in a supporting polygon dataset. \r\n\r\nThe CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification version 7, a three-tiered hierarchical structure. There are five primary classes, identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Primary and secondary levels relate to the principal land use. Tertiary classes may include additional information on commodity groups, specific commodities, land management practices or vegetation information. ",

    "description": "This dataset contains probability of seabed hardness data (multibeam angular backscatter response derived product) from seabed mapping surveys on the Van Diemen Rise in the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea. The survey was conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in two consecutive years 2009 (GA survey number GA-0322 and AIMS survey number SOL4934) and 2010 (GA survey number GA-0325 and AIMS survey number SOL5117). The surveys obtained detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical, geophysical) and biological data (macro-benthic and infaunal diversity, community structure) for the banks, channels and plains to investigate relationships between the physical environment and associated biota for biodiversity prediction. The surveys also provide Arafura-Timor Sea, and wider northern Australian marine region context for the benthic biodiversity of the Van Diemen Rise. Four study areas were investigated across the outer to inner shelf. Refer to the GA record 'Methodologies for seabed substrate characterisation using multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, and video data: A case study for the Eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Northern Australia' for further information on processing techniques applied (GeoCat: 74092; GA Record: 2013/11)\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R2.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart, Australia, January 10, 2013\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January 15, 2013\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This web service (WFS/WMS) contains sediment and geochemistry data for the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in the Timor Sea collected by Geoscience Australia during September and October 2012 on RV Solander (survey GA0339/SOL5650).  The detailed metadata for the individual sediment and geochemistry layers are in the following GeoCAT records: 78786, 78788, 78789, 78790, 78791, 78793, 78794, 78795, 78796, 78798 and 79005. Further information on the survey is available in the post-survey report published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L., Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A. 2013. Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (Timor Sea) Biodiversity Survey: GA0339/SOL5650 Post Survey Report. Record 2013/38. Geoscience Australia: Canberra. (GEOCAT #76658).\nSurvey SOL5650/GA0339 was undertaken between 12 September and 6 October 2012, using the AIMS 35 m research vessel Solander with a science and technical support crew from AIMS, Geoscience Australia, University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. The survey comprised a series of geophysical mapping and biophysical sampling activities in four areas within the Oceanic Shoals CMR. In each survey area, multibeam sonar data (bathymetry and backscatter) was collected to provide 100% spatial coverage, with sampling stations selected before the survey. Site selection used a spatially-balanced random stratified method (termed a Generalised Random-Tessellation Stratified [GRTS] design), that was weighted to shallow areas (<50 m water depth). Sampling included non-destructive techniques (towed underwater video, stills photography, baited underwater video) to record benthic and pelagic biota, plus physical sampling of sediments and epibenthic biota (grabs, benthic sled tows). Water column measurements (conductivity, temperature, turbidity) and sea surface samples were also taken at representative stations and during transits. To broadly characterise the sub-surface geology, shallow (<70 m) sub-surface data was collected across three of the survey areas with a sub-bottom profiler.\nSampling was undertaken at 70 stations across the four survey areas to characterise the geophysical and biological properties of the seabed and water column within each area; with sea surface samples collected at a further nine stations during transits. At each station, the type of sampling undertaken and the gear used was determined by the seabed composition, water depth and visibility. In particular, deployment of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) was limited to water depths less than ~60 m due to high turbidity and low light conditions. \nSampling activities within the four survey areas included:\nTowed underwater video transects at 52 stations to characterise seabed types and benthic communities;\nCollection of replicate sediment samples at 61 stations for sedimentology, geochemistry and infauna analyses using either a Smith-McIntyre grab (29 stations) or a box corer (32 stations);\nBenthic sled tows at 22 stations to sample epibenthos;\nDeployment of BRUVS at 56 stations to characterise demersal fish communities;\nDeployment of Stereo Imagery System for Shark and Tuna Assessments (SISSTAs) units at 120 stations to characterise pelagic fish communities;\nDeployment of a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) instrument at 63 stations to characterise water column properties, and; \nDeployment of 10 ocean drifters to map surface ocean currents in the region.\nA link to the post-survey report is available here: http://www.ga.gov.u/corporate_data/76658/Rec2013_038.pdf\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\nSurface expression GDEs are ecosystems that are dependent on the discharge of groundwater on a permanent or intermittent basis to meet all or some of their water requirements so as to maintain their communities of plants and animals, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Surface expression GDE areafeatures include wetlands and regional ecosystems that have some surface groundwater dependency. This dataset is one of five datasets that describe the distribution of known and potential GDEs across the landscape. The complete set of GDE datasets is listed below. Information about the location and extent of known and potential GDEs was sourced from expert knowledge, literature and existing datasets. 1. Surface expression GDE points 2. Surface expression GDE lines 3. Surface expression GDE areas 4. Terrestrial GDE areas 5. Subterranean GDE areas As the different types of GDEs represent different overlapping layers or cross-sections of the landscape, it is recommended that the datasets be mapped in the order of listing shown above (i.e. surface expression GDE points on top) to maintain logical consistency and assist visualisation.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThere are five datasets that describe the distribution of known and potential GDEs across the landscape: 1. Surface expression GDE points, 2. Surface expression GDE lines, 3. Surface expression GDE areas, 4. Terrestrial GDE areas, 5. Subterranean GDE areas.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nLinework to delineate the GDE extent was sourced from the following datasets (held by the Queensland Herbarium, Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts): 1. Queensland Wetland Data Wetlands Mapping (2009 extent, Version 3.0) 2. Vegetation Communities and Regional Ecosystems (REs) of Queensland (2009 extent, Version 7.0) Although the wetlands linework was typically used to represent surface expression GDEs and regional ecosystems linework typically used to represent terrestrial GDEs, this was not always the case. A notable exception is the inclusion of riverine regional ecosystems as potential terrestrial GDEs. Non-wetland regional ecosystems have been used to delineate areas that may potentially contain surface expression GDEs such as geological contact zones where springs may be not detected as a wetland in current wetlands mapping due to their small size. ATTRIBUTION The attribution for this dataset was sourced from expert knowledge, literature and existing spatial datasets. Information about the location and extent of groundwater was collected at GDE workshops held for the eastern Murray-Darling Basin and Wide Bay and Burnett mapping areas. Information collected from regional staff and other experts with local knowledge of groundwater included the location of wetlands, springs and stream baseflow. Known and potential GDEs were identified in the GDE workshops and this is attributed in the data with the level of confidence (i.e. high, moderate or low) in the knowledge about the GDE. The degree of groundwater dependency is not described. An important part of the information collection at the GDE workshops included the capture of pictorial conceptual models which are representations of observed objects, phenomena and processes in a logical and objective way with the aim of constructing a formal system whose theoretical consequences are not contrary to what is observed in the real world. These pictorial conceptual models will be hyperlinked to the GDE spatial data to aid the interpretation of the data. For more information refer to the GDE pictorial conceptual models. Another key part of the information collected was the identification of GDE decision rules that described combinations of conditions where ecosystems are or are likely to be dependent on groundwater at a specific site or local area according to expert knowledge. GDE decision rules may include descriptions of conditions such as geology, vegetation, topographic position, elevation and rainfall zones. These decision rules were subsequently categorised and combined into GDE mapping rule-sets in preparation for their application using geographic information system (GIS) technology. GDE mapping rule-set is a combination of related decision rules with similar groundwater dependent ecosystem drivers and processes that when applied to spatial data sets through GIS analysis delineate where ecosystems are or are likely to be dependent on groundwater. These GDE mapping rule-sets are used to determine the 'derived' potential GDEs that make up the majority of the GDE mapping. A full list of GDE mapping rule-sets developed for the eastern MDB and WBB regions is described below. Note that where the GDE mapping rule-sets are used, this may result in the identification of surface expression GDEs and/or terrestrial GDEs according to the local conditions and landscape drivers.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\n\"Queensland Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts\" (2013) Queensland groundwater dependent ecosystems.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of patients with specialist and obstetric costs, and out-of-pocket cost per specialist and obstetric attendance at the 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nSpecialist attendances are Medicare-subsidised referred patient/doctor encounters, such as visits, consultations, and attendances by video conference, involving medical practitioners who have been recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for Medicare benefits purposes.\n\n\nObstetric attendances are Medicare-subsidised antenatal visits and attendances for the planning and management of pregnancy, as well as obstetric procedures involving non-admitted patients. These services can be provided by an obstetrician or GP. Selected services can also be provided by a midwife, nurse or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioner when the service is provided on behalf of, and under the supervision of, a medical practitioner.\n\n\nOut-of-pocket cost per service is the net cost to the patient of a health service, after deducting the Medicare benefit paid. The measure is calculated per patient (patients' annual out-of-pocket cost for eligible attendances, divided by the number of eligible attendances that the patient claimed in the year), for patients with out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nIf a service was flagged as bulk-billed, then the fee charged was set to equal the benefit paid (so there was no out-of-pocket cost for that service).\n\n\nPatients were excluded if the sum of eligible services in the year was less than one, or if their annual out-of-pocket expenditure on the eligible services was equal to or less than zero.\n\n\nIncludes non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services only.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.

    "title": "Reef Rescue Marine Monitoring Program - Pesticide monitoring in inshore waters of the Great Barrier Reef using both time-integrated and event monitoring techniques 2005 - 2008 (RRMMP, Entox UQ)",
    "description": "The aim of this component of the Reef Rescue Monitoring Program is to assess trends in the concentrations of specific herbicides and pesticides, primarily through routine monitoring at sites (Green Island, Low Isles, Fitzroy Island, Normanby Island, Dunk Island, Orpheus Island, Magnetic Island, Cape Cleveland, Pioneer Bay, Outer Whitsunday, Sarina Inlet, North Keppel Island) within 20km of the Queensland coast. The monitoring year for routine pesticide sampling is from May to April. The year is arbitrarily divided into ¿Dry Season¿ (May to October) and ¿Wet Season¿ (November¿ April) sampling periods for reporting purposes. Within each dry season, samplers are typically deployed for two months (maximum of three monitoring periods) and within each wet season, samplers are typically deployed for one month (maximum of six monitoring periods). The maximum number of samples which should be obtained from each location within each monitoring year is nine.\r\n\r\nExposure to chemicals in the water is assessed with passive samplers. Passive samplers accumulate organic chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides from water until equilibrium is established between the concentration in water (CW ng.L-1) and the concentration in the sampler (CS ng.g-1). The concentration of the chemical in the water is estimated from calibration data obtained under controlled laboratory conditions (Booij et al., 2007). This calibration data consists of either sampling rates (RS L.day-1) for chemicals which are expected to be in the time-integrated sampling phase or sampler-water equilibrium partition coefficients (KSW L.g-1) for chemicals which are expected to be in the equilibrium sampling phase. \r\nDifferent types of organic chemicals need to be targeted using different passive sampling phases. The passive sampling techniques which are utilized in the MMP include: \r\n\r\nSDB-RPS Empore¿ Disk (ED) based passive samplers for relatively hydrophilic organic chemicals with relatively low octanol-water partition coefficients (logKOW) such as the Photosystem II (PSII) herbicides (example: diuron).\r\n\r\nPolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Semipermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) passive samplers for organic chemicals which are relatively more hydrophobic (higher log KOW) such as chlorpyrifos. \r\n\r\nThe list of target chemicals was determined based on the following criteria: pesticides detected in recent studies, those recognised as a potential risk, analytical affordability, pesticides within the current analytical capabilities of Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services (QHFSS) and those likely to be accumulated within one of the passive sampling techniques (i.e. that exist as neutral species and are not too polar).\r\n\r\nTarget Chemicals\r\nBifenthrin, \r\nFenvalerate (Pyrethroid, insecticides), \r\nBromacilb , \r\nTebuthiuron, \r\nTerbutrync,\r\nFlumeturon,\r\nAmetryn, \r\nPrometryn, \r\nAtrazine,\r\nPropazine, \r\nSimazine, \r\nHexazinone, \r\nDiuron (PSII herbicides), \r\nDesethylatrazine, \r\nDesisopropylatrazine (PSII herbicide breakdown products (also active)), \r\nOxadiazon Oxadiazolone (herbicide),\r\nChlorfenvinphos , \r\nChlorpyrifos, \r\nDiazinon, \r\nFenamiphos, \r\nProthiophos (Organophosphate insecticide), \r\nChlordane, \r\nDDT, \r\nDieldrin , \r\nEndosulphan, \r\nHeptachlor, \r\nLindane (Organochlorine insecticides), \r\nHexachlorobenzene (Organochlorine fungicide), \r\nImidacloprid (Nicotinoid insecticide), \r\nTrifluralin (Dintiroaniline), \r\nPendimethalin (Dinitroaniline herbicide), \r\nPropiconazole, \r\nTebuconazole, (Conazole fungicides)\r\nMetolachlor (Chloracetanilide herbicide)\r\nPropoxur (Carbamate insecticide)\r\n\r\nPSII herbicides (ametryn, atrazine, diuron, hexazinone, flumeturon, prometryn, simazine and tebuthiuron and atrazine transformation products desethyl- and desiso-propyl ¿ atrazine) sampled by the SDB-RPS ED samplers are also expressed as PSII herbicide equivalent concentrations (PSII-HEq) and are assessed against a PSII-HEq Index (Kennedy et al. 2010) for reporting purposes.  PSII-HEq values were derived using relative potency factors (REP) collated from relevant laboratory studies for each chemical with respect to a reference PSII herbicide diuron (Jones and Kerswell, 2003; Mueller et al. 2008; Bengston-Nash et al 2005; Schmidt, 2005; Macova et al unpublished). \r\n\r\nIf a given PSII herbicide is as potent as diuron, it will have a REP of 1. If it is more potent than diuron it will have a REP of >1, while if it is less potent than diuron it will have an REP of <1.\r\n\r\n\r\nData Location:\r\n\r\nThis dataset is saved in the eAtlas enduring data repository at: data\\RRMMP\\UQ_Mueller_Inshore-pesticides\\GBR_RRMMP_UQ_Inshore-pesticides-2011",

    "description": "The Ground Cover Disturbance Index (GCDI) is an index developed by the Biodiversity Assessment Team (BAT) within EHP, which assesses aspects of rangeland biodiversity condition. It relates the ground cover time series statistics from the State Land and Tree Study (SLATS) to the Regional Ecosystem (RE) framework. The primary data input for the index is a percentage ground cover time series, derived from SLATS Landsat TM imagery over Queensland. The GCDI analyses levels of ground cover within each RE, as different REs naturally have different ground cover percentages. Within each RE, by subregion, the mean and trend of the ground cover is calculated since 1988, with different combinations of mean and trend indicating the level of disturbance.GCDI can be calculated in areas with foliage projective cover less than 20%, ie where the satellites can see the ground cover layer through the trees. The GCDI method also requires RE mapping, and only applies in areas that are considered remnant.The GCDI model assumes that climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, etc) are consistent within a subregion. It also relates the ground cover time series statistics to the dominant ecosystem (RE1_ROOT) in the RE layer.This dataset needs to be viewed in conjunction with the low change and water bodies layers also supplied with this package.",

This dataset is based on Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) boundaries, and covers data for individual months between October 1998 and June 2020.\nLabour Force statistics are compiled from the Labour Force Survey which is conducted each month throughout Australia as part of the ABS household survey program. The Labour Force Survey provides monthly information about the labour market activity of Australia's resident civilian population aged 15 years and over. The Labour Force Survey is designed to primarily provide estimates of employment and unemployment for the whole of Australia and, secondarily, for each state and territory.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 6291.0.55.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease Note: \n\n\nThe original dataset includes data between July 1991 and October 1998, however these records are not aggregated by SA4, and therefore have been omitted from this dataset.\n\n\nAURIN has restructured and spatially enabled the original data using the 2011 SA4 Boundaries.\n\n",

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2000 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin within NSW and coastal NSW catchments.Areas of risk are based on\r\ngroundwater levels and air photo interpretation. The merged data, at a nominal\r\nscale of 1:250 000, show actual areas where dryland salinity or water-tables\r\nless than 2 metres have been measured. For the extent map, every delineated\r\narea is underpinned by either air photo data or by one or more groundwater\r\nbores. Therefore, the area at risk is regarded as conservative due to\r\nlimitations in the spatial coverage of air photo and bore data.  number of\r\ntechniques to spatially extrapolate these data to infer potential areas at\r\nrisk were trialed but were considered scientifically or statistically\r\ninadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on areas at risk having groundwater\r\nlevels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment based on groundwater less than 5\r\nm and rising was considered inappropriate. Total areas affected with\r\ngroundwater less than 5 m and rising have been presented, but only for\r\nimproved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a01.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

It combines population size and geographic remoteness to guide health workforce planning, especially in rural and remote communities. MMM is based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) and is updated after each national Census conducted by the ABS.\r\n\r\nStatistical Area Level 2 (SA2)\r\n\r\nSA2s are geographic units used in the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Built from SA1s, they are designed to represent communities with shared social and economic interactions. There are 2,473 SA2s across Australia, including special codes for populations without fixed locations. SA2s are commonly used for publishing non-Census ABS statistics such as health and population estimates, and they form the basis for SA3s and other regional structures like Significant Urban Areas and Tourism Regions.",

This aggregation not only ensures that individual schools remain\nunidentified, but also presents a summary of overall electricity usage within\nparticular geographic localities. In addition, median usage is presented\ninstead of average (mean) values to account for extreme levels of consumption\nthat can give a skewed indication of overall LGA usage.\nWhile there are figures for nearly all LGAs there are some for which no values\nare shown. This may be due to insufficient or non-available data, or to ensure\nconfidentiality of individual schools in LGAs with a small number of schools.",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information about total income distribution. The data covers the financial year of 2012-2013, and is based on Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nTotal Income is the sum of all reported income derived from Employee income, Own unincorporated business, Superannuation, Investments and Other income. Total income does not include the non-lodger population.\nGovernment pensions, benefits or allowances are excluded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) income data and do not appear in Other income or Total income. Pension recipients can fall below the income threshold that necessitates them lodging a tax return, or they may only receive tax free pensions or allowances. Hence they will be missing from the personal income tax data set. Recent estimates from the ABS Survey of Income and Housing (which records Government pensions and allowances) suggest that this component can account for between 9% to 11% of Total income.\nAll monetary values are presented as gross pre-tax dollars, as far as possible. This means they reflect income before deductions and loses, and before any taxation or levies (e.g. the Medicare levy or the temporary budget repair levy) are applied. The amounts shown are nominal, they have not been adjusted for inflation. The income presented in this release has been categorised into income types, these categories have been devised by the ABS to closely align to ABS definitions of income.\nThe statistics in this release are compiled from the Linked Employer Employee Dataset (LEED), a cross-sectional database based on administrative data from the Australian taxation system. The LEED includes more than 120 million tax records over seven consecutive years between 2011-12 and 2017-18.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAll personal income tax statistics included in LEED were provided in de-identified form with no home address or date of birth. Addresses were coded to the ASGS and date of birth was converted to an age at 30 June of the reference year prior to data provision.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, perturbation has been applied to the statistics in this release. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics, while maximising the range of information that can be released. These adjustments have a negligible impact on the underlying pattern of the statistics. Some cells have also been suppressed due to low counts.\n\n\nTotals may not align with the sum of their components due to missing or unpublished information in the underlying data and perturbation.\n\n\nFor further information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSet 'np' (not published to protect the confidentiality of individuals or businesses) values to Null.\n\n",

    "description": "The Galactic Center (GC) is a key target for the radio component of Breakthrough Listen (BL) program. Offering the largest amount of stars in any given direction in the sky, the GC is widely cited as a location believed to harbour advanced civilizations, and it is also the most energetic region in the Milky Way. We aim to conduct BL-GC Survey with Parkes radio telescope for around 350 hours. We will cover the frequency range from 700 MHz to 4 GHz, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband receiver. Our team has already leveraged both standard and bespoke tools to construct a flexible software stack to search data for signals of interest. We will look for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) by searching for both simple narrow-band signals and complex modulated signals. Along with that, as an ancillary science, we will also search for accelerated pulsars — likely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data products produced during this program will also be publically available to engage larger pulsar community",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The 30 Year Investment Opportunities Framework will guide investment in the development of Melbourne’s metropolitan open space system.\nThe Framework responds to the following issues identified in the Open Space for Everyone Strategy:\n•   There is an existing inequity of access to open space provision across the metropolitan area.\n•   The current measures used to define this inequity are quantitative only, and is based on out-of-date data. \n•   There is currently no alternative cost effective and replicable, decision-making framework that considers qualitative and quantitative spatial data and information sources. \n•   Consequently, there is also no evidence-based metropolitan wide guidance as to ‘where to invest and why’ that would help address current inequity and respond to emerging needs.\n•   Melbourne doesn’t have an integrated, metropolitan-wide investment plan that identifies regional and landscape scale gaps in the network across municipal boundaries. \nThe Framework:\nThe Framework is a planning and investment tool that will be used by State Government, Local Government and Land Managers to prioritise funding to open space projects that have the greatest impact on health and wellbeing, creating a healthier biodiversity, responding to climate change and delivering social and economic benefits.\nThe Framework aligns to the Open Space for Everyone Strategy. Decision making criteria have been developed as qualitative and quantitative measures for the four Strategy goals:\n•   Improved community health and wellbeing.\n•   Healthier biodiversity.\n•   Enhanced climate change resilience.\n•   Maximised economic and social benefits.",

Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

This work has been undertaken by researchers at University of Adelaide and University of Newcastle and used in Regional Water Strategies.\n\nThe climate for each climate variable is uploaded as a single ZIP file, which includes three files:\n<ol>\n<li>a .csv file of daily climate data of 10,000 years (format: date, data; filename starts with station ID)</li>\n<li>a pdf file of the meta data of the climate data describing the geographic location of the climate station, data type, period of observed data used for generating stochastic data, a location map.</li>\n<li>a pdf file of the quality assurance information.</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe climate variables include one or more of the following: rainfall, evapotranspiration (Mwet: Morton’s wet area potential evapotranspiration, Mlake: Morton’s lake evaporation, Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (FAO56)), Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature. \n\nNote: Among the available ZIP files listed below, you will find one large “All Stations Full Package” ZIP that contains every station’s dataset in a single complete package, as well as many smaller ZIP files, each containing the data for an individual station only.\n\nNote: Within each ZIP file, the number seen within the filename i.e.  9093_SILO_Rain.zip represents the Station ID Number 59093.",

This can result in a lower K-6 average class size than any individual year level.\n\n\nFrom 2017, school size is based on primary enrolment rather than school classification.\n\n\nData from earlier years is not replaced in the Class Size fact sheet. Schools change size. Historical data displays the data that was correct in that year.\n\n\nRefer to the individual class size factsheet publication for further information and policy context.\n\n\nData source\nEducation Statistics and Measurement Unit, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\nData quality statement\nThe Class Size Audit Data Quality Statement addresses the quality of the Class Size Audit dataset using the dimensions outlined in the NSW Department of Education's data quality management framework: institutional environment, relevance, timeliness, accuracy, coherence, interpretability and accessibility.

    "description": "This dataset provides daily measured streamflows into the four (4) major harvesting catchment dams in megalitres (ML). The streamflow is a calculated value which represents the observed 24-hour accumulated streamflow into the dam; net of any evaporation losses or rainfall gains from the dam surface. The streamflow measurement process requires reservior level, reservior gains and dam outflow data. The reservior level and dam outflow data is collected using telemetry devices. The reserviour levels are validated by Melbourne Water field operators. The dam outflow accounts for all water releases, including for consumption and for environmental purposes . The data is recorded at 8am daily. This data can be used in long and short-term catchment streamflow analysis.NOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data.

    "description": "This dataset contains the processed Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) data collected on Australia's Marine National Facility (MNF) RV Franklin and RV Southern Surveyor. XBT data typically comprises temperature and depth readings relayed to the surface at intervals of 0.1 seconds as the probe passes through the top few hundred metres of the ocean. This dataset has been QCed by the CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere's (Formerly CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research) Ocean Observing Networks (OON) group. The data can be retrieved via CMAR Data Trawler, please see link below. The data is also available via the international National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Program (GTSPP) (Franklin platform code: 09FA and call sign: VJJF, Southern Surveyor platform code: 09SS and call sign: VLHJ) and Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN).\n\nThe subset extracted for MARVL contains data on the continental shelf as defined by the 200 metre depth contour from the 2012 Bathymetric dataset merged (spatial union) with the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Australian Maritime Boundary dataset (http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_63565) available from Geosciences Australia (GA). This subset of the data contains 47 XBT station records from 15 voyages and includes temperature, pressure and salinity (derived) and spans from 1995 to the present. \n\nThe full data set is held in the O&A Information & Datacentre Data Warehouse, which currently holds over 724 XBT station records from more than 72 surveys collected since 1985.",

    "description": "Fine-scale mapping of vegetation, including Endangered Ecological\nCommunities (EECs) and Koala habitat across the Local Government Area (LGA). The mapping fulfills a fundamental requirement for the development of a Biodiversity Management Strategy (BMS) by Lismore City Council.\nThe LGA was divided into three zones, designated by colour, reflecting differing levels of available background information, potential for landuse to conflict with biodiversity objectives and other threats. NPWS Estate including National Parks (NPs), Nature Reserves (NRs) and State Conservation Areas (SCAs) as well as State Forests (SFs) were outside the scope of the mapping project.\nOriginal field work was undertaken between November 2010 and June 2011.  The mapping project commenced in Nov 2017 using 2009 aerial photography along with Sept 2012 imagery limited to the rural villages of Modanville, Dunoon and Nimbin. From May 2018 onwards the project used high resolution aerial photography taken in April 2018.\nVegetation was classified by API mainly on the basis of spatial patterns, texture and colour calibrated by field observations. Non-plantation vegetation polygons were assigned to vegetation units on the basis of canopy dominant species. Vegetation communities were placed in Keith formations and classes. Vegetation condition was also recorded.\nEach vegetation polygon was assigned to a Koala habitat category based only on flora species present.\nA list of EECs reported or considered likely to occur in the LGA were also derived.\nA reliability code was allocated to each mapped polygon, according to the source of the data and/or the manner in which data was collected.\nVIS_ID 4479",

    "description": "The purpose of this experiment was to quantitatively examine the rapid colour changes associated with the fiddler crab, Uca capricornis. Experiments were conducted in the East Point Reserve, Darwin from Nov - Jan (04/05 and 05/06). \n\n65 randomly selected crabs were caught (21 males and 44 females) and their ability to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer. \n\nThe results indicate that when caught, or otherwise stressed, U. capricornis are capable of rapidly changing their colour, with short term colour changes more likely in females. In all cases the pattern remained unchanged, but did become more difficult to distinguish as the colours darkened.",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated values of Income Distribution as a category of the estimates of Personal Income for Small Areas ABS release. The data spans over the financial years of 2010-11 and is aggregated to the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) boundaries.\nThis release presents regional data on the number of income earners, amounts they receive, and the distribution of income for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 financial years. An improved geocoding process has been introduced for this release. As such, previously released estimates for the 2010-11 and 2012-13 financial year have been superseded. The following personal income categories are provided in this census release:\n\n\nEmployee Income\n\n\nOwn Unincorporated Business Income\n\n\nInvestment Income\n\n\nSuperannuation Income\n\n\nOther Income (Income not allocatable to any other categories)\n\n\nTotal Income (Sum of previous categories)\nThese statistics provide insights into the nature of regional economies and the economic well-being of the people who live there. The data has been sourced from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and is presented with the updated 2016 editions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGS):  Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2); Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3); Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4); Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) and Local Government Area (LGA).\n\n\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note:\n\n\nWhen interpreting these results, it should be noted that some low income earners, for example those receiving Government pensions and allowances, or those who earned below the tax free threshold, may not be present in the data, as they may not be required to lodge personal tax forms. Other individuals may not lodge a tax return even if required, therefore care should be taken in interpreting the data as well as comparing the data in this publication with other income data produced by the ABS.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, a confidentialisation process called perturbation has been applied to the data. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics while maximising the range of information that can be released.\n\n\nWhere data is not available or not for publication, the record has been set to a null value.\n\n",

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

    "title": "ABS - Personal Income - Total Income Distribution (SA2) 2011-2012",
    "description": "This dataset presents information about total income distribution. The data covers the financial year of 2011-2012, and is based on Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nTotal Income is the sum of all reported income derived from Employee income, Own unincorporated business, Superannuation, Investments and Other income. Total income does not include the non-lodger population.\nGovernment pensions, benefits or allowances are excluded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) income data and do not appear in Other income or Total income. Pension recipients can fall below the income threshold that necessitates them lodging a tax return, or they may only receive tax free pensions or allowances. Hence they will be missing from the personal income tax data set. Recent estimates from the ABS Survey of Income and Housing (which records Government pensions and allowances) suggest that this component can account for between 9% to 11% of Total income.\nAll monetary values are presented as gross pre-tax dollars, as far as possible. This means they reflect income before deductions and loses, and before any taxation or levies (e.g. the Medicare levy or the temporary budget repair levy) are applied. The amounts shown are nominal, they have not been adjusted for inflation. The income presented in this release has been categorised into income types, these categories have been devised by the ABS to closely align to ABS definitions of income.\nThe statistics in this release are compiled from the Linked Employer Employee Dataset (LEED), a cross-sectional database based on administrative data from the Australian taxation system. The LEED includes more than 120 million tax records over seven consecutive years between 2011-12 and 2017-18.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAll personal income tax statistics included in LEED were provided in de-identified form with no home address or date of birth. Addresses were coded to the ASGS and date of birth was converted to an age at 30 June of the reference year prior to data provision.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, perturbation has been applied to the statistics in this release. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics, while maximising the range of information that can be released. These adjustments have a negligible impact on the underlying pattern of the statistics. Some cells have also been suppressed due to low counts.\n\n\nTotals may not align with the sum of their components due to missing or unpublished information in the underlying data and perturbation.\n\n\nFor further information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSet 'np' (not published to protect the confidentiality of individuals or businesses) values to Null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Katherine for 2019. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Resident Population (ERP) by number of households and number of dwellings for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for Local Government Areas (LGA) and VIFSAs for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset in the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nsmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them\n\n\nlarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level\n\n\nas far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n\nThe data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.\n\n",

For a consistent national dataset, the Geoscience Australia 1:100,000 Coastline and State borders dataset was used in conjunction with the internal NRM region boundaries provided by the States.\n\nPlease note, from time to time States/Territories revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local legislation. It is envisaged that the boundaries will not change dramatically from those agreed under the bilateral agreements between the States/Territory and the Commonwealth however minor alterations will occur. The dataset is regularly updated to reflect these changes.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and attended 5 or more antenatal visits, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWomen who gave birth at 32 weeks or more gestation to a livebirth or a stillbirth, with known number of antenatal visits (includes women with no antenatal care).\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "title": "National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) Version 5.1 - AUSTRALIA - Estimated Pre-1750 Vegetation",
    "description": "CAUTION: NVIS datasets are large and computationally intensive! Please allow sufficient time to plan and execute any geoprocessing of NVIS datasets.\n\nThis dataset is a vector layer delineating the Pre-1750 ('pre-clearing', 'pre-European') native vegetation types across Australia made available for release under CC BY. This dataset is part of a larger compilation of Australian states and territories (with the exception of most of NSW and TAS which do not have pre-1750 data for this version) for the latest release (Version 5.1) of the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS). Each state/territory is available for separate download, due to size limitations.\n\nThis dataset comprises part of NVIS Version 5.0. This dataset was also used to develop previous Major Vegetation Groups and Subgroup products (version 3.0 to present). Note that the interpretation of vegetation descriptions (i.e. in the lookup table) may differ between versions. \n\nThe comparable estimated extant ('present') vegetation are in the following separate dataset(s):\nNVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_\n\nFeature classes are named - NVIS5_1_AUST_EXT_ or NVIS5_1_AUST_PRE_ .\n\nTo use this dataset and display the Level 1-6 hierarchy  the field \"NVISDSC1\" must be joined to the field \"NVIS_ID\" in the lookup table, available for separate:\nNVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_DETAILn > where n is an integer incremented with minor updates - see metadata for this table for instructions.\n\nOnce this table has been joined, a simple display option is to use the field \"MVG_NAME\" which includes the names of the NVIS Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs) as described at: http://www.environment.gov.au/land/publications/factsheets-vegetation-profiles-major-vegetation-groups. The most detailed account of the pre-clearing vegetation is in the field L6_SUB_ASSOCIATION following the NVIS scheme.\n[A legend or 'shadesets' for the MVGs and MVSs can be found \n\nFor internal users - N:\\Veg\\NVIS_V5_1_\\MVG_MVS\\Symbology\\Vector\n\nFor external users - in this package: \n- MVG5_1_BY_NAME.lyr\n- MVG5_1_BY_NUMBER.lyr\n- MVS5_1_BY_NAME.lyr\n- MVS5_1_BY_NUMBER.lyr\nUse the field “MVG_NUMBER/MVS_NUMBER” or “MVG_NAME/MVS_NAME” for the symbology.]\n\nThe NVIS vegetation attributes contain information on vegetation structure (growth form, height and cover) and floristics (genus and species) as documented in the Australian Native Vegetation Assessment (NLWRA, 2001) and the Australian Vegetation Attribute Manual Version 7.0 (NVIS Technical Working Group, 2017). Levels 1 to 6 of the NVIS Information Hierarchy are present in this dataset, where provided by the custodian.\n\nAttribute data for the above datasets marked \"Level 6\" were supplied in the XML Transfer System, which checks for consistency throughout the NVIS Information Hierarchy (NVIS Technical Working Group, 2017). Attribute data was loaded into an Oracle database at ERIN, where each vegetation type in the source data was allocated a unique NVIS identifier (NVIS_ID). Some attribute data, principally that coming from the Native Vegetation Mapping Program (NVMP), met the standard NVIS quality assurance tests.\n\nThe spatial data were supplied with SOURCE_CODEs, which were converted to NVIS identifiers (NVISDSC1-6). Please note that vegetation mapping can be quite complex and a single polygon may contain a \"mosaic\" of up to six vegetation associations. Other NVIS attributes were also updated on the basis of the supplied data.\n\nFor this update, Version 5.1, the extant dataset for Tasmania has been updated, with gapfilling work being completed for the NSW extant dataset. Some of the rulesets underpinning the assignment of MVGs and MVSs have also been updated to improve consistency for their allocation. Version 5.0 substantially standardised the lookup tables (NVIS5_1_LUT_DETAILxxxx and NVIS5_1_LUT_AUST_FLATxxxx). For more detail refer to the associate lookup tables. Previously, Version 4.2 updated NSW. For version 4.1 most agencies supplied data to the update.\n\nThis dataset is not comparable with earlier versions of NVIS, such as the 2001 Native Vegetation Assessment (which used a different structure and vegetation typology).\n\nReference:\nNVIS Technical Working Group (2017) Australian Vegetation Attribute Manual: National Vegetation Information System, Version 7.0.
