    "title": "AIHW - Maternity Indicators - Episiotomy for Women having First Birth for Instrumental Vaginal Births (%) (SA3) 2014-2016",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who had an episiotomy when giving birth for the first time and giving birth vaginally and instrumentally, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their first baby who had an episiotomy during an instrumental vaginal birth, divided by the number of females having their first baby who gave birth vaginally and had an instrumental vaginal birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth for the first time and had a vaginal birth, with or without instruments. Females who had a multiple birth are included if this was the first time they had given birth.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who did not give birth for the first time or gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nInstrumental vaginal birth means that the baby was delivered with the use of forceps or vacuum extraction.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, a combined laceration and episiotomy value could be recorded; from 2014 onwards, episiotomy could be recorded separately.\n\n\nData were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Daily accumulated electricity supply (kWh) and daily accumulated electricity generation (kWh) into the Eastern Treatment Plant (ETP) of Melbourne Water. This data is collected using revenue quality meters across each supply line (feeder) into the plant, and Melbourne Water owned power meters for generation measurements. Melbourne Water collects and stores this feeder data as 15 minute interval data, and the generation data at real time. The data in this file summarises the electricity consumption and generation as daily usage. The time period associated with each day has been converted to a UTC time zone. This data set allows year on year comparison or daily usage against atmospheric changes i.e. temperature variance, rainfall. Feeder 1 and Feeder 2 can be combined to obtain the total Grid Electricity Consumption for ETP, and combined with the total electricity Generation to obtain the total Electricity consumption for ETP.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) route segments for the year of 2021. Route segments are a public transport link between two adjacent activity nodes or other network nodes. A numbered public transport route is usually made up of a sequence of consecutive route segments\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity) \n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility. \nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Activity Nodes (Point) 2021\" or \"SNAMUTS - Indicators by Areas (SA1) 2021\". Some routes are composed of disjoint line segments and as such the data should be used for visualisation purposes only.\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website. A full list of SNAMUTS publications can be found at http://www.snamuts.com/publications.html.",

    "description": "It is the responsibility of the fire control authority to assign low or high fire ratings to areas of land under Part 8 Section 80 of the Electricity Safety Act 1998. These ratings are used in conjunction with the Electricity Safety (Electric Line Clearance) Regulations 2020, the Electricity Safety (Installations) Regulations 2019 and the Electricity Safety (Bushfire Mitigation) Regulations 2013, to prescribe low or high bushfire risk areas.\nThis dataset defines areas of low fire hazard rating. Areas that are not covered by this layer are rated as having a high fire hazard rating for the purposes of the Electricity Safety Act 1998.\nCouncils that fall entirely within the former Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB) area have been rated as low fire hazard.  In the data layer we refer to these councils as \"undefined\".\nLow fire hazard rating areas are usually restricted to irrigated areas and towns where block sizes are small and well maintained. Examples of these are as follows: high density residential areas (i.e. property sizes of up to 0.25ha); industrial and commercial urban areas; high moisture crops (i.e. market gardens); irrigated farmland (but not seasonally irrigated as it must remain irrigated over summer); vineyards; golf courses and sporting ovals (permanently green).\nHigh fire hazard rating areas are defined as any areas not covered by the low hazard rating areas. These areas are said to contain sufficient fuel on the ground to carry a fire. \nHazardous bushfire risk area (HBRA) as defined by the Act, means an area assigned a fire hazard rating of ‘high’.  Low bushfire risk area (LBRA) deemed to mean areas assigned a fire hazard rating of ‘low’.\nFurther detailed information about the Electric Line Vegetation Clearance Project, please visit the following site: \nhttps://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/plan-prepare/building-planning-regulations/electric-line-vegetation-clearance",

    "description": "This data was collected in May and June 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022009 Leg 2.\n\nDeparted:  Nuku'Alofa, Tonga, May 28, 2009\nArrived: \tLautoka Fiji, June 25, 2009\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The West Australian Mooring Sub-Facility is part of the Australian National Mooring Network. \n\nThe Western Australia moorings sub-facility is responsible for a collection of moorings designed to monitor variability in the Leeuwin Current and continental shelf currents both in terms of along-shore and cross-shore variability. Moorings in the region also monitor processes within the Perth Canyon. The time-series monitoring of physical and biological parameters provided by these moorings supplements past and current research activities in the region based at the CSIRO, the Department of Fisheries WA and Western Australian Universities. The sub-facility currently maintains six regional moorings (two recently decommissioned) and two National Reference Stations (one recently retrieved and not redeployed).\n \nThe regional moorings are located off Perth, clustered near the Perth Canyon and the Two Rocks Line. The Two Rocks Line contains four moorings which transect the continental shelf north of Perth from the 44m to the 500m isobath (the 50m mooring was decommissioned in May 2013, and the 150m mooring in October 2013). Around the Perth Canyon, there remains one shelf mooring in shallower water at the head of the canyon, formerly two slope moorings were located near the 500m isobath (decommissioned in July 2010 and March 2014), to monitor processes in and around the canyon. Primarily these moorings are thermistor strings allowing the structure of the Leeuwin Current to be determined. Two of the moorings also sample biogeochemical parameters.",

    "description": "Bush Fire Prone Land is mapped within a local government area, which becomes the trigger for planning for bush fire protection. Bush Fire Prone Land mapping is intended to designate areas of the State that are considered to be higher bush fire risk for development control purposes. Not being designated bush fire prone is not a guarantee that losses from bush fires will not occur.The NSW Bush Fire Prone Land dataset is a map prepared in accordance with the Guide for Bush Fire Prone Land Mapping (BFPL Mapping Guide) and certified by the Commissioner of NSW RFS under purposes of Section 10.3 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 No 203.\n\nOver time there has been various releases of the BFPL Mapping Guide, in which the categories and types of vegetation included in the BFPL map have changed. The version of the guide under which, each polygon or LGA was certified is contained in the data. An area of land that can support a bush fire or is likely to be subject to bush fire attack, as designated on a bush fire prone land map.\n\nThe definition of bush fire vegetation categories under guideline version 5b: * Vegetation Category 1 consists of: &gt; Areas of forest, woodlands, heaths (tall and short), forested wetlands and timber plantations. <i>HEX code: #FF0000</i>* Vegetation Category 2 consists of: &gt;Rainforests. &gt;Lower risk vegetation parcels. These vegetation parcels represent a lower bush fire risk to surrounding development and consist of: - Remnant vegetation; - Land with ongoing land management practices that actively reduces bush fire risk. <i>HEX code: #</i><i>FFD200</i>* Vegetation Category 3 consists of: &gt; Grasslands, freshwater wetlands, semi-arid woodlands, alpine complex and arid shrublands. <i>HEX code: #</i><i>FF8000</i>* Buffers are created based on the bushfire vegetation, with buffering distance being 100 metres for vegetation category 1 and 30 metres for vegetation category 2 and 3. <i>HEX code: #</i><i>FFFF73</i>\n\nVegetation excluded from the bushfire vegetation categories include isolated areas of vegetation less than one hectare, managed lands and some agricultural lands. Please refer to BFPL Mapping Guide for a full list of exclusions.\n\nThe legislative context of this dataset is as follows: On 1 August 2002, the Rural Fires and Environmental Assessment Legislation Amendment Act 2002 (Amendment Act) came into effect. The Act amended both the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and the Rural Fire Services Act 1997 to ensure that people, property and the environment are more fully protected against the dangers that may arise from bushfires. Councils are required to map bushfire prone land within their local government area, which becomes the trigger for the consideration of bushfire protection measures when developing land. BFPL Mapping Guidelines are available from www.rfs.nsw.gov.au\n\n<a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/4412/Guideline-for-Councils-to-Bushfire-Prone-Area-Land-Mapping.pdf\">http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/4412/Guideline-for-Councils-to-Bushfire-Prone-Area-Land-Mapping.pdf</a>",

    "description": "The Victorian Land Use Information System (VLUIS) 2016/17 dataset has been created by the Spatial Information Sciences Group of the Agriculture Victoria Research in the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport, and Resources. It covers the entire landmass of Victoria and separately describes the land tenure, land use and land cover across the state at the cadastral parcel level.\n\nThe methodology for creating the VLUIS is described in Morse-McNabb et al. (2015) with the following notable changes:\n1. Land use data provided by the Office of the Valuer-General of Victoria for the 2014 year has been used as a base input. Readily available sources of land use information from government and industry have been used to provide updates to the land tenure and land use components of the 2016/17 dataset. The source dataset and source date are recorded for each parcel. The land cover mapping method remains unchanged to previous versions of the VLUIS.\n2. The Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification, version 8, has been added to the attribute table. The VLUIS land use code fields have been translated across to the ALUM classification. Version 8 has been used you can find the ALUM Classification on the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources ABARES ALUM page: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification. \n3. Land parcels within urban areas, mapped in previous versions, have been masked out and have been renamed as Built Up Areas vastly reducing the size of the 2016/17 dataset. Land cover for Built Up Areas (LC_CODE = BUILT) is listed as null.\n4. Road reserves and road parcels have been merged together and renamed Voids. Land cover for Voids (LC_CODE = VOID) is listed as null.\n5. Parcels &lt;12.5 hectares: land cover has not been attributed as the resolution of MODIS cannot support classifications of polygons smaller than 12.5 hectares.\n\nThe data is in the form of an ESRI feature class. \n\nTo use the VLUIS data correctly it is important to understand the difference between the three components of VLUIS. The Guidelines for land use mapping in Australia: principles, procedures and definitions, Edition 3 published in 2006 by the Commonwealth of Australia, defines them as follows: \nLand tenure is the form of an interest in land. Some forms of tenure (such as pastoral leases or nature conservation reserves) relate directly to land use and land management practice. \nLand use means the purpose to which the land cover is committed. Some land uses, such as agriculture, have a characteristic land cover pattern. These usually appear in land cover classifications. Other land uses, such as nature conservation, are not readily discriminated by a characteristic land cover pattern. For example, where the land cover is woodland, land use may be timber production or nature conservation. \nLand cover refers to the physical surface of the earth, including various combinations of vegetation types, soils, exposed rocks and water bodies as well as anthropogenic elements, such as agriculture and built environments. Land cover classes can usually be discriminated by characteristic patterns using remote sensing.\n\nA metadata statement, for the VLUIS product, and ESRI symbology files for the data can be freely downloaded from the VLUIS project page on the Victorian Resources Online website: http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/vluis\n\nDOI 10.26279/5b96043f7bd02",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The Sydney Harbour catchment area includes a number of different river systems which drain into the Port Jackson estuary. During high rainfall events the catchment areas behave differently to deliver contaminants into the Port Jackson estuary. Under conditions of high rainfall contaminants are delivered to areas very quickly as freshwater slides over the top of the denser more saline waters of the estuary. Secchi Disc samples were taken along the Port Jackson estuary over four days to determine the behaviour of the freshwater plume as it travels in a layer of freshwater to be flushed or flocculate out at some point in the estuary.",

    "title": "Household Travel Survey",
    "description": "Household Travel Survey (HTS) is the most comprehensive source of personal travel data for the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area (GMA). This data explores average weekday travel patterns for residents in Sydney GMA.\nThe Household Travel Survey (HTS) collects information on personal travel behaviour. The study area for the survey is the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area (GMA) which includes Sydney Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA), parts of Illawarra and Hunter regions. All residents of occupied private dwellings within the Sydney GMA are considered within scope of the survey and are randomly selected to participate.\nThe HTS has been running continuously since 1997/981 and collects data for all days through the year – including during school and public holidays.\nTypically, approximately 2,000-3,000 households participate in the survey annually. Data is collected on all trips made over a 24-hour period by all members of the participating households.\nAnnual estimates from the HTS are usually produced on a rolling basis using multiple years of pooled data for each reporting year2. All estimates are weighted to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Estimated Resident Population, corresponding to the year of collection3. Unless otherwise stated, all reported estimates are for an average weekday.\nDue to disruptions in data collection resulting from the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, post-COVID releases of HTS data are based on a lower sample size than previous HTS releases. To ensure integrity of the results and mitigate risk of sampling errors some post-COVID results have been reported differently to previous years. Please see below for more information on changes to HTS post-COVID (2020/21 onwards).\n\n\nData collection for the HTS was suspended during lock-down periods announced by the NSW Government due to COVID-19.\n\n\nExceptions apply to the estimates for 2020/21 which are based on a single year of sample as it was decided not to pool the sample with data collected pre-COVID-19.  \n\n\nHTS population estimates are also slightly lower than those reported in the ABS census as the survey excludes overseas visitors and those in non-private dwellings.\n\n\nChanges to HTS post-COVID (2020/21 onwards)\nHTS was suspended from late March 2020 to early October 2020 due to the impact and restrictions of COVID-19, and again from July 2021 to October 2021 following the Delta wave of COVID-19. Consequently, both the 2020/21 and 2021/22 releases are based on a reduced data collection period and smaller samples.\nDue to the impact of changed travel behaviours resulting from COVID-19 breaking previous trends, HTS releases since 2020/21 have been separated from pre-COVID-19 samples when pooled. As a result, HTS 2020/21 was based on a single wave of data collection which limited the breadth of geography available for release. Subsequent releases are based on pooled post-COVID samples to expand the geographies included with reliable estimates.\nDisruption to the data collection during, and post-COVID has led to some adjustments being made to the HTS estimates released post-COVID:\nSA3 level data has not been released for 2020/21 and 2021/22 due to low sample collection.\nLGA level data for 2021/22 has been released for selected LGAs when robust Relative Standard Error (RSE) for total trips are achieved\nMode categories for all geographies are aggregated differently to the pre-COVID categories\nPurpose categories for some geographies are aggregated differently across 2020/21 and 2021/22.\nA new data release – for six cities as defined by the Greater Sydney Commission - is included since 2021/22.\nPlease refer to the Data Document for 2022/23 (PDF, 262.54 KB) for further details.\nRELEASE NOTE\nThe latest release of HTS data is 15 May 2025.  This release includes Region, LGA, SA3 and Six Cities data for 2023/24. Please see 2023/24 Data Document for details.\nA revised dataset for LGAs and Six Cities for HTS 2022/23 data has also been included in this release on 15 May 2025. If you have downloaded HTS 2022/23 data by LGA and/or Six Cities from this link prior to 15/05/2025, we advise you replace it with the revised tables. If you have been supplied bespoke data tables for 2022/23 LGAs and/or Six Cities, please request updated tables.\nRevisions to HTS data may be made on previously published data as new sample data is appended to improve reliability of results. Please check this page for release dates to ensure you are using the most current version or create a subscription (https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/subscriptions) to be notified of revisions and future releases.",

    "description": "This data was collected in October 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS052009.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, Australia, October 16, 2009\nArrived:  \tSydney, Australia, October 26, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

    "description": "The Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD) contains information detailing presentations at Victorian public hospitals with designated Emergency Departments. For the purposes of this report, patients presenting for family violence reasons are identified by the ‘human intent’ data item. \nAt the Emergency Department, the clinician assesses the most likely human intent. Patients presenting for family violence reasons are those that presented with a human intent injury of 'Maltreatment, assault by domestic partner' or 'Child neglect/maltreatment by parent or guardian'. The VEMD information published under the Family Violence Database (FVDB) focuses on the demographic characteristics as well as the nature and cause of their injuries of the patients presenting for family violence reasons. The FVDB only reports on family violence (FV) related patients (as indicated by the human intent data item). Therefore, when there is a reference in the FVDB to 'patients', this only includes family violence related patients presenting to a public hospital in Victoria.\nThe counting unit for the VEMD is the patient presenting at a Victorian public hospital. In the dataset there is one record per patient. However, persons can present multiple times at the emergency department and thus have multiple records in the VEMD.",

    "description": "The 2014 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, health and wellbeing, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 12 May to 15 June 2014. Overall, 99,392 employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 68%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download. \r\n\r\n* 2014 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2014 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2014 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2014 employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n \r\n* 2014 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2014 employee census for use with the SPSS software package.\r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2014 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2014 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

Insufficient physical activity is defined as those aged 18-64 years who did not complete over 150 minutes of physical activity, and at least 5 sessions over a week, and those aged 65+ years who did not complete 30 minutes of activity on at least 5 days in a week. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion.

Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures.

    "description": "This data was collected in January - February 2013 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213V3.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, January 13, 2013\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  February 22, 2013\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",

    "description": "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is  the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012,  charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. Each financial year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. \r\n\r\nGenerally, charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period – for example, by 31 December for a charity with a 30 June financial year end. \r\n\r\nThis dataset provides a record of the 2013 AISs submitted by charities, that is, the statements submitted for the 2013 reporting period. For most charities that will be for the financial year 1 July 2012 – 30 June 2013, for others it will be the 2013 calendar year. There are also a small number of charities that will have alternative particular reporting periods. \r\n\r\nFor the 2013 financial year (being the first period for reporting to the ACNC), the Commissioner exercised her discretion to extend the due date for lodgement to 31 March 2014. As at August 2014, approximately 42 000 registered charities have filed their 2013 AIS with the ACNC. The dataset is updated fortnightly.\r\n\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the [ACNC Register](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity). There are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information, including because the information:\r\n\r\n-\tis commercially sensitive and it could cause harm\r\n-\tis false, confusing or misleading\r\n-\tis offensive\r\n-\tcould endanger public safety\r\n-\tfalls within the circumstances allowed by the regulations (such as if the information identifies a private donor in relation to a private ancillary fund).\r\n\r\nSome charities have asked for their details to be withheld. If their withholding request is pending or has been approved, the AIS data relating to these charities has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nThe AIS information for individual charities can be viewed at [www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity](www.acnc.gov.au/findacharity).\r\n\r\nThe 2013 AIS dataset on data.gov.au can be used to find the AIS information lodged by more than one charity, for example for research purposes. It can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all the AIS information that the ACNC has received for the 2013 reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 AIS will ask further questions, particularly in relation to financial information for medium and large charities. The dataset of 2014 Annual Information Statements will be uploaded to data.gov.au in due course.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datatsets on data.gov.au, as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation. Please click [here](http://www.data.gov.au/dataset?q=acnc) to view these. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of closed treatment episodes for clients who seek treatment for their own drug use by principal drug of concern. A treatment episode is the period of contact between a client and a treatment provider where there are defined start (commencement) and end (cessation) dates. It is considered closed where any of the following occurs: treatment is completed or has ceased; there has been no contact between the client and treatment provider for 3 months; or there is a change in the main treatment type, principal drug of concern or delivery setting.\nThe alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the closed treatment episode was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment episodes are excluded from the AODTS NMDS if they: are not closed in the relevant financial year; are for clients who are receiving pharmacotherapy and not receiving any other form of treatment that falls within the scope of the collection; include only activities relating to needle and syringe exchange; or are for a client aged under 10 years.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer incidence statistics in Australia for all cancers combined and the 6 top cancer groupings (colorectal, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma of the skin and pancreas) and their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2006-2010 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nIncidence data refer to the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in a given time period. It does not refer to the number of people newly diagnosed (because one person can be diagnosed with more than one cancer in a year). Cancer incidence data come from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012 Australian Cancer Database (ACD).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - Cancer Incidence and Mortality Across Regions (CIMAR) books.\n\n\nAustralian Cancer Database 2012 Data Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nDue to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nThe Australian and jurisdictional totals include people who could not be assigned a SA4. The number of people who could not be assigned a SA4 is less than 1% of the total.\n\n\nThe Australian total also includes residents of Other Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory).\n\n\nThe ACD records all primary cancers except for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (BCCs and SCCs). These cancers are not notifiable diseases and are not collected by the state and territory cancer registries.\n\n\nThe diseases coded to ICD-10 codes D45-D46, D47.1 and D47.3-D47.5, which cover most of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative cancers, were not considered cancer at the time the ICD-10 was first published and were not routinely registered by all Australian cancer registries. The ACD contains all cases of these cancers which were diagnosed from 1982 onwards and which have been registered but the collection is not considered complete until 2003 onwards.\n\n\nNote that the incidence data presented are for 2006-2010 because 2011 and 2012 data for NSW and ACT were not able to be provided for the 2012 ACD.\n\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data.

Average annual family income is\r\ncalculated as the family share of farm income plus any wages (that are\r\nincluded as farm costs for taxation assessment) paid to the owner manager,\r\nspouse and dependant children, plus all off-farm income of owner manager and\r\nspouse. The data is reported at the Statistical Division (SD) level for\r\nAustralia. This data relates to broadacre and dairy farms run by owner\r\nmanagers and has been collected by annual farm survey interview and is\r\nsupplemented by information in the farm accounts. The data is presented at a\r\nscale of 25000000. The following attributes are contained within the dataset;\r\nSd code a a unique 3 digit code for Statistical Divisions (SD), Sd name a the\r\nname of the Statistical Division (SD), Faminc a the average annual farm family\r\nincome for the period 1996-1997 to 1998-1999.

    "description": "This data was collected in July and August 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage ST022009.\n\nDeparted: \tNoumea, New Caledonia, July 29, 2009\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, August 6, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "A deep crustal seismic reflection survey, conducted at Gundary Plains near Canberra, to test a digital seismic recording system, produced additional data for interpretation of seismic refraction profiles in the Lachlan Fold Best. Good reflections were recorded down to the probable Moho, at an estimated depth of 41 km. The intracrustal reflections are characterised by bands of seismic energy, which probably represent velocity transition zones within the crust.",

Its position is determined by the methodology used to input into the Topographic Database. Common methods of input include GPS, traced from the cadastre or traced from an orthorectified image.Data included in Road Segments includes:Vehicular TrackPathwayContinuity LineStandard Road&nbsp;On-off RampDual CarriagewayInitial Publication Date01/05/2024Data Currency01/05/2024Data Update FrequencyOtherContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeScene Layer Package (*.slpk)AttributionData Theme, Classification or Relationship to other DatasetsTransport Theme of the NSW Foundation Spatial Data FrameworkAccuracyThe dataset maintains a positional relationship to, and alignment with, the Lot and Property digital datasets. The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal. The features vertical accuracy is also a function of its horizon.Spatial Reference System (dataset)WGS84Spatial Reference System (web service)EPSG:4326WGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentContent LineageData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonStandard and SpecificationData CustodianSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesPoint of ContactSS-SDS@customerservice.nsw.gov.auData AggregatorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesData DistributorSpatial Services | Department of Customer ServicesAdditional Supporting InformationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for the consumption by common GIS platforms.

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "This data was collected in April 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_C01.\n\nDeparted: \tSydney, NSW, Apr 05, 2011\nArrived:   \t   Hobart, TAS, Apr 14, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan for the Mudgee Local Creeks has been prepared\nas part of a Government program to mitigate the impacts of major floods and reduce the hazards in\nthe floodplain. Figure 1.1 shows the study area which comprises the urban part of town on the\nsouthern bank of the Cudgegong River. This area is drained by seven creeks in addition to Redbank\nCreek, which was included in the Mudgee Floodplain Management Study and Plan (Bewsher\nConsulting, 2002). That study dealt with mainstream flooding from the Cudgegong River which also\ninfluences flooding near the junctions with the creeks.\n\nThe seven creeks investigated in the present study comprise Catchments A to F and Sawpit Gully.\n\nThe Brief for the study issued by Council generally follows the scope of work required for a Floodplain\nRisk Management Study as identified in the Floodplain Development Manual (FDM, 2005). The NSW\nGovernment’s Flood Prone Land Policy and the FDM, 2005 form the basis of floodplain management\nin the State. Figure 1.2 shows the steps involved in the floodplain management planning process.\n\nThis report is <strong>Volume 1</strong> of the overall investigation and sets out the findings of the Floodplain Risk\nManagement Study and contains the draft Plan. The results of the updated flood investigations of the\nvarious creeks are presented in <strong>Volume 2</strong>.\n\n<strong>Section 2</strong> of the Study contains information on baseline flooding conditions on the floodplains,\nincluding a review of existing planning policies, assessment of the impacts of flooding on the\ncommunity, flood warning and preparedness and environmental considerations.\n\n<strong>Section 3</strong> is a review of possible Floodplain Management Measures which could be included in the\nPlan.\n\n<strong>Section 4</strong> details the selection of Floodplain Management Measures. Floodplain Management\nstrategies were assessed using a multi-objective approach based on technical, financial,\nenvironmental and social considerations and a preferred strategy outlined.\n\n<strong>Section 5</strong> presents the elements of the draft Floodplain Risk Management Plan.\n\n<strong>Section 6</strong> contains a list of definitions of flood related terms used in the study\n\n<strong>Section 7</strong> contains a list of references.",

    "title": "NSW Sediment Yield Projections under NARCliM2.0 - 2025",
    "description": "This dataset comprises projected absolute values and projected changes in hillslope erosion (also referred to as sediment yield and soil loss) for all estuaries in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Estimates were derived using the latest New South Wales and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM2.0) climate projections. \n\nThis dataset provides the first process-based, region-wide assessment of soil availability for estuarine intertidal wetlands of NSW, complementing previous studies that focused primarily on the effects of sea-level rise (SLR). Together, these datasets provide a more comprehensive understanding of current and future trends affecting the state’s intertidal wetlands. Datasets of absolute sediment yield are provided as raster files, while differences between historical and projected epochs are supplied as vector files.\n\nHillslope erosion was estimated for each catchment using NARCliM2.0 rainfall projections within the framework of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Projected rainfall data were initially used to estimate rainfall erosivity, one of the five RUSLE parameters. The remaining parameters of the RUSLE retained their previously established values for Southern Australia (Yang, 2014; 2015; Yang et al., 2018) and include soil erodibility (K), cover management (C), slope length and steepness (LS) and the support practice (P). NARCliM2.0 projections were prepared with a 4-km spatial resolution for 2 Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0), derived from 5 global climate models (GCMs) and downscaled to 2 regional climate models (RCMs). The GCMs include: \n<ul>\n<li>ACCESS-ESMI1-5 (CSIRO, Australia) </li>\n<li>EC-Earth3-Veg (EC-EARTH consortium, The Netherlands and Ireland) </li>\n<li>MPI–ESM1-2-HR (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Germany)</li>\n<li>NorESM2-MM (Norwegian Climate Center, Norway) </li>\n<li>UKESM1-0-LL (Met Office and Natural Environment Research Council, UK)</li>\n</ul>\n\nRainfall projections were interpolated to a 100-metre spatial resolution to match the remaining RUSLE factors. The absolute sediment yield values were then generated for all estuarine catchments in NSW for one historical epoch (1990–2009) and three future epochs:\n<ul>\n<li>Near Future (NF): 2020–2039</li>\n<li>Mid Future (MF): 2050–2069</li>\n<li>Far Future (FF): 2080–2099</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe historical epoch serves as the baseline, against which differences for each future epoch were calculated. These 20-year future periods were selected to capture adequate climatic variability while maintaining near-stationarity of climate variables within an epoch. \n\nTo ensure comparability, differences in sediment yield are presented as percentage change relative to the baseline using a consistent colour ramp with 18 bins (10% intervals) ranging from –80% to 80%. Differences in sediment yield increase from red (negative) to blue (positive), where red indicates projected decreases and blue indicates projected increases relative to the historical period. \n\nDetailed information on file naming conventions, raster files, and shapefile attributes is provided in the accompanying ReadMe documentation. Readers are also encouraged to refer to the accompanying scientific article (under review) for detailed information on the methodology, assumptions, and modelling procedures.",

    "description": "This identifies the land to which the LEP applies under clause 1.3 of the LEP. This is usually the whole local government area, but certain land may be excluded. The LAP dataset describes the land to which a LEP applies. Land can either be included or excluded from the LEP. Land may be excluded from the LEP due to it being a Deferred Matter, or covered by a SEPP or other planning instrument.\n The original GIS data was captured by local councils, DP&amp;I and contractors and provided in accordance with the DP&amp;I's Standard Requirements for GIS LEP data and Standard Technical Requirements for LEP maps. Before the LEP is notified on the NSW Legislation website, the mapping is checked by DP&amp;I and the Parliamentary Council's Office to ensure that it is consistent with these standards. After the LEP is notified, the GIS data is quality controlled using an ISO 9001-Quality-Certified, Quality Management System and incorporated into the Statewide dataset.\n The Land Application data relates directly to and adopts the accuracy of its reference dataset, Land and Property Information DCDB. The GIS data may be subject to change as a part of quality control, or if the LEP is amended. Please confirm dates of respective features before use as this dataset has a large temporal extent.",

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.Spatial Resolution - 6 cmSpatial Accuracy - +/- 3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)Map Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary SphereRectification Surface - DTM (supplied by DNRM in .img format)Description of Rectification - High end commercial photogrammetric software and Aerometrex proprietary software has been utilised in the ortho rectification and mosaicing process. This methodology assists Aerometrex to produce a seamless geo-referenced orthophotography product.Tile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km GeoTIFF TilesLimitations of DataThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "A Neighbourhood Safer Place is a place of last resort during a bush fire emergency. They are to be used when all other options in your Bush Fire Survival Plan cannot be put into action safely. A NEIGHBOURHOOD SAFER PLACE DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY. You should be aware of any Neighbourhood Safer Places in your area, and note them in your Bush Fire Survival Plan before a bush fire occurs. If there is no Neighbourhood Safer Place in your area, you should identify other safer locations you can go to as a last resort, such as a nearby home which is well prepared, shopping centre or oval, which are well away from the bush. If it is unsafe to leave the area or take shelter in your property, and the path is clear, you should move to your pre-identified Neighbourhood Safer Places, or other safer location, well before the impact of a bush fire. Attempting to travel to an Neighbourhood Safer Places too late can introduce more risks than sheltering in place. Conditions at the Neighbourhood Safer Place may be uncomfortable and you may be affected by heat, smoke and embers. Water, toilets and food may not be available at the Neighbourhood Safer Place and emergency service personnel may not be present. Neighbourhood Safer Places are not designed for pets and large animals. LEAVING EARLY, WELL BEFORE A FIRE THREATENS, IS ALWAYS THE SAFEST OPTION.\nMetadata\nTypeUpdate FrequencyAs NeededContact Detailsgis@rfs.nsw.gov.auRelationship to Themes and DatasetsData ProviderAccuracy50mStandards and SpecificationsAggregatorsNSW Rural Fire ServiceDistributorsNSW Rural Fire ServiceDataset Producers and ContributorsNSW Rural Fire Service",

    "description": "Phytoplankton and physico-chemical monitoring along the River Murray were established in 1978 under the River Murray Water Quality Monitoring Program (RMWQMP).\r\n\r\nThe phytoplankton component began with sites spread across NSW, Victoria, and SA from the NSW upper Murray to the SA Lower Lakes. With the number of sites reconciled in 1980, phytoplankton monitoring has continued at 12 sites, with 10 sites along the River Murray and 2 sites near the confluence of the main tributaries, being the Darling and Murrumbidgee rivers. \r\n\r\nBiological parameters monitored comprise phytoplankton, phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a.  For further details refer to accompanying PDF the [phytoplankton metadata statement](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/river-murray-water-quality-monitoring-program/resource/0e0a5050-8b2f-4ce3-ab16-8b749c0a38bf).\r\n\r\nThe physico-chemical component began with 32 sites along the Murray River and various tributaries, increasing to 35 sites in 1980 then reducing to 28 sites (along with some frequency changes) in 2012.\r\n\r\nPhysico-chemical parameters monitored vary but include temperate, EC, pH, turbidity, colour, TKN, NOx, Total P, FRP, silica, DOC, bicarbonate, sulfate, and metals. The range of parameters and frequency of monitoring undertaken at a site is determined by the site class as described in Physico-chemical meta data statement.

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Resource Management in Asia-Pacific (RMAP) Program based at The Australian National University in Canberra.\n*****\nThe experience of the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas (FLMMA) network provides an illustration of how to mainstream community-based resource management practices that began with local communities, and were in-turn supported by a Government which has witnessed the success of community-based intervention. To improve the success of conservation in the communities and attract attention to its approach, FLMMA formed a learning portfolio. This is a network of projects that use a common strategy to achieve a common end and agree to work together to collect, test and communicate information about the conditions under which the strategy works, to enable the partners to exchange ideas and experiences. The learning portfolio enhances collaboration and also ensures that lessons learnt are shared widely with people in the network. FLMMA is working to increase the effectiveness of conservation and to ensure that the involvement of people in the management of their marine resources is both satisfying and meaningful. \n\nModern science is an important part of the FLMMA approach because it is used to demonstrate the effects of the use of traditional resource management practices. Using simple biological, social, and economic monitoring methods, the villagers are collecting impressive results on resources and habitat recovery and the associated social and economic improvements in living conditions. The objectives of improving conservation to protect biodiversity and improve people's living conditions are important features of the kind of community-based resource conservation that is now being undertaken in the Pacific and Asia region. The objectives are also consistent with national policies for inshore fisheries development and global concerns about poverty alleviation. \n\nThe success of community-based conservation in different parts of Fiji has resulted in long-term support from the communities. It has also facilitated the articulation of Government fisheries development policies. The Government has set up a new conservation unit and has formalised its support, and adopted the FLMMA method of involving local community units in the sustainable use of their marine resources. Under FLMMA, the success and combined experiences of conservation practitioners are being used to mainstream resource conservation and influence policy development in Fiji.",

The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55.

    "description": "An access-restricted basemap image service that displays the latest high resolution authoritative general reference imagery datasets captured by remotely piloted aircraft systems (drones) and piloted aircraft over areas of Queensland under the Spatial Imagery Services Program  (SISP).This basemap service is designed to provide access to the latest State Remotely Sensed Image Library collection of aerial imagery captured under SISP.Basemap services comprise a single layer of static imagery optimised for display purposes. This service can be used in dynamic mode to filter and display individual project areas. The projects range from 2cm to 50cm resolution. Accuracy is dependent on the individual projects. Periodical updates will be made to the service as new projects are captured. Projects are visible at a regional scale of 1:250,000.The images comprised in each of the projects are orthorectified which removes the effects of image perspective (tilt) and relief (terrain) effects for the purpose of creating a planimetrically correct image. The resultant orthorectified images have a constant scale wherein features are represented in their “true” positions.This service supports projects captured in both GDA94 and GDA2020 datums. A Seven parameter similarity transformation has been applied to new projects that have been captured in GDA2020, this is to ensure that they align and display correctly when published in the default WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) projection alongside GDA94 projects.If you would like to receive updates for new projects, functionality or planned downtime please subscribe here: http://ems.gs/3qln0ijbKGR.",

It is available as a resource and reference, to assist in the future selection and planting of trees on public and private land. For more information on its use and development refer to the  Tree Species List – Development and Use Report.  The City of Sydney Tree Species List (the list) is a list of trees considered to be appropriate for planting within our local area. The list was developed with the assistance of professional arboricultural consultants, academics, landscape architects, an Indigenous consultant and experienced urban forest practitioners. It is hoped that the list will be a valuable resource and reference, to assist in the future selection and planting of trees on public and private land.  Selecting the most appropriate tree to be planted is an important process. It can be crucial to the long-term success of a landscape. To get the best results for the City or your project, the right tree must be planted in the right place, and at the right time. It can also be complicated, with many factors to be considered and balanced before arriving at a decision. The data presented in the list will help to narrow down the potential options, to arrive at tree species that are most appropriate, based on the various site conditions, the design attributes, and any personal preferences. This FAQ answers some key questions and provides a short guide to help.

Values 3 and 4 combine to form Rank 2 that identifies moderate conservation value foraging habitat. Rank 0 is habitat containing no foraging resources (as recognised by methodology used). Note that introduced species (e.g. mango trees) are not included in this analysis. Data also includes bi-monthly habitat scores. d_j identifies December and January. f_m identified February and March etc…\n\n•\tThe GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW Government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\no\tOnce this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.

    "title": "The Edith River uranium-bearing area",
    "description": "In the Edith River area uranium occurs as meta-autunite associated with apatite and hematite in narrow siliceous reef formations which are in part brecciated and mylonized. The reefs, which dip steeply west and strike mostly north-north-west, occur over a length of about 3 miles in a north-south, sheared greisenized, zone in granite. Two main types of granite are present, a coarse grained granite and a finer-grained adamellite, which is intrusive into the coarse granite. In places partial digestion of the coarse by the fine granite has produced a porphyritic \"hybrid\" granite. All granites except the greisenized granite of the sheared zone give high background counts, 2 to 3 times as high as that of the sediments of the Brocks Creek group into which the coarse granite is intrusive. Within the reef formations the distribution of uranium-bearing material is patchy. In many places the best geiger readings are obtained where cross reefs or fractures with a north easterly strike cut the main reefs. Surface samples were taken across most places where significant Geiger readings were obtained and all returned less than .1% U3O8. Commercial production from the field will only be possible if the grade of the original ore has been greatly affected by surface leaching and a site was selected for a shaft to test the primary ore.",
