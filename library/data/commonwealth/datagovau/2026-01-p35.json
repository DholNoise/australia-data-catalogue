    "description": "Detailed models, embedded within the MECO circulation model, of the primary production and nutrient cycling on the NWS. And a detailed model of the NWS food-web was developed using the Ecopath-Ecosim-Ecospace models and software (Bulman et al 2006), Also an agent-based model of the food-web was developed for the NWS, but was found to be slow and inefficient at large space scales and to give very similar outputs to the faster model of Bulman et al.(2006). From examination of all these models it was found that there was very little interaction between the human uses examined by the MSE and primary productivity, nutrient cycling or the food-web. Instead the major affects of the human uses were through the more direct consequences of harvesting, habitat modification and water quality. With respect to fisheries this is consistent with the findings of Sainsbury (1988). So while these other factors were maintained in the MSE model, primary production, nutrient cycling and trophic interactions were not explicitly included. At higher exploitation rates and contamination levels, or a different set of human uses, than is currently envisaged on the NWS it is likely that the impacts on primary production, nutrient cycling and trophic interactions would become important.",

    "description": "A manipulative field experiment was used to assess the spatial variation in the effect of copper on sessile invertebrates within a marina in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. Sessile invertebrate assemblages were grown on perspex plates for 6 weeks and then dosed with plaster blocks impregnated with copper sulfate. After 1 week of exposure to the copper the plates were collected and the numbers of sponges, polychaetes, barnacles, bryozoans and ascidians were counted on each plate. The variation in abundances of individual taxa were estimated at spatial scales of metres. Water flow was measured as a possible explanation for the variation in the effects of copper. \n\nThree of the 20 sessile invertebrates species showed significant small scale variation in the effect of copper. The effects of copper on these species varied in magnitude and direction. Water flow did not explain the variation in the effects of copper. It is suggested that variations in organic or inorganic compounds or in pH levels may provide alternative explanations for the spatially variable effects of copper in the marina.",

    "description": "Data Notes:\n\n\nData is collected mid-year (census date: first Friday in August) from NSW government schools as per National Schools Statistics Collection (NSSC).\n\n\nData excludes support students.\n\n\nStudents in Years 11 or 12 can enrol to study as a part-time or  full-time student. For the annual census, a part-time student is enrolled in less than 10 units, regardless of where those units are studied. All Kindergarten to Year 10 students are considered to be full-time.\n\n\nStudent enrolments are generally reported in full-time equivalent units (FTE). The FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.\n\n\nIn most scholastic years there are a small number of students in atypical age groups. For students under 18 years, these have been included in the nearest band. This is indicated with an asterisk. As a result, the sum of each row may not equal the totals reported. Mature-age students’ data (18 years old and above) is not anonymised. \n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin. Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) indicators by activity node locations for the year of 2011.\nSNAMUTS Australia is a multiple indicator tool to assess public transport network performance and land use-transport integration in Australia's five largest metropolitan areas (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), at SA1 level and for specified activity nodes in the census years 2011, 2016 and 2021. SNAMUTS is a decision-making support tool designed to inform strategies for public transport infrastructure and service improvements, land use intensification and overall metropolitan strategic planning. It also allows for timeline and city-to-city comparisons on public transport performance and accessibility indicators between about 30 cities on four continents.\nSNAMUTS has been developed and refined with funding from the Australian Research Council (DP110104884), the European Science Foundation (COST TU1002), the Cities of Melbourne, Manningham and Perth, internal support through RMIT University, Curtin University and University of Melbourne, the Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre (SBENRC), AURIN and in-kind support by the University of Porto, Goudappel Coffeng, University of Amsterdam, University of Gothenburg, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Concordia University and University of Westminster.\nThese are known as the eight key SNAMUTS indicators, they include:\n- Transfer intensity (degree centrality)\n- Ease of movement (closeness centrality),\n- Geographical reach of public transport journeys (30-minute contour catchment)\n- Spatial concentration of public transport journey paths (betweenness centrality and transfer propensity)\n- Flexibility of movement (nodal connectivity)\n- Future-proofness of the network (nodal resilience)\n- A composite index for overall public transport accessibility.\nIt is based on public transport network and timetable information available publicly through transport agencies (Adelaide Metro, Translink, PTV, Transperth, TfNSW) and ABS census data (usual residential population and journey-to-work destinations) for the three years (2011, 2016, 2021). This data can be viewed in conjunction with the corresponding routes dataset: \"SNAMUTS - Route Segment (Polyline) 2011\".\nFor more information, please refer to the SNAMUTS website. A full list of SNAMUTS publications can be found at http://www.snamuts.com/publications.html.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of general practitioner (GP) and specialist attendances by age group and sex. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nGP after-hours attendances are Medicare benefit-funded after-hours patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. They include urgent and non-urgent attendances.\n\n\nSpecialist attendances are Medicare benefits-funded referred patient/doctor encounters, such as visits, consultations, and attendances by video conference, involving medical practitioners who have been recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for Medicare benefits purposes.\n\n",

    "description": "To date the Mosquito Creek field appears primarily to be a good gouger's prospect. It could carry one Company operating a small plant but not as at present three or four Companies. However, the whole of the exposed granite rock has not been prospected, and the possibilities of the field not realised. It is possible that lodes of payable width, i.e. 3 ft or more, may be located in the future. The veins proved to date are thin but are numerous, persist over long distances and carry value at depth. Valuation of scheelite ground is by no means as simple as has been reported in the press. Wind and rain have concentrated the ore in the surface soil covering these numerous veins, over widths up to 20 feet. These areas of quartz-scheelite are easily located by the use of an ultra-violet lamp and could be stripped by bulldozers. The obvious action for any company interested in this field would be [as follows]. 1. To satisfy themselves by trial of the commercial value of the strippings. 2. To carry out active exploration and cover by mining lease large areas of scheelite veined granite. 3. To consider the thickest reefs so exposed at a later date. The existing companies have not been alive to the possibilities of the field, have purchased at high cost small leases and exuded a great deal of hot air. The further possibilities of the field are reasonably good and depend primarily on the recovery of scheelite by bull-dozing to shallow depth veined granite.",

    "description": "Some experimental geophysical work was undertaken by the Bureau of Mineral Resources at the Moura Coalfield in Queensland in order to investigate the structure of coal seams which lie within 1000 feet of the surface. The aim of the survey was to evaluate the use of geophysical techniques for locating faults of small displacement. Most of the effort was concentrated on shallow seismic reflection techniques but additional techniques (magnetic, gravity, resistivity, electromagnetic and induced polarization) were used. \n\nThe whole area of the survey was covered with a close-spaced grid of gravity and magnetic stations. A lesser effort was devoted to resistivity, electromagnetic, and induced polarization methods, the object being to take advantage of the opportunity to tryout these relatively inexpensive methods in the hope that they might give some indications of fault locations. These methods will be evaluated in a separate Record; this one deals- with the results of the seismic work. Encouraging results were obtained from seismic reflection work. The uppermost economic coal seam was mapped to within 300 feet of the surface and areas of faulting could be deduced from time differences and lack of continuity in reflections.",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains the shapefiles and grids of the total upstream catchment areas for the 30 surface water receptor sites in the Gloucester subregion. Catchment areas were calculated using the BA SYD Albers projection.\n\n\n\nGDA_1994_BA_SYD_Albers\n\nAuthority: Custom\n\n\n\nProjection: Albers\n\nFalse_Easting: 0.0\n\nFalse_Northing: 0.0\n\nCentral_Meridian: 151.0\n\nStandard_Parallel_1: -18.0\n\nStandard_Parallel_2: -36.0\n\nLatitude_Of_Origin: 0.0\n\nLinear Unit: Meter (1.0)\n\n\n\nGeographic Coordinate System: GCS_GDA_1994\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nTotal upstream catchement areas were generated using the ArcGIs 10.1 Spatial Analyst Watershed function on each receptor location. The input pour points and flow direction raster are those indicated in the lineage. To generate total catchments rather than nested catchments the watershed function was run separately on each point feature in the receptor shapefile. This process was automated in a Python script which is also included (though note that paths specified in the script are legacy paths from when the script was run and accessed and output data in a local workspace environment).\n\n\n\nThe script also converts the output watershed rasters to individual receptor catchment shapfiles. However, there is also a merged feature dataset in the file geodatabase.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) GLO SW receptor total catchment areas V01.

    "description": "The ISC2010_BARE_GROUND_S table is the Statistical Summary table for the Bare Ground Metric at the 100m Section level.\n\nThe ISC2010_BARE_GROUND_S table is designed to JOIN to the ISC2010_RIVER_CENTRELINES_S feature class.\n\nRiver condition in Victoria is assessed every 5 years using the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem (SA3 code 70203) and East Arnhem (SA3 code 70204) are combined in the original data. AURIN has assigned the results for these regions to the boundary of Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem and excluded the boundary of East Arnhem from this dataset.\n\n",

The SBP120 provides a 3° by 3° angular resolution.\nThe echosounder's frequency sweep range is from 2.5 to 7 kHz. The SBP29 was logged continuously for the extent of the voyage.\nData are stored in .raw (366 files 8.12 GB) raw and .seg (358 files 8.01 GB) segy formats at CSIRO.\nThe segy format data had a real time processing stream applied, which applies gain, a gain correction, matched filter with replica shaping, an attribute calculation for instantaneous amplitude and time variable gain.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "The Australian National Facility for Ocean Gliders (ANFOG), with IMOS/NCRIS funding, deploys a fleet of eight gliders around Australia.\n\nThe underwater ocean glider represents a technological revolution for oceanography. Autonomous ocean gliders can be built relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusables allowing them to make repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal ecosystems.\n\nThe ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders. \nSlocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator), manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m) were high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have three Slocum gliders for deployment on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. ANFOG uses their five Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical, chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders, due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position and depth\n\nSustained ocean observations will allow researchers to document the natural variability of the ocean, and better understand the effect of climate change on coastal ecosystems. The IMOS gliders will focus particularly on the major boundary currents that run down the Australia coast, the Leeuwin in the west and the East Australian Current (EAC). The study of these currents is critical for understanding the north-south transport of freshwater, heat and biogeochemical properties. The currents exert a large influence on coastal ecosystems, shipping lanes and fisheries.\n\nFollowing a public call for proposals in 2007 for the IMOS infrastructure, the ocean gliders have been allocated to four projects which will be coordinated by research teams at four of the IMOS Science Nodes:\n-NSW-IMOS (Exploring hydrodgraphy and fluorescence in the East Australian Current, its eddy field and in the Tasman front) \n-Bluewater (Monitoring the Southward extension of the East Australian Current)\n-SAIMOS (Boundary and shelf currents exchange with the shelves of South Australia and Victoria)\n-WAIMOS (Understand the role of the Leeuwin current system in controlling not only the marine life but also the climate of south western Australia)",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme. This dataset was derived from multiple datasets. You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThis database supersedes initial PED AssetList database V1 20150313 (GUID 84251560-5af2-490e-a4d8-6208ef91ae62) by adding the missed point SA state economic data. This dataset contains the spatial and non-spatial (attribute) components of the Pedirka subregion Asset List as one .mdb file, which is readable as an MS Access database and an ESRI personal geodatabase. \n\n\n\nUnder the BA programme, a spatial assets database is developed for each defined bioregional assessment project. The spatial elements that underpin the identification of water dependent assets are identified in the first instance by regional NRM organisations (via the WAIT tool) and supplemented with additional elements from national and state/territory government datasets. All reports received associated with the WAIT process for Pedirka are included in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nElements are initially included in the preliminary assets database if they are partly or wholly within the subregion's preliminary assessment extent (Materiality Test 1, M1). Elements are then grouped into assets which are evaluated by project teams to determine whether they meet the second Materiality Test (M2). Assets meeting both Materiality Tests comprise the water dependent asset list. Descriptions of the assets identified in the Pedirka subregion are found in the \"AssetList\" table of the database. In this version of the database only M1 has been assessed. \n\n\n\nAssets are the spatial features used by project teams to model scenarios under the BA programme. Detailed attribution does not exist at the asset level. Asset attribution includes only the core set of BA-derived attributes reflecting the BA classification hierarchy, as described in Appendix A of \"PED_asset_database_doc_20150319.doc \", located in the zip file as part of this dataset. \n\n\n\nThe \"Element_to_Asset\" table contains the relationships and identifies the elements that were grouped to create each asset. Detailed information describing the database structure and content can be found in the document \"PED_asset_database_doc_20150319.doc\" located in the zip file. \n\n\n\nSome of the source data used in the compilation of this dataset is restricted.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThis is a complete list of assets in this subregion to be assessed by the bioregional assessment programme as of 19th March, 2015.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nVersionID\tDate\t             Notes\n\n1.0\t              13/03/2015\tInitial database\n\n1.1\t              19/03/2015\tAdd SA point Eco data (2 assets and 28 Elements) and fixed Note field values and some AIDs in table AssetDecisions\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2014) Asset database for the Pedirka subregion on 19 March 2015.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to deaths due to all causes (combined) by sex. The reported statistics include year of death, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates, rate ratio, median age at death, premature deaths, potential years of life lost and potentially avoidable deaths. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2017 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC09) was collected from a depth of 166m within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The data from stable isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber were analysed to allow a preliminary understanding of the hemipelagic sedimentary environment over the last glacial / interglacial cycle. The results suggest that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~60cm depth, corresponding to isotopically heavier 18O. Other parameters were also analysed to assist in reaching this conclusion. This would give a relatively low sedimentation rate of 3cm / kyr, compared to 50cm / kyr for similar depths in the west Queensland trough.",

    "description": "Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) - Vegetation Complexes - SCP250k\n\nThe dataset shows pre-1750 distribution of vegetation complexes characteristic of various combinations of landforms, soils and rainfall along the Swan Coastal Plain south of Lancelin. For the majority of this area, the vegetation complexes are those defined by Heddle et al. (1980) at the scale of 1:250,000 and include some minor attribution corrections undertaken in 2015.\n\nThe Heddle mapping was restricted to the System 6 area and thus the vegetation complex mapping did not extend to the far southern section of Swan Coastal Plain. This southern section was subsequently captured by Webb et al. (2016) at a scale of 1:250,000. The 2016 mapping also consolidated the vegetation complex boundaries along the Whicher and Darling scarp interface using complexes defined by Mattiske &amp; Havel (1990), soil landscape phases (DAFWA 2007) and information in Hagan et al. (2011).\n\nSee additional metadata for information on the location of summary descriptions of each complex and references. ",

This historical dataset is out of date and no longer updated.  The data is spatially available as a layer on the Protected Matters Search Tool on the DCCEEW website. \nIt is a polygon coverage representing the wetlands cited in the \"A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia\" Third Edition (EA, 2001), plus various additions for wetlands listed after 2001.\nThis coverage is a compilation of various data sources and has been collected using a variety of methods. This dataset was used as an indicative guide only to wetland boundaries and locations. The data has been collated by the Australian Government from various datasets including those supplied by the relevant State agencies.\nState agency contributors include the Queensland Environmental Protection Authority, NSW Department of Environment and Conservation and the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment.\nFor the identification of wetland boundaries or locations in regard to the compliance of activities with relevant State legislation, the relevant State authority should be contacted to obtain the most recent and accurate wetland boundary information available.\nThe criteria for the definition of a wetland used in this dataset is that adopted by the Ramsar Convention, namely: \"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters.\"",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth aged younger than 20 years who smoked at any time during pregnancy, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC) and historical data for time trends. Where the term 'teenage mother' is used the analysis is based on women who gave birth aged under 20. Teenage mothers and their babies are more likely to experience broader disadvantage, have antenatal risk factors and have poorer maternal and baby outcomes during and after birth, than older mothers and their babies. \nThe Teenage Mothers in Australia data accompanies the Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Teenage Mothers in Australia 2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nExcludes women for whom smoking status at any time during pregnancy was 'Not stated' and women not usually resident in Australia or whose usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nUsers must attribute the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy as the data provider.",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the rangeland grazing system model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This report examines three potential outlook scenarios for Australia's forestry sector using analysis of the potential availability and use of logs, forecasts of wood product consumption, and the opportunities for processing of wood products and investment. \r\n\r\n ABARES conducted a number of workshops with industry and government stakeholders to refine the scenarios and test the assumptions supporting this analysis. A business-as-usual scenario was analysed, which depicts a future assuming current economic, policy and environmental factors affecting the forestry sector remain unchanged over the projection period (to 2050). Two alternative scenarios (priority-to-productivity and constrained-wood-production) are also examined. Sensitivity testing was also conducted to identify the influence of key parameters. \r\n\r\n The analysis in this report highlights some key opportunities for Australia's forestry sector, as well as the economic and policy factors required for realising these opportunities. The results affirm that a positive investment environment for upgrading and expanding wood processing infrastructure will underpin growth in Australia's forestry sector. ",

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Perth) with SA2 code (51041).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Perth City SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2016 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

These zones have been subject to cleanup in line with the relevant environmental standards. However, restrictions remain on what the water can be used for if it is extracted via a groundwater bore.\nGQRUZ do not represent a comprehensive list of all sites where groundwater quality may not be suitable for use.  Rather, they represent locations where EPA has formally recognised that groundwater is polluted, following site investigations under EPA's environmental audit program.  Other sources of information on groundwater quality include EPA's Priority Sites Register, which lists sites which are currently undergoing clean-up under EPA's compliance and enforcement activities.\nThis dataset is in spatial format and contains a map of GQRUZ across Victoria.",

    "description": "One of the few remaining pristine coastal environments in the world, the Kimberley is highly valued for its biodiversity, cultural values, tourism and fisheries. The biodiversity of the Kimberley coast is fuelled by oceanic and terrestrially derived nutrient resources, yet there has been limited prior research about how nutrients vary or how they are used and recycled across the region. Building this understanding is essential to inform future management of the Kimberley coast and marine parks.\nThis project has therefore been undertaken to address both of the major research priorities emphasised in the Kimberley Marine Research Program Science Plan: (a) providing the bio-physical characterisation required for marine resource management and (b) improving understanding of ecosystem function and how this might change in response to future trends in human use. In particular, this project has aimed to elucidate the processes controlling carbon and nutrient flows through pelagic ecosystems in the Kimberley region. Specifically, we have sought to link physical processes and riverine inputs to food web structure and function, improving process understanding of pathways and material flows that connect habitats, populations and bioregions in the Kimberley. We have identified sources of nutrients and how they translate to productivity for consumers, and through this work have supported the development of an improved understanding of how such processes may be modified by a changing climate.\n\nData is stored on Pawsey Data Portal (https://data.pawsey.org.au/public/?path=/WA Node Ocean Data Network/WAMSI2/KMRP/2.2/2.2.2) available after embargo.",

Updates to the data are published annually with a one-year lag.\n\nIt is not appropriate to use the :Market-C/ series as a proxy for\nforeign exchange market intervention. The RB engages in spot or forward\ntransactions with dealers in the market virtually every day. Most of these\ntransactions are not intended to influence the exchange rate. Rather, they\noccur to cover orders for foreign exchange from clients such as the Australian\nGovernment. When the RB sells foreign exchange to a client, it has the choice\nof meeting this out of its holdings of foreign exchange or buying the\nequivalent amount of foreign exchange in the market. Most of the time it does\nthe latter, though even then the timing of the sale and purchase may not\ncoincide precisely. The RB can also engage in foreign exchange transactions\nwith counterparties other than dealers as a means of covering client orders.\n\nDaily net foreign exchange transactions, net sales (-) and purchases (+), are\nreported according to the date on which the trade took place. This is in\ncontrast to the monthly transactions data in Table A.4, which are reported\naccording to the day on which settlement took place. Another difference to\nTable A.4 is that interest received on holdings of foreign assets is not\nincluded.\n\naMarketa transactions are foreign exchange transactions against the Australian\ndollar (excluding foreign exchange swaps) undertaken by the RB with\nauthorised foreign exchange dealers in Australia or banks overseas.\n\naGovernment and other counterpartiesa transactions include the RBAas foreign\nexchange transactions with the Australian Government, outright transactions\nwith other central banks and international financial institutions that are not\nintended to affect the exchange rate, and transactions with clients other than\nthe Australian Government.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2006 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who had an episiotomy when giving birth for the first time and giving birth vaginally and instrumentally, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their first baby who had an episiotomy during an instrumental vaginal birth, divided by the number of females having their first baby who gave birth vaginally and had an instrumental vaginal birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who gave birth for the first time and had a vaginal birth, with or without instruments. Females who had a multiple birth are included if this was the first time they had given birth.\n\n\nExcluded are those females who did not give birth for the first time or gave birth by caesarean section.\n\n\nInstrumental vaginal birth means that the baby was delivered with the use of forceps or vacuum extraction.\n\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting these results. There was no standardised collection across jurisdictions for the data used to derive this indicator.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, a combined laceration and episiotomy value could be recorded; from 2014 onwards, episiotomy could be recorded separately.\n\n\nData were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘vh_vulnerability.shp’ contains polygon data indicating the approximate area of the perched aquifer that is at very high risk from water contamination and over extraction.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behavior on the island.  The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the very high vulnerability boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods.\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The data shows business establishments with their trading name, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, location and CLUE block and small area allocation. The data covers the year period of 2014.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has acquired the data through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "Herbivory is a key ecological process that sustains food webs, and can regulate the biomass of primary producers in an ecosystem. It has long been hypothesized that rates of herbivory are greatest in the tropics, although strong evidence to support this is limited. The aim of this project was to identify the key species of herbivores, to identify the grazing rates of key herbivores, and in conjunction with project WAMSI 2 KMRP Project 2.2.4 (benthic primary productivity) provide estimates of the proportion of production that is consumed by herbivores. \nThe research on herbivory was focused on the islands and coast of the Bardi Jawi Indigenous Protected Area in the Kimberley (Western Australia), encompassing Jalan (Tallon Island) and Iwany (Sunday Island). Focus of the herbivory study was on one type of habitat (seagrass meadows), and the diet of two species of herbivores (golden-lined rabbitfish and green turtle).\nFour surveys were conducted between October 2014 and April 2016. At these locations the following measurements or collections were made (not all measurements were made during each survey):\n(1) Rates of herbivory (three surveys). These data are presented in the report for WAMSI KMRP 2.2.4, here the focus is on assessing rates of herbivory as a proportion of primary production; \n(2) Collections of golden-lined rabbitfish (Siganus lineatus); and \n(3) Blood samples from green turtles (Chelonia mydas).\nTen green turtles were tagged with satellite tags: 4 in April 2015, and 6 in April 2016.\nThis data record only pertains to data held by CSIRO. For access to all other data generated by collaborative research partners of the KMRP 1.1.2 project refer to the additional metadata field.",

    "description": "Water resources data for Christmas Island were assembled as part of ongoing groundwater investigations and monitoring undertaken on Christmas Island during the period from October 1996 to June 1999. \nThe shapefile ‘Perched_aquifer_line.shp’ contains line data indicating the approximate boundary of the perched aquifer on Christmas Island.\nAccuracy: The estimated extent of the boundary is based on information from salinity monitoring boreholes and some estimation based on knowledge of freshwater aquifer behavior on the island.  The boundaries are somewhat subjective and are in fact not fixed, as they will move according to wet and dry periods. Hence it is difficult to a generate an accuracy estimate. It could be said that the very perched aquifer boundary would normally be within 30m of the boundary shown, but this could be greater during very dry or very wet periods\nLayers were supplied as ESRI shapefiles in CIG85 projection. In September 2003, Geoscience Australia projected these shapefiles into the MGA (GDA94) projection using an XY (X=550015, Y=8780001) shift.\nDisclaimer",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The EAC4 deepwater mooring was deployed in April 2012 at (-27.21 S, 154.65 E) off the Queensland coast, near Brisbane, Australia. The mooring was recovered in August 2013 and the array decommissioned, and a newly configured array (with new moorings) was redeployed in May 2015.  \n\nInstrumentation on the mooring includes 75kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (Long Ranger ADCPs), Seabird SBE37SMPs, temperature loggers (Star Oddi, Starmon Mini) and discrete current meters (Aquadopp 6000).\n\nThe mooring will collect a time series of full-depth profiles of water velocity and discrete temperature and salinity measurements. \n\nThe array will consist of 9 current meter and property moorings extending eastward from the Queensland Coastal Node shelf mooring array near Brisbane to the deep ocean. The moorings will be at 500-600 m intervals across the Continental Slope and increasing to 800-1000 m in the deep ocean.  \n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the major western boundary current of the south Pacific Ocean. It plays a critical role in the ocean re-distribution of global heat from the equator to the midand- high latitudes. The EAC is relatively stable north of Brisbane, but as the current moves south 2-3 large eddies are pinched off every year. These eddies frequently move onto the continental shelf and close inshore and influence the local circulation patterns. At prominent coastal features the EAC moves away from the coast, driving upwelling which draws nutrient-rich water from a depth of 200-m or more.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2018 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 28-02-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has been reduced by 5.517MW.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

It allows for the fair distribution of property among creditors and the prosecution of dishonest debtors.\r\n\r\nA debt agreement is an arrangement between a person who cannot pay their debts and their creditors. It is a formal arrangement under Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act. A debt agreement results from creditors voting to accept a proposal from a debtor to settle their debts. To be eligible to propose a debt agreement, a debtor must be insolvent and meet threshold levels relating to unsecured debts and assets and after-tax income.\r\n\r\nPersonal insolvency agreement (PIA): under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act, a personal insolvency agreement results from creditors accepting a debtor’s proposal to settle his or her debts. Unlike debt agreements, personal insolvency agreements are not subject to income, asset or debt thresholds.\r\n\r\nPlease see our guide to learn more about the provisional personal insolvency statistics",

The tests were designed to provide an upper bound estimates of geogenic chemical mobilisation from shale, tight and deep coal gas formations in the Cooper GBA region and is intended to guide future field based monitoring, management, and treatment options.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nLeachate tests were conducted at 80 degC (inorganics) in order to examine elevated temperature conditions that could be present during hydraulic fracturing operations at deep shale gas operations (median aquifer temperature at 1000-2500 m drill hole ~ 80 degC; after removal of unknown, uncorrected, and unidentified data and methodologies in the dataset) (https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/70604). Exploratory studies were also conducted on the effect of pressure (inorganics) that would be present in wells of shale gas operations on geogenic chemical (element) mobilisation into solution from powdered rock samples.",

    "description": "This spatial layer depicts ranked Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat across the Lower Hunter (Port Stephens, Maitland, Cessnock, Lake Macquarie and Newcastle Local Government Areas). Values 1 and 2 combine to form Rank 1 habitat that identifies high conservation value foraging habitat. Values 3 and 4 combine to form Rank 2 that identifies moderate conservation value foraging habitat.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW Government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n* Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "Data collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data covers the period 2002-22. It shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation.\n\nA business establishment is defined as a \n•  Commercial occupant in a building \n•  Separate land use \n•  Any permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\n\nFor more information about CLUE see http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/clue \n\nFor more information about the ANZSIC industry classification system see http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1292.0",

    "description": "This dataset shows the broad groups of crops grown in the main cropping areas of Queensland, for the winter and summer growing seasons from 1990 to the current year. The winter growing-season is defined as June to October, and the summer growing-season is November to May. The predicted group is stored in the attribute table (field 'CLASS'), along with the probability of the prediction (field 'P_CLASS', the larger this value, the more certain is 'CLASS').\n\nEach season has 2 maps: an end-of-season prediction and a mid-season prediction. The mid-season prediction is labelled \"_vInterim\" to indicate that it is based on a relatively short time series and should be used with caution. ",
