    "description": "Areas where solid rock has become exposed to the surface in NSW Zone 56 (from 150°E to east coast). It is used to assist in field mapping. As part of the Geological Survey of NSW Seamless Geology Project, a Bedrock Exposure map of NSW UTM Zone 56 has been created through combining aspects of: (i) Office of Environmental Heritage soil data; (ii) CSIRO depth of regolith dataset and; (iii) the Geological Survey of NSW field observation and structural point dataset. The bedrock exposure map was created to provide a reliable, spatial approximation of exposed bedrock, so as to benefit field mapping. The current maps provided in the UTM Zone 56 Seamless Geodatabase overestimate the amount of exposed bedrock, and therefore, provide only an approximate indication to the location of outcropping basement rocks. The map was created by: (i) using the CSIRO National Soil and Landscape Grid as a base map, and; (ii) refining this by clipping out GSNSW Field Observations, which represent areas of known outcrop. The final result shows the location of estimated and known outcrop.",

    "description": "Measurements of temperature within the snow / firn cover in Wilkes Land East Antarctica were made along the routes of oversnow traverses operating out of Casey (66.6 S 110 E).  In general, measurements were made at a nominal depth of ten metres as a first estimate of mean annual surface temperature of the ice sheet, and for many sites, at some additional depths, typically around twenty metres.  Actual depths of measurements are included with the temperature data as well as date of observation.  No attempt has been made to apply any correction for seasonal or interannual variation.\n\nTwo different methods were used to drill the access holes: an ice coring auger (usually PICO drill, originally SIPRE drill); a steam drill.  In some areas depth of drilling was limited by problems associated with the texture of the firn and difficulties in recovery of material from the hole.\n\nWhere relevant, date of drilling is included with the data, or time elapsed between drilling and temperature measurement.  Temperature measurements were made using 100 ohm platinum resistance elements with resistance measured using a 'Leeds and Northrup' resistance bridge.  The bridge uses a zero/nul measurement technique, thus avoiding heating effects in the sensor Refer quality entry for further details).\n\nThese data form part of the data collected for ASAC projects 456 (Properties and Structure of Antarctic Snow and Ice ), 458 (Characteristics, Dynamics and Mass Budget of the Ice Sheet in Wilkes Land ) and 2224 (Glacier dynamics and mass discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet, 45 degrees -160 degrees E) - ASAC_456, ASAC_458, ASAC_2224).\n\nThe fields in this dataset are:\n\nsite_id (the marker code of the measurement site)\n\nobservation_date (date on which measurement was made, in ISO8601 format yyyy-mm-dd)\n\nobservation_date_year (year of measurement date)\n\nobservation_date_month (month of measurement date)\n\nobservation_date_day (day of measurement date)\n\ntemperature (degrees C)\n\ndepth_of_observation (m)\n\nlatitude\n\nlongitude\n\ndrill_type\n\ndate_drilled\n\ncomment\n\ndays_between_drilling_and_measurement\n\n",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the listed Littoral Rainforest and Coastal Vine Thickets of Eastern Australia found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n• The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n      o Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n• The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n      o Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n\n•\tWhile reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "As part of Geoscience Australia's analysis of the Capel-Faust basins this report summarises the construction methodology and the resulting geological and prospectivity implications of the Capel-Faust 3D geological model. The Capel and Faust basins are located over the northern part of the Lord Howe Rise, a large offshore frontier region composed of a number of rift basins with unknown petroleum prospectivity. Geoscience Australia has been undergoing a program of data acquisition in this area over a number of years, yet most dataset coverage remains regional with little well control. Given the diversity of acquired data, the comparative sparseness of coverage (despite the new data acquisition) and the structural complexity of basins, effective data integration and analysis methods were essential in the Capel-Faust region. By using the 3D visualisation and modelling environment provided by GOCAD, the diverse datasets were captured, processed and interpreted to create an integrated basin model that enabled key geological and prospectivity questions to be answered.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

This extent was identified as the most suitable area to be investigated on land and at sea as part of a conservation planning project looking at coastal development along the GBR coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial part of the coastal zone was initially defined in consultation with stakeholders and included the Queensland Government¿s definition as ¿either: five kilometres from the coastline; or where land first reaches the height of 10 metres Australian Height Datum (AHD), whichever is further from the coast¿ (Queensland Coastal Management Plan). However, the Queensland government definition corresponds to a narrow strip of coastline in most areas and does not encompass most of coastal land uses (and their potential future expansion) that have a significant impact on the marine environmental such as agriculture. In the context of biodiversity conservation and water quality, workshop participants were asked what the coastal zone meant to them. The answers were summarised into four main categories:\r\n1- Intensive coastal-based agriculture,\r\n2- Geomorphological characteristics,\r\n3- Typical coastal vegetation, and\r\n4- Human presence and activities.\r\nThe coastal zone was defined to include all features that would match these four categories, and that also included the Government¿s definition. The marine part of the coastal zone was also defined during this process and the offshore boundary was described as the maximum flood plume extent (secondary flood plume) as in Álvarez-Romero et al. 2013. The extent was smoothed to allow a clear area to be defined. This covers the areas that are have the greatest level of impacts from coastal development, in particular from run-off.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nGBR_coastal_zone.shp (and all associated files as part of the shapefile)\r\nThis dataset contains a polygon that defines the extent of the area identified as the most appropriate coastal zone of the Great Barrier Reef to investigate conservation planning, in particular spatial planning of coastal development to ensure the health for the GBR World Heritage Area.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nÁlvarez-Romero, J. G., M. Devlin, E. Teixeira da Silva, C. Petus, N. C. Ban, R. L. Pressey, J. Kool, J. J. Roberts, S. Cerdeira-Estrada, and A. S. Wenger. 2013.

    "description": "This dataset is the June 2022 release of Geoscape Planning for a single SA2 area (Darwin) with SA2 code (71002).\nPlanning provides detailed planning zone codes and descriptions for parcels of land across Australia. By representing the detailed planning classification for each parcel as well as links to the relevant planning scheme/instrument. Planning provides a simple lookup for the classification on sites nationally, as well as linkages to enable further understanding of a site's potential. Planning is created through combining Geoscape Australia's Cadastre product with Planning Zones defined by a State, Territory or Local Government.\nFor more information regarding Geoscape Planning, please refer to the Data Product Description and the June 2022 Release Notes.\nPlease note: As per the licence for this data, the information is limited to a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) mentioned above as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If you require additional data beyond a single SA2 for your research, please request a quote from AURIN.\nPlanning zones provide a method to divide land and describe the types of development that may occur at a location, and often describe other developmental requirements such as the height, setback or form of the structures that can be built. Planning zones allow State, Territory and local Governments to facilitate urban planning and control the development of land.\nThrough representing the planning classification from a planning zone at a Cadastre cadastral parcel level, Planning provides a granular representation of the potential for development at each site, alongside URL linkages to enable further research directly from the authoritative definition.\nThis dataset has been restricted to the Darwin City SA2 by AURIN. AURIN has extracted the selected SA2 area information from this dataset through using geometries from the May 2022 Geoscape Cadastre release. The dataset, therefore, is a tabular dataset for the selected SA2 area. ",

As part of this update, the previous data API has been decommissioned. While the datasets remain accessible, they may no longer be fully functional, and are currently under review.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.bnefoodtrucks.com.au\">Brisbane Food Trucks website</a> is a one-stop-shop for gourmet food trucks. The website allows food truck operators to create profiles, upload menu information and take advantage of GPS technology to enable customers to track their location.\n\nTo help third parties promote Brisbane Food Trucks, we have enabled a data API. This release is one-way data feed only. The intent of the API is to allow external parties to replicate the mapping feature provided by the site.\n\nThis dataset provides details of the Council sites that are available for approved Gourmet Food trucks to book and was created using the API.

    "title": "Identification of corridors of river recovery for NSW Hawkesbury Nepean catchments",
    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Hawkesbury Nepean catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow. Data accessed from The Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data Portal.\nThis work is funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage project based at Macquarie University with industry partners Landcare Australia and Hunter-Central Rivers Local Land Services. \nThis work is published in two Open Access papers:\n\nAgnew D, Fryirs K (2022) Identifying corridors of river recovery in coastal NSW Australia, for use in river management decision support and prioritisation systems.

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "BMT WBM was commissioned by Bankstown City Council to prepare a Flood Study for the Cooks\nRiver stormwater catchment. Similar studies were simultaneously commissioned for the Punchbowl,\nthe Georges Hall, the Lansdowne and the Miller Road stormwater catchments. The location of the\nCooks River stormwater catchment is shown in Figure 1-1.\n\nThe study has been undertaken under the direction of Bankstown City Council and their Floodplain\nManagement Committee. The Committee includes Councillors and Council staff, officers from the\nOffice of Environment &amp; Heritage (OEH), the State Emergency Service and community\nrepresentatives.\nThe study investigates flood behaviour throughout the Cooks River stormwater catchment for existing\ncatchment conditions as at 2012. This includes the analysis of:\n<ul>\n<li>Flows within the underground pipe drainage network; and</li>\n<li>Surface runoff across the catchment.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA two-dimensional computer model was established for the catchment to analyse stormwater flood\nbehaviour under existing catchment conditions. The model provides information on the extent of flood\ninundation, flood depths and flood velocities throughout the catchment for design floods ranging from\nrelatively frequent events to more extreme floods. Full details are outlined in the Cooks River\nCatchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as Appendix C.\n\nResults from this study will form the technical basis for the Floodplain Risk Management Study. The\nFloodplain Risk Management Study will identify areas of high flood risk and investigate options to\nmanage and reduce this risk. Assistance will be sought from the community to help identify these\nareas and to derive appropriate solutions during the subsequent study.\n\nThe flood model developed during this study will provide Council with a valuable tool to assess the\nfuture development in the catchment.\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all public drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Indicative information on drainage asset performance for various storm events;</li>\n<li>A property database including surveyed floor levels, flood levels and the resulting floor level\nimmunity, expressed in the magnitude of a storm event;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood behaviour due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>",

Sydney Harbour is an important port and recreational region for the city of Sydney. Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "From 20 October 2023, COVID-19 datasets will no longer be updated.\nDetailed information is available in the fortnightly NSW Respiratory Surveillance Report:  https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/reports.aspx.\nLatest national COVID-19 spread, vaccination and treatment metrics are available on the Australian Government Health website:  https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/reporting?language=und\nCOVID-19 cases by likely source of infection. Publication of some data in this dataset has been suppressed (before 9 March 2020) or is being delayed because the risk of gaining information about an individual in the dataset increases as the number of cases decreases.\nThis dataset has been discontinued from 19 November 2021. NSW Health now reports daily COVID-19 cases as a total of local and overseas cases. With quarantine-free international travel, overseas origin of cases can no longer be determined immediately, but will be included in the NSW Health COVID-19 weekly surveillance reports.\nThe data is for confirmed COVID-19 cases only based on location of usual residence, not necessarily where the virus was contracted. The case definition of a confirmed case is a person who tests positive to a validated specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test or has the virus identified by electron microscopy or viral culture, at a reference laboratory. Data reported at 8pm daily.\nCase counts reported by NSW Health for a particular notification date may vary over time due to ongoing investigations and the outcome of cases under review thus this dataset and any historical data contained within is subject to change on a daily basis.\nThe underlying dataset was assessed to measure the risk of identifying an individual and the level of sensitivity of the information gained if it was known that an individual was in the dataset. The dataset was then treated to mitigate these risks, including suppressing and aggregating data. ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth and reported smoking tobacco in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and reported smoking in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, divided by the total number of females who gave birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nSmoking refers to the use of cigarettes or inhaled tobacco.\n\n\nData excludes mothers whose smoking status was not stated.\n\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is self-reported smoking of tobacco.\n\n\nBecause of differences in definitions and methods used for data collection, care must be taken when comparing across jursidictions.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Overview  \r\n This technical report estimates the responsiveness of demand for structural pine to changes in timber and steel prices. Measures of demand responsiveness can provide valuable insights into the potential implications of changes in policy or market settings on volumes and prices received by producers. The analysis focuses on estimating short-term price elasticities of demand--a formal measure of the sensitivity of demand--to changes in prices in the same quarter or recent past. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n The estimates in this report suggest that the importance of timber and steel prices on the quantity of structural timber demanded in the short-run is limited. However, the volume of residential construction activity was found to have a substantial effect for demand of domestically produced structural pine products. In particular, new house commencements explain a great deal of the quarter-on-quarter changes in the quantity of domestic structural pine sales. This confirms the common assertion by industry that house commencements are the primary driver for structural timber demand within Australia. \r\n\r\n Looking forward, changes in consumer preferences, socio-demographic trends and building regulations will likely play a much greater role in the choice of building materials used in housing construction compared with timber and steel prices. Trends suggest consumers are placing more weight on the environmental benefits of structural materials. Changing architectural styles will change the material requirements for a standard home. A global trend towards higher-density living will likely promote a shift toward multi-unit buildings, with recent changes to the National Construction Code opening the way for increased timber use in the midrise construction market, leading to greater timber use in multi-level buildings. \r\n",

The consular mission's dataset was digitized in 2012 from the library of imagery held within Geoscience Australia (GA). Image resolution ranged from 0.15m to 2.5m. The first version of the database presented a combination of known consulates, embassies and high commission located within mainland Australia. It was released on the GA Website in December 2012. In March 2015, the consular mission’s dataset was reviewed by GA. Embassies and high commissions were to be removed from this dataset and were to be presented in a separate database. In May 2015, the consulates dataset was validated against the latest information available from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) website dated 4 May 2015.\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-02-15\n",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated rice</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "The New South Wales Mooring Sub-Facility is part of the Australian National Mooring Network. \n\nThis sub-facility is establishing a transect of moorings and measurements off Sydney, which includes the Port Hacking (Sydney) National Reference Station (NRS). Like the NRS sites at Maria and Rottnest Islands, data has been collected for over 70 years at Port Hacking. The transect consists of three moorings in 65, 100 and 140m of water off Bondi and a mooring in 100m at the Port Hacking NRS, where monthly biogeochemical water sampling is conducted. This region is typically downstream of where the East Australian Current (EAC) separates from the coast, and is often influenced by EAC eddies. Data collection supports research on the marine ecosystems associated with these eddies and, as the sub-facility is located in the most densely populated area of Australia, issues such as water quality, waste disposal, shipping hazards, harmful algal blooms and recreation are also of particular research interest.\n\nThe sub-facility has also deployed two moorings across the shelf at Coffs Harbour in the north of NSW, and a pair of moorings at the Bateman's Marine Park, off Narooma in the south. These moorings will enhance the ANMN coverage along the coast of south-eastern Australia and also provide long term monitoring of the continental shelf region both upstream and downstream of the EAC separation point.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps\">riverine flooding</a> in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nSee some <a href=\"https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information\">frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding</a>.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1. Is provided for information purposes only for members of the public.\n 2. Has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses.\n 3. Is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which:\n   - May involve unstable and/or unpredictable variables and is therefore limited in its accuracy and applicability; and,\n   - Will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.\n\n 4. Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n 5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n 6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n\nAccordingly:\n\n 1. While the information presented on this website attempts to represent what may be experienced during a flood, actual flood events may differ substantially.\n\n 2. This website does not provide a forecast or prediction of future flood events or advice or warnings about floods that may occur in the future or their extent or impact.\n\n 3. Any use, reliance, interpretation, copying or reproduction of any information available on this website is at your sole risk and responsibility.\n\n 4. Without limited the previous sentence, to the extent that you use information found on this website to inform insurance or property ownership decisions about a particular property, you do so at your sole risk.\n\n\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory, its agents, officers and employees:\n\n 1.

Accept no responsibility or liability (including without limitation, liability in negligence) for all expenses, loss, damages (including indirect or consequential loss) and costs arising from the use (or misuse) or, or reliance on, the information from this service.\n\n\nThis data shows the level of flooding that can be expected during a major flood event. It identifies which areas may be flooded and the probable depth and relative hazard of the water, right down to individual blocks.\n\n\nThis feature service is derived from flood extent model by removing null cells which are less than 6 sqm in size for display purpose in the ACTmapi's Flood Map.\n\n\nImportant notice\n\nThe riverine flood map information on this website is provided for information purposes only for members of the public. It has been compiled by the Australian Capital Territory using available resources at the time of production derived from the best available modelling of the catchments and watercourses. It is subject to the uncertainties of scientific and technical research which depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to: type of flooding, intensity, frequency and duration of rainfall experienced, time of flooding, weather factors including catchment soil moisture content, new building development and changes to or unforeseen factors associated with water management infrastructure.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the sheep (September joining) model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from a E-W transect, running from Long Beach in the east, to Huskisson in the west. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On the day of sampling 7 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nTwo resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "The National Reef Monitoring Network brings together shallow reef surveys conducted around Australia into a centralised database. The IMOS National Reef Monitoring Network sub-Facility collates, cleans, stores and makes this data rapidly available from contributors including: Reef Life Survey, Parks Australia, Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia), Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (South Australia), Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales), Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service and Parks Victoria.\n\nThe data provided by the National Reef Monitoring Network contributes to establishing and supporting national marine baselines, and assisting with the management of Commonwealth and State marine reserves. \n\nReef Life Survey (RLS) and the Australian Temperate Reef Network (ATRC) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources by coordinating surveys of rocky and coral reefs using scientific methods, with the ultimate goal to improve coastal stewardship. Our activities depend on the skills of marine scientists, experienced and motivated recreational SCUBA divers, partnerships with management agencies and university researchers, and active input from the ATRC partners and RLS Advisory Committee.\n\nRLS and ATRC data are freely available to the public for non-profit purposes, so not only managers, but also groups such as local dive clubs or schools may use these data to look at changes over time in their own local reefs. By making data freely available and through public outputs, RLS and ATRC aims to raise broader community awareness of the status of Australia's marine biodiversity and associated conservation issues.\n\nThis dataset contains records of cryptobenthic fishes collected by RLS and ATRC divers and partners along 50m transects on shallow rocky and coral reefs using standard methods. Abundance information is available for all species recorded within quantitative survey limits (50 x 1 m swathes either side of the transect line, each distinguished as a 'Block'), with divers searching the reef surface (including cracks) carefully for hidden fishes. These observations are recorded concurrently with the macroinvertebrate observations and together make up the 'Method 2' component of the surveys. For this method, typically one 'Block' is completed per 50 m transect for the program ATRC and 2 blocks are completed for RLS - although exceptions to this rule exist.\n\nThis dataset supersedes the RLS specific \"Reef Life Survey (RLS): Cryptic Fish\" collection that was available at https://catalogue-rls.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?uuid=6a56db3f-d1b2-438d-98c6-bd7dd540a4d5 (provision of data was stopped in June 2021).",

    "description": "The 2014 15 Budget is officially available at [budget.gov.au](http://budget.gov.au \"budget.gov.au\") as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2014 15 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* Selected Tables from the Budget Papers – Available after Budget Papers published on budget.gov.au (~7.30pm Budget night).\r\n* Machine Readable Tables from Budget Papers – Available after Budget Papers published on budget.gov.au (~7.30pm Budget night).\r\n* The Portfolio Budget Statement Excel spreadsheets – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night).\r\n* A Machine Readable CSV of all PBS Excel Spreadsheet Line Items – Available after PBSs tabled in the Senate and translated (~8.30pm Budget night). First version published with 10 portfolios ~8:50pm Budget night. Work due to be competed by midday 14 May 2014.\r\n\r\nData from the 2014-15 Budget are provided to assist those who wish to analyse, visualise and programmatically access the 2014-15 Budget. It is the first time this has been done as per [our announcement blog post] (http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2014/04/24/budget-2014-in-data-form \"Budget 2014 in data form blog post\"). We intend to move further down the digital by default route to make the 2015-16 Budget more accessible and reusable in data form. We welcome your feedback and comments below.  Data users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury. \r\n\r\nInformation about the PBS Excel files and CSV\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes. Only the line item data (table 2.2) is available in CSV at this stage as we thought this would be the most useful PBS data to extract. Much of the other data is also available in the Budget Papers 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Agency Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Agency 2014-15 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.2: Programme Expenses and Programme Components.\r\n* Table 3.1.1: Movement of Administered Funds Between Years;\r\n* Table 3.1.2: Estimates of Special Account Flows and Balances;\r\n* Table 3.1.3: Australian Government Indigenous Expenditure (AGIE);\r\n* Tables 3.2.1 to 3.2.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.2.7 to 3.2.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the csv file ‘2014-15 PBS line items dataset’ was prepared from individual agency programme expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: estimates of general government expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1).  Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.      Intra agency charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements; \r\n\r\n2.      Agency expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n\r\n3.       Additional  agencies’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only agencies that are directly government funded are required to prepare a PBS.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the following Portfolios have contributed their PBS Excel files and are included in the line item CSV: 1.1 Agriculture Portfolio; 1.2 Attorney-General’s Portfolio; 1.3 Communications Portfolio; 1.4A Defence Portfolio; 1.4B Defence Portfolio (Department of Veterans’ Affairs); 1.5 Education Portfolio; 1.6 Employment Portfolio; 1.7 Environment Portfolio; 1.8 Finance Portfolio; 1.9 Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio; 1.10 Health Portfolio; 1.11 Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio; 1.12 Industry Portfolio; 1.13 Infrastructure and Regional Development Portfolio; 1.14 Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio; 1.15A Social Services Portfolio; 1.15B Social Services Portfolio (Department of Human Services); 1.16 Treasury Portfolio; 1.17A Department of the House of Representatives; 1.17B Department of the Senate; 1.17C Department of Parliamentary Services; and 1.17D Department of the Parliamentary Budget Office.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by agency and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV as these can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required. If a corrigendum to an agencies PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary. \r\n\r\nBelow is the CSV structure of the line item CSV. The data transformation is expected to be complete by midday 14 May, so we have put up the incomplete CSV which will be updated as additional PBSs are transformed into data form. Please keep refreshing for now.\r\n\r\nPortfolio, Department/Agency, Outcome, Program, Expense type, Appropriation type, Description, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, Source document, Source table, URL\r\n\r\nBudget Paper Tables\r\n--------------------------\r\nWe have made a number of data tables from Budget Papers 1 and 4 available in their original format as Excel or XML files.

    "description": "This dataset contains a false color aerial image mosaic of the City of Melbourne municipal area. False color images render the scene in other colors not seen by the human eye. It is used for the interpretation of natural resources. \n\nThe red tone of the aerial image is associated with live vegetation. Intense reds indicate vegetation which is growing vigorously and quite dense. This image is contains embedded georeferenced information.\n\nCapture Information:\n- Capture Date: 2nd/3rd February 2019\n- Capture Pixel Size: 5cm\n- Map Projection: MGA Zone 55 (MGA55)\n\nAdditional technical information:\nArborCarbon collected high resolution multispectral imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. ArborCarbon have used this multispectral image to create this seamless 20cm false-colour composite showing variation in vegetation condition.\n\nThe multispectral imagery was acquired at 8,000ft above ground level over the City of Melbourne under cloudless conditions between 09:45 and 12:45 on 2nd and 3rd February 2019. \n\nImagery was acquired with the ArborCam system with a ground sample distance ranging from 6 cm/pixel to 25 cm/pixel dependent on the band. Imagery was comprised of 3 broad bands in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and an additional 7 narrow-bands strategically positioned in the visible and near infra-red regions to detect subtle variations and changes in vegetation condition.\nPreview Image:\nSee an example image showing the data quality of the aerial.\n\nDownload TIF: \nDownload file (2GB)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of employed ophthalmologists and full-time equivalent (FTE) per 100,000 population. The data spans the year of 2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWD). The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), in conjunction with the national health professional registration boards, is responsible for the national registration process for 14 health professions. The data from the annual registration process, together with data from a workforce survey that is voluntarily completed at the time of registration, form the Department of Health’s National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWDS). Data in the NHWDS includes demographic and employment information (for example, labour force status, location of main job, area of practice, work setting) for registered health professionals. In this report, the data on optometrists and ophthalmologists comes from the NHWDS as reported by AIHW.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nFTE is a measure calculated by dividing an estimate of the total hours worked by employees in an occupation in a week by an estimate of the standard hours worked for optometrists (38 hours per week). The number of FTE is then compared with the size of relevant population to get the FTE 100,000 population.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n",

    "title": "TRIAP Franklin 2008 Waterbirds",
    "description": "1) As part of the Tropical Rivers Inventory and Assessment Project (TRIAP), a database of 94,148 waterbird records was assembled, comprising 82,596 records from the TRIAP area and 11,552 records from a surrounding 10 km buffer. These records were sourced from databases for Atlas1 and Atlas2 provided by Birds Australia, 99.1% of which are from the Historical Atlas (pre-1977), the first Field Atlas (1977-1981) or the second Field Atlas (1997-2002).\r\n2) Waterbirds were defined to include species of freshwater and coastal wetlands including in-shore but not off-shore marine species. The TRIAP waterbird fauna comprises 145 species from twenty families, of which 112 species are represented in the database by more than ten records.\r\n3) One TRIAP waterbird species – the Australian Painted Snipe – is listed as threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). Eighty-seven species are listed as \"migratory\" under the EPBCA, 44 species are listed under the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement and 53 species under the China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement. The geographical characteristics of all listed species are summarised for the TRIAP area.\r\n4) In the TRIAP area, the Australian Painted Snipe is an infrequent visitor or perhaps rare resident found more frequently in the more arid south. Its preferred habitat of ephemeral wetlands with a mix of mud-flats and dense low vegetation does not closely match habitats recorded for the species in the TRIAP area, which may reflect the marginal nature of its occurrence in this area. Breeding records in the TRIAP area have been in flooded grasslands.\r\n5) A foraging guild classification based on a classification of foraging substrate, foraging methods and food types is presented in this dataset. Twelve foraging guilds are recognised as occurring in the TRIAP area.\r\n6) No waterbirds are endemic to the TRIAP area. However, the TRIAP area represents a major proportion of the range of the Chestnut Rail, and a major proportion of the Australian range of the Great-billed Heron.\r\n7) A biogeographic classification of TRIAP waterbirds is developed based on breeding distributions. Four classes are recognised: a. species for whom TRIAP is a core breeding area; b. Australasian species for whom TRIAP is marginal to their main distribution; c. Palaearctic / Nearctic migrants – these do not breed in Australia; and d. Non-migratory species with a distribution centre in Asia, or Malaysia including New Guinea. Few species other than vagrants have restricted ranges within the TRIAP area, but there is a weak declining gradient in species richness from east to west.\r\n8) The distribution of waterbird families, foraging guilds and threatened species were compared qualitatively with a 1:250 000 classification of waterbodies into seven units. Although the results are \"noisy\", groups associated with deep water and saline habitats were clearly identifiable. A geomorphic classification of rivers provides only linear data and poor spatial correspondence with waterbird records. Neither classification provides a direct measure of the wetland features most relevant to most species, and whilst quantitative analysis could be pursued, it appears unlikely to identify many definitive habitat relationships.\r\nSee Table 6, section 3.3 of (Franklin 2008) for an explanation of foraging guilds. Note that \"herbivore\" includes the possibility of also being extensively insectivorous, whereas \"insectivore\" implies that herbivory is not a major component of the diet.\r\nSee lineage for more details or refer to: \r\nFranklin DC. 2008.

    "description": "With this proposal we ask time to continue our timing follow-up campaign of pulsars discovered with the MeerKAT telescope. Fourtytwo sources have been discovered in targeted observations of Fermi unidentified point sources, two towards Supernova Remnants, 19 in the Magellanic Clouds, 105 in Globular Clusters and 81 in a survey of the Galactic plane. A large fraction of the new discoveries are recycled pulsars (including a few relativistic systems and several 'spider' binaries), or young pulsars. Timing observations have an essential role in exploiting the full potential of any pulsar discovery, allowing for the precise measurement of rotational, astrometric and orbital parameters which, in turn, give us powerful tools to improve our understanding of the physics in extreme environments as well as of the population of neutron stars as a whole. The UWL receiver of the Parkes telescope is a sensitive, versatile instrument that is allowing us to successfully time these new sources, in the bright-end of TRAPUM discoveries.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n 1.

    "description": "This dataset presents the statistics of hospitalisations with a principal diagnosis associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) excluding principal diagnosis of dialysis distributed by sex for the years between 2012-2015. The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

The Fund is expended in line with provisions within the Act and is administered by the Office for Design and Architecture SA within the Department for Trade and Investment.\nThe Fund enables the South Australian Government to adopt a state-wide approach to strategically implement open space and public realm projects. While supporting the Minister for Planning to acquire, manage and develop land for open space, the Fund provides grant funding opportunities for local government through the Open Space Grant Program.\nOpen Space Grant Program\nAccess to quality public open space continues to be increasingly important to ensure South Australia remains liveable, healthy and sustainable, particularly in the context of increasing residential infill in existing neighbourhoods. During the Grant Program opening period, councils are encouraged to apply for grants, to assist with the purchase and enhancement of public open space, accessible to the community.\nThe purpose of this data is to show the location of Planning and Development Fund investment.

    "description": "    \n\nFactor Most Limiting Yield (acidity/sodicity/salinity) dataset is one of 11\nnational surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic\nopportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in\n1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a06.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

The Faust Capel Basins survey GA-2436/ TAN0713 was acquired by Geoscience Australia onboard the RV Tangaroa (operated by NIWA) from the 6th of October to the 22nd of November 2007. The geographic range stretched from Wellington to the Faust Capel Basins to Lord Howe Island and back to Wellington. Approximately 8,945 sailing km of multibeam bathymetry was acquired. The high resolution bathymetry data imaged seafloor features in unprecedented detail, revealing the effects of recent magmatic activity and fluid migration on the seafloor. It also produced a new image of a flat topped unexplored seamount. A member of the Lord Howe Rise seamount chain.\n\nThis dataset is not to be used for navigational purposes.",

    "description": "The overall aim of this project was to determine the geomorphological and sedimentary characteristics (biological and physical) of the Ningaloo Reef and shelf, and to identify evolutionary characteristics relevant to the maintenance of marine biodiversity. This included characterising reef growth history, coastal and seabed geomorphology, surficial sediment facies and their influence on the distribution of benthic habitats. This research presents an interdisciplinary study that provides an important baseline for future habitat mapping, biodiversity assessments, spatial planning, and fisheries management. The characterisation and mapping of benthic habitats based on physical parameters is central for the ongoing monitoring, management and conservation of the NMP’s inshore and offshore resources, particularly during a time of increasing anthropogenic and environmental pressures.",

    "description": "Wetlands are a crucial part of the natural environment. Wetlands provide breeding and feeding habitat for waterbirds, fish, invertebrates and plants. Wetlands may be natural, or human made. The water in a wetland can be still or flowing, and can be fresh, brackish or saline. \n\nThe WSP Prescribed Wetlands for unregulated river water sharing plans (Inland NSW) have been identified by the department as being suitable for listing under water sharing plans to protect their water from future extraction above currently permitted levels. \n\nThe wetlands include those that are recognised under the International Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar), areas that form part of a listing on the Directory of Important Wetlands of Australia (DIWA) or have been identified as receiving protections under a prior water sharing plan. Wetlands identified within Floodplain Management Plan Management Zones D or SP may be added following further consultation with affected stakeholders.  \n\nThis data generates an interactive map of wetlands (including lakes and billabongs), considered significant for the purposes of new water supply works and trade rules in inland unregulated water sharing plans. In NSW, all surface and groundwater is managed under water sharing plans (WSPs). WSPs cover large catchments and are subordinate to the Water Management Act 2000. A WSP has rules which can help to protect identified wetlands. \n\nThe wetlands were identified through a method developed by the NSW government in 2023 and refined in 2025. The method is not intended to identify all wetlands in a catchment. \n\nThe types of wetlands in this data set are those which have been previously assessed as important and/or have a water body that is persistent for at least 3 to 4 months following inundation.  \n\nThis data asset can be used by landholders, conservationists and others to understand the location of wetlands subject to WSP rules, including rules to restrict construction of new water supply works and trades. The spatial data asset complements relevant pdf maps of such wetlands for remade individual inland river unregulated WSPs (available on DCCEEW Department website). \n\nPLEASE NOTE: In the case of any discrepancy between this digital dataset and the published Water Sharing Plan (accessible on the www.legislation.nsw.gov.au site) the instrument as made by the Minister remains the authoritative source and should be used to both interpret the intent of the Plan and in subsequent decision making. Best endeavours have been made in collating relevant Water Sharing Plan boundary and attribution contained in this dataset. However, no warranty is provided as to the accuracy or currency of this representation. The department does not warrant and is not liable for the use of this material as per the licenced sharing conditions CC-BY 4.0. \n\nThis dataset does not include the separate “Significant Wetlands” data set initially used for six other water sharing plans replaced in 2024. The “Significant Wetlands” layer is intended to be reviewed, updated, renamed and eventually added to this WSP Prescribed Wetlands data set to make a single comprehensive WSP Prescribed Wetlands layer for all inland unregulated water sharing plan areas. At that time, the “Significant Wetlands” layer will become redundant. \n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

    "description": "This stochastic climate dataset relates to the <strong>Lachlan</strong> region.\n\nThe stochastic data are 10,000-year daily data sets of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration generated using observed data sets combined with palaeo-logical climate data. This work has been undertaken by researchers at University of Adelaide and University of Newcastle and used in Regional Water Strategies.\n\nThe climate for each climate variable is uploaded as a single ZIP file, which includes three files:\n<ol>\n<li>a .csv file of daily climate data of 10,000 years (format: date, data; filename starts with station ID)</li>\n<li>a pdf file of the meta data of the climate data describing the geographic location of the climate station, data type, period of observed data used for generating stochastic data, a location map.</li>\n<li>a pdf file of the quality assurance information.</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe climate variables include one or more of the following: rainfall, evapotranspiration (Mwet: Morton’s wet area potential evapotranspiration, Mlake: Morton’s lake evaporation, Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (FAO56)), Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature. \n\nNote: Among the available ZIP files listed below, you will find one large “All Stations Full Package” ZIP that contains every station’s dataset in a single complete package, as well as many smaller ZIP files, each containing the data for an individual station only.\n\nNote: Within each ZIP file, the number seen within the filename i.e.  9093_SILO_Rain.zip represents the Station ID Number 59093.",

    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2014.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "description": "The operational map McKies Stringybark/Blackbutt Open Forest (MSBOF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) reviewed the determination for MSBOF and agreed upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification. These parameters included the presence of lateritic soils and the characteristic eucalypt species Eucalyptus mckieana and Eucalyptus andrewsii.  Using these diagnostic parameters, we assessed whether MSBOF is present within more than 150 000 hectares of state forests within the Upper and Lower North East IFOA areas of the Nandewar and New England Bioregions. We began the assessment process by examining the distribution of Eucalyptus mckieana records in NSW Bionet and other available systematic plot data characterising regional vegetation patterns. We then used the results of a recently completed vegetation mapping in the region (OEH, 2015) to provide an indicative map of related vegetation communities within State Forests. From this initial investigation, we identified three state forests as candidate areas for MSBOF within the Project Study area – Mount Topper, New Valley and Clive State Forests. We collected systematic plot data from these state forests in mapped communities related to the TEC and from within stands of vegetation dominated by the primary eucalypt species described in the determination.\nOn this basis we identified four plots within Mount Topper State Forest as being MSBOF TEC and went on to construct an operational map at a scale commensurate with the needs of forestry field operations. In total, we mapped a total of 201 hectares of MSBOF, 101 hectares of which were contained in the IFOA area.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

    "title": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) still images - Caswell Sub-basin, Browse Basin Marine Survey (GA0345/GA0346/TAN1411)",
    "description": "Geoscience Australia (GA) conducted a marine survey (GA0345/GA0346/TAN1411) of the north-eastern Browse Basin (Caswell Sub-basin) between 9 October and 9 November 2014 to acquire seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the basin. The survey, undertaken as part of the Department of Industry and Science's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP), aimed to identify and characterise indicators of natural hydrocarbon or fluid seepage that may indicate compromised seal integrity in the region. \n\nThe survey was conducted in three legs aboard the New Zealand research vessel RV Tangaroa, and included scientists and technical staff from GA, the NZ National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research Ltd. (NIWA) and Fugro Survey Pty Ltd. Shipboard data (survey ID GA0345) collected included multibeam sonar bathymetry and backscatter over 12 areas (A1, A2, A3, A4, A6b, A7, A8, B1, C1, C2b, F1, M1) totalling 455 km2 in water depths ranging from 90 - 430 m, and 611 km of sub-bottom profile lines. Seabed samples were collected from 48 stations and included 99 Smith-McIntyre grabs and 41 piston cores. An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) (survey ID GA0346) collected higher-resolution multibeam sonar bathymetry and backscatter data, totalling 7.7 km2, along with 71 line km of side scan sonar, underwater camera and sub-bottom profile data. Twenty two Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) missions collected 31 hours of underwater video, 657 still images, eight grabs and one core. \n\nThis catalogue entry refers to Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) still image data acquired during survey GA0345/GA0346/TAN1411.\n\nFollowing mapping with the shipboard multibeam, higher-resolution multibeam data were acquired in targeted areas using a Kongsberg Simrad EM2000 system mounted to the Fugro Echo Surveyor V (ES-5) AUV. This instrument had a depth rating of 3000 m, and surveyed the seafloor according to a pre-programmed mission plan. The AUV was fitted with a camera and light system designed to produce images of equal width and height (in the context of this survey, the images comprised 8 m by 8 m of seafloor). The equipment consisted of a light sensitive NEO 11 Megapixel 35 mm monochrome CCD (4008 x 2672) camera and two LED panels, each comprising 360 LEDs. High-resolution multibeam bathymetric data was collected together with side scan sonar and sub bottom profile data at an elevation of 30 m above the seafloor, and at line spacing's of 100 m. Overlapping high-resolution still photographs (captured every second) were then acquired on the survey lines at an elevation of 8 m above the seafloor. The AUV was equipped with an advanced real-time Aided Inertial Navigation System, which calculated the position, velocity and altitude of the vehicle and a HiPAP 500 USBL system was used to acoustically position the AUV.\n\nUnderwater imagery was collected from two AUV missions in study Areas 3 and 4. During the 2nd AUV mission on 22 October, the vehicle encountered an obstruction on the seabed and became trapped despite commencing an emergency ascent sequence. The AUV was subsequently recovered from the seabed during salvage operations incorporated into the ROV phase of survey operations. \nA total of 24 877 still images were acquired in Area 3 and 20 743 in Area 4 over 58 and 56 line kilometres, respectively. Still images (.jpg files) are located in folder 'TAN1411_AUV_STILLS' with sub-folders named according to gear code (AUV= Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), mission and study Area (e.g. AUV_M2_A3 = still images acquired during AUV mission 2 in Area 3). USBL (Ultra-short baseline) text files (`TileCam.idx) are located in each sub-folder and provide continuous navigational information on location, time (UTC) and depth of AUV still imagery transect lines.",

    "title": "IMOS - ACORN - South Australia Gulfs HF ocean radar site (South Australia, Australia)",
    "description": "The South Australia Gulfs (SAG) HF ocean radar system covers the area of about 40,000 square kilometres bounded by Kangaroo Island to the east and the Eyre Peninsula to the north.  This is a dynamic region where warm water from the remnants of the Leeuwin current is moving from the west, and water with varying density is exchanging with Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St Vincent.  Upwelling events occur from the deep ocean on the south side of the observation area.  This is a key ocean area for aquaculture and fishing, and is a major shipping thoroughfare.  The data from this HF ocean radar system link the dynamics of the Great Australian Bight to the Bonney Coast and on to Tasmania. \n\nSpecific research questions identified by the SA Node of IMOS are: What is the detailed connection between shelf currents and the Flinders Current to non-regional influences (e.g. Southern Ocean, WA)?  What is the nature of oceanic currents and processes (e.g. wave drift, mixing, eddies) that drive both winter and summer cross and along shelf exchange including the summertime upwelling systems and flushing of the gulfs?  How does the ocean circulation, wave drift, eddies and environmental variability affect the distribution of sediments, nutrients, the production of lower trophic levels\n(phytoplankton and zooplankton), the dispersal of larvae that underpin productive fisheries in the region and the effects of environment on aquaculture\n\nThe SAG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Cape Wiles (34.943 S, 135.681 E) and Cape Spencer (35.294 S, 136.879 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated.  \n\nMost of the capital was contributed by the South Australia Research and Development Institute.",

    "description": "These tables present a summary of employment under the Public Service Act 1999 at 31 December 2012 and during the 2012 calendar year. The data is an update of that presented in the APS Statistical Bulletin 2011-12.\r\nData becomes available at six monthly intervals — through this summary for calendar year data and through the annual State of the Service Report (SOSR) and APS Statistical Bulletin (the Bulletin). The data in these tables is sourced from the APS Employment Database (APSED), which contains data extracted from agencies’ HR systems.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Public Service Commission continues to work with agencies to improve the quality and timeliness of the data they provide to APSED. Each year extensive audits and error checking of APSED are undertaken, to ensure that sound conclusions can be drawn from the data. Through this audit process, previously published data has been updated. The June 2012 data published in SOSR and the Bulletin has been revised.\r\n\r\nAs in the Bulletin, a headcount approach is used in these tables—that is, people working part-time are aggregated with people working full-time without weighting. Data also includes inoperative staff. Employees’ classification in these tables refers to their base or substantive classification. Abbreviations used in these tables and changes to administrative arrangements for the period July to December 2012 are explained in the link below. The Explanatory Notes at Appendix 1 of the Bulletin provide definitions of terms used in these tables.\r\nThe Bulletin is available at http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-apsc/parliamentary/aps-statistical-bulletin/snapshots-december-2012",

This table of historical data has been compiled as far as possible on an AAS basis, and from 2004-05 onwards, is consistent with the AASB 1049 cash flow statement presentation.  The data from 1997-98 include the transactions of government schools and arts institutions on a gross operating basis, as well as the full trading operations of TAFE institutes and hospitals, nursing homes and ambulances. Although this expanded coverage does not materially influence the net operating result for the general government sector, it does significantly increase the inflows and outflows presented in the cash flow statement.

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nAustralia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0, an update of  Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013), is a continental dataset which identifies forested and non-forested land over which Indigenous Australians have legislated use and rights. \r\n\r\n The Indigenous use and rights information was sourced from multiple Indigenous land ownership, land management and land rights datasets from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies. The forest cover (National Forest Inventory forest types) information was derived from the Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 dataset, an update of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset. \r\n\r\n The update was necessary in order to align the forest cover types of the Forests of Australia 2013 dataset with those reported in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013) and also to introduce an attribute containing forest category information into the dataset. The update had no impact on the Indigenous land management categories reported by the Australia's Indigenous forest estate dataset, and minimal impact on the area of forest types reported against each land management category. \r\n\r\n\tThe  Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0 dataset provides both Indigenous use and rights and forest type information for forested lands, and Indigenous use and rights information only for non-forested lands. \r\n\r\n\tThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for use in the National Indigenous Forestry Strategy (NIFS) and SOFR 2013. The dataset, compiled for use at the national scale, identifies four nationally consistent Indigenous estate categories which indicate the degree of management control that Indigenous people have over both forested and non-forested land. The categories are: 1.\tIndigenous owned and managed; \r\n2.\tIndigenous managed; \r\n3.\tIndigenous co-managed; and \r\n4.\tOther Special rights. \r\n These categories align with the reporting requirements for the NIFS and SOFR and meet the requirements of the data suppliers.

    "description": "The Eastern Treatment Plant (ETP) receives sewage from the eastern side of Melbourne. This file describes the quality of the sewage received by providing results of regular sampling.\n\nThe sample is taken with a flow-weighted auto-sampler. Samples are collected at 7:00 AM each day and relate to the previous 24 hours (e.g. timestamp of 5/1/19 07:00 was sampled between 4/1/19 07:00 and 5/1/19 07:00). Results are in milligrams per litre (mg/L). To calculate an incoming load in raw sewage, match this with wastewater inlet hourly flow for the same time period (as noted in the example).\n\n\n\nQuality parameters include: Ammonia (Ammonia as N) (mg/L), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) (mg/L), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (mg/L), Nitrate plus Nitrite (mg/L), Nitrogen (Nitrogen (total)) (mg/L).\n\n\n\nNOTE.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1988. For each day of sampling three resources are provided in the compressed (zipped) folder: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "The Bioregional Profile identifies a number of ecological features that are of conservation value because of the role they play in the environment of the South-west Marine Region. Key ecological features meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\n1. a species, group of species, or a community with a regionally important ecological role (e.g. a predator, prey that affects a large biomass or number of other marine species);\n\n2. a species, group of species, or a community that is nationally or regionally important for biodiversity;\n\n3. an area or habitat that is nationally or regionally important for: \na) enhanced or high productivity (such as predictable upwellings - an upwelling occurs when cold nutrient-rich waters from the bottom of the ocean rise to the surface);\nb) aggregations of marine life (such as feeding, resting, breeding or nursery areas);\nc) biodiversity and endemism (species which only occur in a specific area); or\n\n4. a unique seafloor feature, with known or presumed ecological properties of regional significance.\n\n\nKey ecological features have been identified by the Australian Government on the basis of advice from scientists about the ecological processes and characteristics of the area. A workshop held in Perth in September 2006 also contributed to this scientific advice and helped to underpin the identification of key ecological features.\n\nSixteen KEFs have been identified in the South-west Marine Region:\n\n1. Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Houtman Abrolhos Islands \n2. Perth Canyon and adjacent shelf break, and other west coast canyons \n3. Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to the west coast inshore lagoons \n4. Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to Geographe Bay \n5. Cape Mentelle upwelling \n6. Naturaliste Plateau\n7. Diamantina Fracture Zone\n8. Albany Canyons group and adjacent shelf break \n9. Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Recherche Archipelago\n10. Ancient coastline at 90-120 m depth\n11. Kangaroo Island Pool, canyons and adjacent shelf break, and Eyre Peninsula upwellings.\n12. Meso-scale eddies (points).\n13. Western demersal slope and associated fish communities.\n14. Western rock lobster.\n15. Benthic invertebrate communities of the eastern Great Australian Bight. No spatial representation available.\n16. Small pelagic fish of the South-west Marine Region. No spatial representation available.\n\n \nIn order to create a spatial representation of KEFs for the South-west Marine Region, some interpretation of the information was required. DSEWPaC has made every effort to use the best available spatial information, and best judgement on how to spatially represent the features based on the scientific advice provided. This does not preclude others from making their own interpretation of available information.Departmental Deed\nData is available on request.\nNone",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the WA public sector report 2015 - Creating opportunities is the public sector entity survey (PSES). \r\n\r\nThe 2015 PSES collected information across topics such as the application of Commissioner’s Instruction No. 7 – Code of Ethics, codes of conduct and general principles of human resource management, public interest disclosure, equal employment opportunity strategies and agency management at June 2015 or for the 2014/15 financial year. The survey was sent to chief executive officers and chief employees of public sector entities with over 20 full-time equivalents as at December 2014, including Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state. In 2015, 84 public sector entities completed the survey. \r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2015.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant entities to access online.\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2015 data.xls – individual agency responses to the PSES with a question key and response key. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2015 data.sav – individual agency responses to the PSES, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of PSES data is available in the State of the WA public sector statistical bulletin 2015. \r\n",

    "description": "This dataset should be read alongside other energy consumption datasets on the City of Melbourne open data platform as well as the following report:\n\n\n\nhttp://imap.vic.gov.au/uploads/Meeting%20Agendas/2014%20August/Att%207a_IMAP_Energy_Map_-<em>CSIRO</em>-<em>Energy_Use_2011-2026_Report</em>-<em>2014June30</em>-Final_pdf_11.2MB.pdf\n\n\n\nThe dataset outlines modelled energy consumption across the City of Melbourne municipality. It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

    "title": "East Hills Stormwater Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located within the Sydney suburb of East Hills. The study area is a small\nurban catchment centred on the East Hills Railway station, which drains through a\nstormwater pipe network to the Georges River. Much of the study area is also affected by\nflooding from the Georges River, where a series of blockwall “finger levees” have been\nconstructed to reduce flood velocities and the hazard experienced to the occupants of\nriverfront dwellings. The catchment is wholly within the Bankstown local government area.\n\nReport Structure\n\nThis report is divided into two parts. The first part provides background on the study and\nfurther discussion of the available data, modelling approach and results from the flood model\nthat was established to analyse flooding within the catchment. The second part is a technical\nreport that provides additional detail concerning the flood model, model results and flood\nmapping, which is included as an appendix.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nOutcomes from this study include:\n(i) a database of all drainage assets within the study area;\n(ii) establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;\n(iii) information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions; and\n(iv) a model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development\nproposals.\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll data collected for the study has been included within a GIS database. This allows the\ndata to be spatially represented across the study area and allows for easy retrieval of the\ndata as required. Information in the database includes data for some 88 stormwater pits and\n83 stormwater drainage pipelines.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints\nand the terrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also represented in the database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour,\nusing the computer program known as TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the\nmodel through a 2-dimensional grid covering the entire study area. The stormwater pipe\nnetwork is included as 1-dimensional elements within this grid.\n\nFull details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other assumptions are\nincluded in the Flood Model Report, which is included in Appendix A.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively\nfrequent events to more extreme floods, under existing (2007) catchment conditions.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels,\nflood depths and flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing\ncontours of equal flood heights throughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and\ncan be overlaid on base mapping such as aerial photos and cadastral plans showing\nproperty boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS\ncomputer system. Much of this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in\nAppendix A.\n\nIt is intended to develop a database of properties that are at risk of being affected by\nflooding as part of the floodplain management study, which is the next phase of the\ninvestigations. This will define the problem areas within the catchment and allow an\nassessment of potential flood mitigation options.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 4. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1011R4.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, February 20, 2011\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, February 26, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rate of overnight admitted mental health-related separations and bed days, with and without specialised psychiatric care by patient location. Overnight admitted patient separations refers to those separations when a patient undergoes a hospital’s formal admission process, completes an episode of care, is in hospital for more than one day and ‘separates’ from the hospital. The data spans the financial year of 2015-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collections in Australian hospitals. It includes demographic, administrative and length of stay data for each hospital separation. Clinical information such as diagnoses, procedures undergone and external causes of injury and poisoning are also recorded.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRates are directly age-standardised.\n\n\nThe analysis of bed days presented in this table excludes those separations with a length of stay greater than 365 days.\n\n\nSeparations with a care type of Newborn (without qualified days), and records for Hospital boarders and Posthumous organ procurement have been excluded.\n\n\nIt is possible for patients to have multiple separations in any given reference period.\n\n",

    "description": "We propose a modest program to continue monitoring 4 of the 6 known radio magnetars in order to achieve three primary science goals. The first is to characterise magnetar outbursts over long timescales, for which tracking their rotational, flux density, and polarisation properties provide a clear view of the impulse response of their magnetic fields. Second, understanding the links between magnetars the mysterious fast radio burst phenomenon through the discovery of rare emission and propagation effects, shared spectro-temporal phenomenology, and connections to high-energy (X-ray/gamma-ray) phenomena. Lastly, our continued monitoring has enormous benefit to the wider magnetar community, providing rapid alerts to changes in activity, adding context to unusual behaviour detected by high-enery observations, and a host of supplementary science through the teams extensive collaborative networks. The project and its precursors have been running since 2007 and have contributed to 21 publications since then. We are seeking to convert the project to long-term status, thereby also carrying these investigations into the SKA era.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2008 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "The full-time apparent retention rate (ARR) measures the proportion of a cohort of full-time students that moves from one grade to the next, based on an expected rate of progression of one grade per year. It does not track individual students through their final years of secondary schooling.\nData Notes:\n\n\nThe ARR is the ratio of the total number of full-time school students in a designated year (e.g. Year 12 in 2020) divided by the total number of full-time students in a previous year (e.g. Year 7 in 2015). This would be the Year 7 to 12 apparent retention rate in 2020.\n\n\nFrom 2020, students in mainstream support classes (previously excluded from this data) are reported by their underlying grade of enrolment.  As a result, data from 2020 onwards is not directly comparable to previous years.  A separate column in the CSV files has been provided to show the 2020 retention rates with both previous and revised counting rules. 2021 retention rates use the revised counting rules.\n\n\nSupport students at Schools for specific purposes (SSPs) do not have a designated grade and therefore are not counted in the calculation of ARRs. Support students in mainstream schools have been included in the calculations from 2020 (see above). \n\n\nReporting on ARRs based on small numbers of students can lead to unreliable ARR estimates. The tables combine ABS SA4 areas to ensure the underlying number of students is sufficiently large to generate reliable estimates.\n\n\nOnly full-time students are counted in the calculation of full-time apparent retention. Part-time students are excluded.\n\n\nStudents enrolled in distance education classes are included with their appropriate grade levels. Sydney-Inner includes enrolments from Sydney Distance Education High School.\n\n\nARRs can exceed 100 per cent due to factors including student migration from interstate and overseas and between school sectors.\n\n\nNorfolk Island Central School is not included in the Apparent Retention Rate factsheet, but from 2018 to 2021 was included under NSW Government data in the ABS Schools Australia publication. This can lead to a slight difference in reported figures between Schools Australia and this dataset.\n\n\nAboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander students are identified based on responses to the school enrolment form. This information may change throughout an individual’s schooling.\n\n\nReporting by non-binary gender is not possible due to system limitations.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nApparent Retention Rate Factsheet. \nEducation Statistics and Measurement, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

The distinguishing factor is that a S19 can only exist by Ministerial approval and Gazettal and although a S19 can be created over any land it can never co-exist with private land or mining tenure. The primary purpose of a S19 is to provide a 24-month period for the interested party to organise the reserving or leasing of the area but a S19 can also be created for other reasons subject to the Minister or his delegate being satisfied it is warranted. There is provision that the Minister, or his delegate, may vary, cancel and extend the term of a S19 for a period or periods (not exceeding 2 years at a time) and this is commonly done. Any creation, variation or cancellation of a S19 must be published in the Government Gazette. The S19 will expire if is not extended.  Prior to 14 October 1995 S19s were created with an indefinite term and can only be removed by having the Minister cancel the S19.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in BreastScreen Australia for women ages 50 to 74, by age group. The national breast cancer screening program, BreastScreen Australia began in 1991. It aims to reduce illness and death from breast cancer using screening mammography for early detection of unsuspected breast cancer in women. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of women in the population aged 50-74 screened by BreastScreen Australia over 2 calendar years. The population denominator was the average of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for females aged 50-74 within the relevant geographical area for the relevant 2-year reporting period.\n\n\nA PHN was assigned to women using a postcode to PHN correspondence. Because these are based only on postcode, these data will be less accurate than those published by individual states and territories.\n\n\nSome postcodes (and hence women) cannot be attributed to a PHN and therefore these women were excluded from the analysis. This is most noticeable in the Northern Territory but affects all states and territories to some degree.\n\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n\nThe time period of some PHN data presented is prior to the initiation of PHNs, which were in established in June 2015.\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia changed its target age group from 50-69 years to 50-74 years from July 2013; participation is reported for both the previous and current target age groups to allow comparison of trends with previously reported data.\n\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change.\n\n\nThe 2014-2015 period covers 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, and the the 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016.\n\n\nPHN205 Murray includes Albury, NSW\n\n",

    "description": "A basemap image service that displays the best openly available (latest and highest spatial resolution) authoritative general reference imagery datasets captured by remotely piloted aircraft systems (drones), piloted aircraft, and satellite space craft over areas of Queensland. This basemap service is designed to provide access to the latest publicly available State Remotely Sensed Image Library collection of aerial imagery capture under the Spatial Imagery Services Program (SISP). Aerial imagery that is three years or older captured under SISP is made available for public use openly by the Department of Resources, Queensland. Satellite imagery (Planet Q3 2017 mosaic) is visible in areas over Queensland where aerial photography is unavailable. Basemap services comprise a single layer of static imagery optimised for display purposes. This service has a tile cache built down to a scale of 1:1129. The tile cache can be turned off in client software for viewing at lower scales and printing purposes, and can be used in dynamic mode to filter and display individual project areas. The projects range from 2cm to 240cm resolution. Accuracy is dependent on the individual projects. Periodical updates will be made to the service as new projects are captured. Projects are visible at scales 1:50,000, 1:250,000 and 1:25000000. The images comprised in each of the projects are orthorectified which removes the effects of image perspective (tilt) and relief (terrain) effects for the purpose of creating a planimetrically correct image. The resultant orthorectified images have a constant scale wherein features are represented in their 'true' positions. If you would like to receive updates for new projects, functionality or planned downtime please subscribe here: http://ems.gs/3qln0iYbIYQ.",

    "description": "Traditional pulsar searching techniques are not sensitive enough to extreme pulsars such as millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in compact binaries (e.g., Pulsar-Blackhole binary systems), extremely fast spinning pulsars (e.g., sub-MSPs), and high dispersion measure (DM) pulsars. Such a situation is now changed thanks to the development of next generation radio telescope arrays such as Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). ASKAP is capable of conducting highly sensitive radio continuum surveys with wide sky coverage (e.g, Evolutionary Map of The Universe survey). One of the solutions is to find pulsar candidates in radio continuum surveys such as ASKAP surveys and then carry out targeted searches. This technique allows us to search over the wide bandwidth with full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. In this proposal, we propose to observe 16 pulsar candidates identified in the Galactic plane using new ASKAP EMU images. We found 22 candidates by selecting sources with spectral index steeper than -2.0 and compactness less than 1.2. Among them 13 are known pulsars and a reasonable number of candidates to follow up (9 sources). In total, we have 16 candidates including seven sources from 2023APRS semester. Because of the dense ionised medium in the Galactic Plane, MSPs are likely to be missed by previous pulsar surveys carried out at 1.4 GHz. Here, we propose a targeted pulsar search with the Parkes UWL which allow us to search pulsation at higher frequencies and therefore avoid strong DM smearing and scattering effects.",

This dataset contains reports, data and metadata used in the flood study, and results data for the existing floodplain condition scenarios.  \n\nCouncil is committed to ensuring we have the latest flood modelling data to help manage flood risk in Brisbane. Flood studies provide Council with technical data to inform policy and for managing flooding within the Brisbane River and local creek and overland flow catchments.  \n\nThe Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study comprises a series of 27 individual sub-models which cover the entire Brisbane City Council area. Results data for flood height, depth and hazard (depth x velocity) are available for each individual sub-model for the 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) storm events.   \n\nFor specific details on how the study was conducted, the areas it covers, and before using the data please read the flood study report. The flood study report, metadata used in the flood study and a detailed map that shows the 27 individual sub-models has also been made available in open data and is called <a href=\"https://data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/explore/dataset/flood-study-citywide-overland-flow-reference\">Flood Study — Citywide Overland Flow — reference</a>.  \n\nThe data on the table tab is the metadata relating to the data used for flood modelling in the Brisbane City Council Citywide Creek and Overland Flow Path Mapping Flood Study.   \n\nMore information on flood studies and how this information is used can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-safety/community-safety/disasters-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-brisbane/flood-strategy/flood-studies\">Brisbane City Council Website</a>.\nThe image below shows the 27 individual sub-models of the flood study and can be used to identify the sub-model for your location of interest.\n\n  ",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are overweight or obese. Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30, or obese if their BMI was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",
