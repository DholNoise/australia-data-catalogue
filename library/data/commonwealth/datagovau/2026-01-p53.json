The policy and guidelines do not apply to noise from existing railways or major roads in the vicinity of an existing noise-sensitive land use, or an increase in traffic along an existing railway or major road in the absence of a major redevelopment.\n\nIt is expected that a review of the operation and effectiveness of the policy would be conducted within two years of the commencement of the policy.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to the leading causes of death by sex. The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any SA4 with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who have a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally for all first births, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who had a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally, divided by the number of females who gave birth vaginally, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2013-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nBirths included are vaginal births, including non-instrumental and instrumental births.\n\n\nBirths excluded are caesarean sections.\n\n\nThird-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in second-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal sphincter, rectrovaginal septum, and sphincter not otherwise specified. Excludes laceration involving the anal or rectal mucosa. A fourth-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in third-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal mucosa and rectal mucosa.\n\n\nFor multiple births, the perineal status after the birth of the first-born baby was used.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset shows mature tree crown polygons across Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) derived from 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model. Mature Tree crowns are defined as those larger than 100m2 canopy footprint, and higher than 8 metres tall. Includes native and non-native tree representation and estimates height. Also see <a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1c62bf7c475748afb1ca5b1ae2239afd\">Mature Tree Centre Points.</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Methods:</strong>\nThe canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. Tree crowns were delineated using a one metre 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model (CHM) via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynn 2004; Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020).A 3X3 low pass smoothing algorithm was applied to the CHM raster. The CHM was then loaded into R and manipulated using the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020). A variable window filter, which was used in parallel with watershed segmentation, was applied to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The following metrics was used for the variable window:function(x){((x^2)* 0.009 + 2.5)}. A minimum height of 3 metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The watershed segmentation method was implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting segmented raster was converted to a simplified polygon layer, and joined with the treetops point layer. Polygons smaller than 3 square metres were removed. Tree crown polygons larger than 100m2 and higher than 8 metres were filtered as &quot;mature trees&quot;. Dataset represents native and non-native species.\n\n\n\n<b>Tree Crown Delineation Method</b>\nThe inverse watershed delineation (IWD) method is the popular technique for segmenting individual tree crowns using LIDAR data (Marcu, et al., 2017) (Wannassiri, et al., 2013). LiDAR-based IWD methods have been successfully applied in conifer-dominated systems, while broadleaf-dominated systems have proven to be more challenging (Hastings, et al., 2020). A common problem with the IWD method is the overestimation of tree crowns, especially in dense tree stands. This problem can be partially overcome by a) aggressively filtering the data, and b) using a variable window filter (VWF) algorithm to detect dominant treetops, which then feeds into the IWD.\nIn this project, 2015 and 2020 tree crowns were delineated from the respective CHM’s, via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynne, 2004) implemented via the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel, 2021). The R-code used in this project is included in metadata lineage.\nA variable window filter was applied within the ForestTools package to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a variable moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, and the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The derivation of the appropriate window size to search for treetops is based on the assumption that there is a relationship between the height of the trees and their crown size. The higher the trees, the larger the crown size.\nVarious functions were tested to define the window search radius, including simple linear functions. The function described by Popescu &amp; Wynne was eventually chosen to inform the window search radius of the tree top detection algorithm, as it achieved the best results for mature trees.\nA minimum height of three metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The IWD method was then implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting raster dataset contained unique identifies corresponding with the tree tops point dataset. The ensuing segmented rasters were converted to polygon layers and joined with the treetops point layers.\n\n<b>Delineated Tree Crown Model Validation</b>\nMap products produced by remote sensing analysis typically uses ‘ground truth’ to determine accuracy. In practice, accuracy assessments evaluate the remote sensing-derived map product relative to some higher quality determination of the map. These higher quality data, referred to as ‘reference data’, is compared to the map product using statistical sampling (Stehman, 2009).\nValidation of the 2015 mature tree crown polygons was done by randomly selecting 40 points from the dataset and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons (digitized from 2015 aerial photography). The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 32 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 8 of the reference polygons. The overestimation of the canopy projective area by the delineation model can be partly attributed to the low pass filter that was used to smooth the canopy height model during the delineation process, which effectively added pixels to the perimeter of tree crowns in the CHM.\nA similar process was followed to validate the 2020 mature tree crown model, using the same 40 randomly selected points and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons from 2020 aerial photography. The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 33 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 7 of the reference polygons.\nAlso see\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2f277dfd24964ef3943d99b34c38ebad\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 1m - Districts - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2eb04c29f971499aa3aebe4abaa36059\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 Statistics - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li></ul>\n\nReferences:\nPlowright, A &amp; J Roussel.

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "title": "Native Vegetation Management Benefits - Series 2",
    "description": "Native Vegetation Management Benefits (NVMB) mapping\n\nNVMB mapping is a way of identifying the relative benefits to NSW biodiversity of protecting or restoring native vegetation. NVMB mapping is used for cross-tenure, whole-of-landscape conservation planning, decision support, prioritisation and scenario planning.\n\nThe NVMB method employs well-developed ecological theory to combine vascular plant records, bioclimatic data, vegetation condition mapping and connectivity analysis. \n\nNVMB Series 2\n\nSeries 2 is a fully complementary set of NVMB layers with consistent units (with a range from zero to one), such that for any location, the set of benefit values across the set of NVMB layers sum to a single maximum level of overall potential benefit for that location, referred to as the 'Maximum Biodiversity Benefit' (MBB). MBB reflects each location's capacity to support species and communities which have been depleted across NSW. The schema describing the nesting of the set of layers is provided in the attached resource: <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-benefits-series-2/resource/b3ba42d1-318e-4c6e-995b-ab8181049293\">NVMB Series2 chart</a>. Two 'delta' (change) layers are included to represent what additional benefits can be achieved in 15 years of fostering regeneration (delta improve benefits) and through full restoration action (delta restore benefits). A 'manage and improve' layer quantifies the combined benefits conserved by managing existing vegetation, and the additional benefits that can accrue through fostering regeneration (over a nominal 15-year period). \n\nAll layers are derived from a common set of inputs. The various NVMB layers become differentiated through the application of variants of the <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/ecological-condition-of-terrestrial-habitat\">ecological condition</a> layer, at the final stage of developing the layers (current condition is used for manage benefits, partially restored condition for improve benefits, and fully restored condition for the restoration benefits).\n\nSeries 2 represents a slight but significant departure from previous NVMB versions. Previous versions were provided in 4 separate SEED records:  Manage benefits; Improve benefits; Restore benefits; and Landscape benefits. The landscape value benefits from the previous version are now integrated into Manage, Improve and Restoration benefits. A new layer of Maximum Biodiversity Benefit is added.\n\nEnd users will notice significant differences between previous versions and these Series 2 layers. Stage 2 puts greater emphasis on cross-scale ecological connectivity across the benefit layers rather than treating landscape connectivity separately. For example, cleared areas of highly diminished communities such as box-woodlands in the wheat-sheep belt, are only given the highest restore benefit value in areas that are also well connected to areas of existing native vegetation.\n\nVersioning\n\nSeries 2 is an update on the previous NVMB series (Series 1). Users may wish to employ Series 1 in cases where connectivity considerations are less (e.g., for large scale conservation actions - which produce their own 'critical mass'). In most cases Series 2 is the preferred source for conservation planning.\n\nDue to the Series 2 layers forming an integrated set, they are provided together in a single SEED record. Because of the step change from previous version, Series 2 is reset as Series 2 v1.0. \n\nSeries 2 v1.0 is relevant to 2017. It does not consider the 2019-20 megafires or the degree of subsequent recovery. However, 2017 and 2020 NVMB surfaces have been produced in Series 1 (see below for more information).\n\nMore technical detail\n\nThe probabilistic method used for accumulating values draws on the 'equitable' approach (Drielsma and Love 2021) which applies 'diminishing returns' to connectivity, rather than the previous 'any additional unit of connectivity always provides proportionally more benefit'.\n\nThis series also incorporates the following advances:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nuse of continuous values in GDM/environmental space (i.e., no loss of information by unnecessarily reducing to discrete classes)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nby incorporating an improved connectivity links approach (Drielsma et al. 2022), the new layers better consider how different locations can contribute to maintaining or restoring habitat linkages that allow species to move and migrate across landscapes \n</li>\n<li>\n\nincorporation of generic REMP approach (Drielsma and Love 2021) for spatial context component\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nMore information\n\nSeries 1\n\nThe previous series of LVMB mapping can be found at the following SEED records:  <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-manage-benefits9c71e\">Manage benefits</a>; <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-improve-benefitsaaf8c\">Improve benefits</a>;  <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-revegetate-benefits1d347\">Restore benefits</a>; <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm-landscape-value-mapping-benefitsbb846\">Landscape benefits</a>.\n\nPost-megafires\n\n2017 and 2020 (post-megafire) NVMB surfaces have been produced in Series 1, for <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm---manage-benefits9c71e\">manage</a> and <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-management-nvm---revegetate-benefits1d347\">restore</a>. If comparing between 2017 and 2020 be sure to use outputs from the same series (i.e., series 1).\n\nClimate-informed NVMB\n\nClimate-informed versions of the manage benefits and restore benefits (Series 1 v.1) can be found <a href=\"https://iar.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset/data-packages-for-the-biodiversity-impacts-and-adaptation-project\">here</a>.

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover spatial datasets, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. State and Territory agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to the states' and territories' data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\nForests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and the Regional Forests Agreement Act 2002. The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

The data is current as at 31 Dec 2021, includes quarterly snapshots beginning from Dec 2019, and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) 2016.  The geographical boundaries are sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) website.\nThe National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is an independent statutory agency. Their role is to implement the NDIS, which will support a better life for hundreds of thousands of Australians with a significant and permanent disability and their families and carers.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit the NDIA.\nPlease note:\n\n\nThe State/Territory groupings are based on the participant's latest residential address.\n\n\nThe availability status of each SA4 is based on the mapping between the SA4, NDIA Service Districts and the bilateral agreements to determine phase-in date for each SA4.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised the participant data.

Here we map Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCE) for PNG using Earth observation data for 2020. This research project aimed to evaluate Living Earth for obtaining consistent and quantified information on blue carbon ecosystem states and dynamics. The objectives focused on evaluating a) the transferability of the existing infrastructure to other big data platforms and to a new geography or ecosystem of interest, namely the tropical coastal environments of Papua New Guinea, and b) the translatability of algorithms for extracting environmental descriptors from EO data between countries and regions and constructing comparable classifications of and uncertainty metrics associated with the mapped land covers and changes. For all coastal regions of Papua New Guinea, and using the CSIRO EASI ASIA ODC instance, classifications and linked descriptions of land cover were successfully generated, with these including BCEs and some terrestrial land covers.

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\nNB This NSW layer is only _NISB.shp, not _NISB_PLUS.shp.",

Area is not the principal basis for determining the predominant use. The predominant use may be determined and applied during the construction phase of a structure and will be identified by its ultimate land use code followed by a secondary land use code of 01.\n\nRating category definitions are used to determine the rating of properties across Brisbane City Council.\n\nRating category definitions are contained in the Resolution of Rates and Charges which is the formal resolution that sets out the various rates levied by Council and any associated charges.\n\nResolution of rates and charges tables are used in identifying the rating categories and charges for rateable properties across Brisbane City Council for the financial year.\n\nInformation in this dataset relating to land use code definitions or relating to rating category definitions must be read in conjunction with the Resolution of Rates and Charges section of the <em>Annual Plan and Budget 2018-19</em>.

The echosounder's nominal frequency is 12 kHz.\nData are stored in *.all raw format for bathymetry and backscatter at CSIRO. There are 87 files totaling 2.97 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.all format are corrected for motion and position.\nTide corrections were not applied to the processed data. Processed data had outliers removed. Processed line data are available in *.gsf and ascii format, and processed bathymetry and backscatter grids in geotiff format.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nThis dataset, created in June 2013, provides an indication of the likelihood of a flood occurring from storm tide inside the Brisbane City Council local government area. This layer contributes to the storm tide Flood Awareness Map.\n\nStorm tide flooding happens when a storm surge creates higher than normal sea levels. A storm surge can occur due to a low atmospheric pressure meteorological system and/or strong on-shore winds force sea levels to rise above normal levels among other reasons. Flooding can also occur from king tides. King tides occur throughout the year and are higher than normal tides. Low lying parts of Brisbane and the Bayside suburbs may experience storm tide flooding. Tide affected areas of the river, tidal creeks and other waterways may also be affected.\n\nThere are four different storm tide flooding likelihood areas in Flood Awareness Map, namely High, Medium, Low and very low.\n\nThe storm tide High likelihood layer consists of the current 5% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) (20 year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI)) (2.1mAHD) storm tide flood extent.\n\nThe storm tide Medium likelihood layer consists of the current 1% AEP / 100 year ARI (2.5mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high likelihood area). \n\nThe storm tide Low likelihood layer consists of the 0.2% AEP / 500 year ARI (2.85mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high and medium likelihood areas). \n\nThe storm tide Very Low likelihood consists of the 0.05% AEP / 2000 year ARI (3.2mAHD) storm tide flood extent (outside high, medium and low likelihood areas).",

    "title": "Australian honey bee industry: 2014-15 survey results",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n ABARES has produced a report containing the results of analysis of beekeeping financial and physical performance data collected from beekeeping businesses in 2015-16. Key performance measures for beekeeping businesses are presented, including analysis of pollination services, use of public lands, challenges facing the beekeeping industry and the extent to which research and information is sought and implemented. \r\n\r\n The report draws on data from the ABARES Australian Honey Bee Industry Survey conducted in 2016. It provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing the current situation of Australian beekeeping businesses, as well as monitoring changes from previous surveys conducted in 2002 and 2008. \r\n\r\n The survey was funded by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, as part of the Australian Government's response to a recommendation from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report from 2014 on the future of the beekeeping and pollination service industries in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n• Over 13,000 registered beekeepers operate across Australia. The number of commercial beekeepers fell by 25 per cent over the 10 years to 2015-16. \r\n• Most honey produced came from non-agricultural private land (39 per cent) or public land (39 per cent). 23 per cent was produced from agricultural land. Larger businesses were more likely to derive a greater proportion of total honey produced from public land. \r\n• The majority of beekeeping cash receipts came from honey sales (85 per cent) in 2014-15. Cash receipts from paid pollination were the second largest component of receipts (11 per cent). Business cash income averaged $70 400 and was significantly higher in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. \r\n• Small operators had negative business profit and rate of return in 2014-15, while small-medium, medium and large operators experienced increasingly large positive rates of return and business profit. \r\n• Paid pollination was conducted by around 44 per cent of beekeepers in 2014-15. The proportion of beekeepers and the value of payments received were higher in areas that produced large amounts of bee-pollination dependent crops such as almonds and cherries. \r\n• Drought was the most commonly cited challenge to honey production by beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 (70 per cent of beekeepers). Half of beekeeping businesses indicated that the use of agricultural chemicals negatively impacted floral resources available and thus their honey production. \r\n• The most common disease and pest affecting beekeepers over the 5 years ending 2014-15 were chalkbrood and the small hive beetle. The greatest financial impacts were caused by the small hive beetle and American foulbrood. \r\n• Nearly three quarters of beekeeping businesses changed their management practices in 2014-15 as a result of research. Large businesses were more responsive to research findings than smaller operators. \r\n",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the south central section of Jervis Bay between 10/07/90 and 30/08/90. This 'Red' mooring (35.0872 S, 150.7333 E) held three S4 Interocean current meters at various depths (18.5m, 10.5m and 6.5m). \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals.  \n\nThe data provided in all these datasets includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings.\n\n**Unfortunately two datasets are missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 6.5m have not been located, as neither have the 10min sample readings for the meter at 10.5m**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This dataset presents regional surface hydrological in-land waterbodies in Australia as polygons which describe the area of the body of water at a higher resolution than that of the national dataset.  \nThe following features are included in this dataset:Canal Area - An artificial open channel which provides the supply, distribution or removal of water for irrigation purposes, or for a significant infrastructure function (such as salt interception, land reclamation, or drainage between water features for environmental management purposes). Estuary - The part of the mouth or lower course of a river in which its current meets the sea's tides, and is subject to their effects. Swimming Pool - An artificial body of water intended for swimming or water-based recreation, situated either above or in-ground. Flood Irrigation Storage - A body of water collected and stored behind constructed barriers, for the specific use of flooding pastures via internal irrigation systems. Town Water Storage - A body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier for some specific use (with the exception of Flood Irrigation Storage). Town Water Storage are bodies of water primarily stored for the consumption of urban, semi urban and rural township populations. The water is treated post storage by government, or private authorities, and connected to government regulated water networks. Rural Water Storage - A body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier for some specific use. Rural Water Storage are bodies of water stored for rural farming and agricultural practices (with the exception of Flood Irrigation Storage) and/or for the consumption of the associated land owners. The water is not treated by government authorities or connected to government regulated water networks. Lake - A naturally occurring body of mainly static water surrounded by land. Watercourse Area - A natural channel along which water may flow from time to time. Aquaculture Area - Shallow beds, usually segmented by constructed walls, for the use of aquaculture. Salt Evaporator - A flat area, usually segmented, used for the commercial production of salt by evaporation. Settling Pond - Shallow beds, usually segmented by constructed walls, for the treatment of sewage or other wastes. Swamp - Land which is so saturated with water that it is not suitable for agricultural or pastoral use and presents a barrier to free passage. Marine Swamp - That low lying part of the backshore area of tidal waters, usually immediately behind saline coastal flat, which maintains a high salt water content, and is covered with characteristic thick grasses and reed growths. Foreshore Flat - That part of the seabed or estuarine areas, between mean high water and the line of lowest astronomical tide. Saline Coastal Flat - That nearly level tract of land between mean high water and the line of the highest astronomical tide.Land Subject to Inundation - Low lying land usually adjacent to lakes or watercourses, which is regularly covered with flood water for short periods.\nFor more information please visit the Geoscience Australia Web Service Portal.\nPlease note: \n\nThis dataset is a snapshot of Geoscience Australia's web service dataset as on 2019-03-12\n",

You must not set down or pick up passengers in clearways, even when stopped at traffic lights or in traffic.\n\nClearways are also tow away zones. Any vehicle parked in a clearway will be towed as soon as possible. Towed vehicles will also be issued with a parking fine.\n\nSome clearway areas operate only during certain times of the day. The clearway sign will show the times of operation. If there are no times on the sign, the clearway applies 24 hours a day.\n\nAdditional information on parking can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/parking-in-brisbane\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.

The primary compartment boundaries for WA were determined by identifying major changes in rock type along the coast and changes in shoreline orientation, while incorporating complete landforms of coastal significance. The primary compartments have then been subdivided to produce secondary and tertiary compartments. This dataset was commissioned by the Department of Planning and compiled by Damara Pty Ltd and the Geological Society of WA. A full report was also prepared to accompany the dataset , published August 2011.

The base data used for the capture is the cadastre. The Suburbs layer is a data set that reflects the official boundaries of addressable localities in South Australia as defined by the Geographical Names Act, 1991. The polygons are based on the existing cadastral, topographic or road centerline data that defines the underlying features that boundaries follow.\nThe Suburb Boundaries in the urban and rural areas are updated when required through notification in the Government Gazette or spatial improvement of the cadastre. The capturing started 1990 and is ongoing. The Suburb boundary dataset is currently 100% complete for the state and complies with government classification standards.\nFor more information please visit the South Australian Government Data Portal.",

Visit our Spatial Applications Support page (https://spatial-qld-support.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/QSUITE/pages/1067515932/Cadastre+and+Address+Modernisation+CAM) for more information.The Digital Cadastre is the spatial representation of every current parcel of land in Queensland, and its legal Lot on Plan description and relevant attributes. It provides the map base for systems dealing with land-related information. The Digital Cadastre is considered to be the point of truth for the graphical representation of property boundaries. It is not the point of truth for the legal property boundary or related attribute information, this will always be the plan of survey or the related titling information and administrative data sets.

Fully immunised means a child has received the scheduled vaccinations according to age for hepatitis B (hepB); diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (DTPa); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); polio (IPV); pneumococcal, meningococcal C, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), and varicella. The data spans the years of 2012-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data was sourced from the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), which is administered by the Australian Government Department of Human Services. The AIR is a national register that records immunisations given to children to help parents and guardians keep track of their children’s immunisations.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Immunisation rates for children in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe AIR may underestimate coverage due to incomplete submission of immunisation records or the inclusion of children who no longer reside in an area but have not been updated on the register.\n\n\nChildren identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander in this report reflect the indigenous status recorded on the AIR, which is based on Medicare enrolment records.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"NP\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nRows assigned a \"#\" in the \"Interpret with Caution\" column should be interpreted with caution as these area’s eligible population is between 26 and 100 registered children.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2011 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Median rents represent the midpoint in the distribution of all rents. Fifty per cent of rents are higher than the median and fifty per cent are below the median.\nThe Rental Report provides the most accurate information on the private rental market in Victoria. The data come from records kept by the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority (RTBA). The RTBA is responsible for receiving, registering and refunding all bonds associated with private residential leases in Victoria.\nFor more information please visit the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of criminal incidents by principal offence recorded on the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP). A recorded criminal incident is a criminal event that may include multiple offences, alleged offenders and/or victims that is recorded on the LEAP database on a single date and at one location. The data spans the years ending March in the period of 2010 to 2019 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe CSA recorded crime collection includes all offences that are reported to, and detected by, Victoria Police and recorded on the LEAP database. The scope and coverage of the data, however, is not representative of all crime that occurs in Victoria. Some crimes may not be recorded on LEAP, not be reported to police, or the responsibility for responding to certain offences may lie with another agency. Recorded criminal incident data are compiled on the basis of the date that the incident was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the incident was detected by, or reported to police. The creation date may not be the date when the incident occurred, or the date when the incident came to the attention of police.\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nRecorded crime statistics are based on data extracted by Victoria police on the 18th day after the reference period, and are subject to movement between releases.\n\n\nThe criminal incidents in the dataset are grouped according to the CSA offence classification.\n\n\nThe data excludes criminal incidents recorded at Justice institutions and immigration facilities, Unincorporated Victoria and where the geographic location is unknown or outside of Victoria.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, sensitive criminal incident counts for subdivisions 'A10 Homicide and related offences' and 'A30 Sexual offences' with a value of 1 to 3 are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n",

It is a summary measure of the ongoing sustainability of operations. It excludes gains and losses resulting from changes in price levels and other changes in the volume of assets. It is the component of the change in net worth that is due to transactions and can be attributed directly to government policies.\nThe general government sector comprises all government departments, offices and other bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. General government services include those which are mainly non-market in nature, those which are largely for collective consumption by the community and those which involve the transfer or redistribution of income.",

This dataset contains the inputs of the UNION as follows:\n\n\n\nA:\n\n\n\nA 20km buffer around the mine point locations for\n\n\n\nAirly (underground)\n\nAngus Place -(underground)\n\nAppin (underground)\n\nClarence (underground)\n\nCullen Valley (underground)\n\nDendrobium (underground)\n\nInvincible (open cut)\n\nPine Dale (open cut)\n\nRussell Vale (underground)\n\nSpringvale (underground)\n\nTahmoor (underground)\n\nWest Cliffe (underground)\n\nWongawilli (underground)\n\n\n\nthat has been clipped to the Sydney Basin bioregion boundary.\n\n\n\nand;\n\n\n\nB: \n\n\n\nA 500m buffer around selected 1:250k Topo streamlines flowing out of the underground mine areas, they being\n\n\n\nAngus Place - (Wolgan River)\n\nAirly - (unnamed)\n\nCullen Valley (unnamed)\n\nSpringvale - (unnamed)\n\nClarence - (Wallangambe River)\n\nAppin/West Cliffe - (Georges River)\n\nDendrobium - (Cordeaux River)\n\nRussell Vale (Cataract River)\n\nTahmoor - (unnamed)\n\nWongawilli - (unnamed)\n\n\n\nThe 20km mine buffer takes in most of the buffered stream areas with the exception of the eastern most sections of the Wolgan and Warrangambe, thus resulting in the snakelike extrusions in the north eastern part of the PAE shapefile and another extending northwest from Cullen Valley beyond the bioregion boundary.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) SSB Preliminary Assessment Extent inputs v01.

The data at any given time is a combination of information provided from a number of original sources up to 2015, some administrative maintenance, and edits provided through self-management.\nThe original data was collected by Dr Darren Phillips and published in 1996 in paper form. There were various state and city lists maintained as HTML lists by Russ Grayson and Fiona Campbell on the ACFCGN website from 2004-2014. During this period other partial directories were created, including the Tasmanian inventory of school Gardens (~2008), the South Australian Eat Well program (~2010), and the listings of Cultivating Community in the Melbourne area (~2011). These and other lists were combined for the first time in a single database in 2012 by John Brisbin. In 2018 ACFCGN was offered support from AURIN (Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network) to upgrade the database and annual survey to allow for better access by academics and other researchers.\nFor further information please contact data@communitygarden.org.au (+61 407 471 565)",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 – 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980’s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ‘non-targeted’ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ‘grazers’  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index.. An index (1-25) calculated by multiplying our visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (Complexity 1-5). These values are estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect. 5 transects per site = 25 SCI estimates per site. The e-atlas data we have provided is site means… i.e.. the mean of those 25 values. \r\n- LCC - Live coral cover (percent cover), live hard and soft coral pooled.\r\n- LHC - Live hard coral cover (%), live hard coral only.  \r\n- MAC - Macro Algae Cover % (fleshy algas only, does not include turf algae)\r\n- Fish Line_SUM - is the pooled number of lines recorded on the 5 transects surveyed at each site. = total number of lines/1500m2.\r\n- Line Accumulation Rate - number of lines accumulated per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.\tWilliamson D.H., Ceccarelli D.M., Evans, R.D., Jones, G.P., Russ, G.R.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "A 6m galvanized pole has been deployed in the eastern part of the lagoon in behind Seabird Islet. \n\nThe Relay Pole has three functions. The first is to propagate the wireless network through which the buoys talk and so it forms part of the network backbone talking directly to Relay-Pole 1. The second function is that a vaisala WXT520 weather station is mounted on the top and so this pole provides above water met observations. These include air temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction and rainfall.\n\nThe third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex.\n\nThe pole has two Campbell Scientific loggers (one for the weather station, one for the sensors), spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station). The sensor string as of August 2010 has a SeaBird SBE37 at the end of the sensor string (around 230m out from the pole), and two SeaBird SBE39's located at teh reef crest and down at the start of the reef slope.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

This dataset only shows the classifications and trends from the 2004 and 2008 assessment. \n\nThe Assessment focused on colour, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total dissolved salts, total suspended solids and turbidity. A total of 255 sites from 23 basins in Western Australia (out of a total of 44) were included in the 2008 update with 126 of these being assessed for the first time in 2008. In 2004 232 sites were assessed. Due to a lack of data numerous sites that were assessed in 2004 are not included in the 2008 update. Many basins had no data, whilst the others lacked recent monitoring data. The status and trend results were compiled into an excel spreadsheet.\n\nDataset was formerly known as Statewide River Water Quality Assessment (DOW-056)",

    "description": "This web service contains sediment and geochemistry information for the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in the Timor Sea collected by Geoscience Australia during September and October 2012 on RV Solander (survey GA0339/SOL5650).  Further information on the survey is available in the post-survey report published as Geoscience Australia Record 2013/38: Nichol, S.L., Howard, F.J.F., Kool, J., Stowar, M., Bouchet, P., Radke, L., Siwabessy, J., Przeslawski, R., Picard, K., Alvarez de Glasby, B., Colquhoun, J., Letessier, T. & Heyward, A.\nSurvey SOL5650/GA0339 was undertaken between 12 September and 6 October 2012, using the AIMS 35 m research vessel Solander with a science and technical support crew from AIMS, Geoscience Australia, University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. The survey comprised a series of geophysical mapping and biophysical sampling activities in four areas within the Oceanic Shoals CMR. In each survey area, multibeam sonar data (bathymetry and backscatter) was collected to provide 100% spatial coverage, with sampling stations selected before the survey. Site selection used a spatially-balanced random stratified method (termed a Generalised Random-Tessellation Stratified [GRTS] design), that was weighted to shallow areas (<50 m water depth). Sampling included non-destructive techniques (towed underwater video, stills photography, baited underwater video) to record benthic and pelagic biota, plus physical sampling of sediments and epibenthic biota (grabs, benthic sled tows). Water column measurements (conductivity, temperature, turbidity) and sea surface samples were also taken at representative stations and during transits. To broadly characterise the sub-surface geology, shallow (<70 m) sub-surface data was collected across three of the survey areas with a sub-bottom profiler.\nSampling was undertaken at 70 stations across the four survey areas to characterise the geophysical and biological properties of the seabed and water column within each area; with sea surface samples collected at a further nine stations during transits. At each station, the type of sampling undertaken and the gear used was determined by the seabed composition, water depth and visibility. In particular, deployment of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) was limited to water depths less than ~60 m due to high turbidity and low light conditions. \nSampling activities within the four survey areas included:\nTowed underwater video transects at 52 stations to characterise seabed types and benthic communities;\nCollection of replicate sediment samples at 61 stations for sedimentology, geochemistry and infauna analyses using either a Smith-McIntyre grab (29 stations) or a box corer (32 stations);\nBenthic sled tows at 22 stations to sample epibenthos;\nDeployment of BRUVS at 56 stations to characterise demersal fish communities;\nDeployment of Stereo Imagery System for Shark and Tuna Assessments (SISSTAs) units at 120 stations to characterise pelagic fish communities;\nDeployment of a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) instrument at 63 stations to characterise water column properties, and; \nDeployment of 10 ocean drifters to map surface ocean currents in the region.\nA link to the post-survey report is available here: http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/76658/Rec2013_038.pdf\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",
