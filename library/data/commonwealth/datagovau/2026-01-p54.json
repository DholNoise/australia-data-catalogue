    "description": "The O&A Trajectory data set includes data collected during the voyages of Australia's Marine National Facility and CSIRO marine research vessels.  Trajectory data typically consists of undulating CTD track point data.\n\nThe subset extracted for MARVL contains data on the continental shelf as defined by the 200 metre depth contour from the 2012 Bathymetric dataset merged (spatial union) with the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Australian Maritime Boundary dataset (http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_63565) available from Geosciences Australia (GA).  This subset of the data contains 867,617 position records from 14 voyages and includes water temperature, pressure, water depth, fluorescence and salinity (derived) and spans from 1995 to the present.\n\nThe full data set is held in the O&A Information & Datacentre Data Warehouse, which currently holds over 3,124,509 position records from 31 voyages collected since 1988.  This data includes water temperature, pressure, water depth, fluorescence, salinity (derived), oxygen, eco chloro, eco cdom and eco bp. Individual metadata records have been created for each research voyage.",

    "description": "    \n\nIn March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs)\nbegan reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures\nto APR in _ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures_. This return is the basis of\nthe data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\nfor its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APR ceased\nthe RFC data collection after September 2010.\n\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the [BIS Guide on\nInternational Financial Statistics\n[PDF]](http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf) (see Part II\nInternational banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other\ncountries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars.\n\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\n\nAll banks operating in Australia complete ARF 231. Between March 2003 and\nSeptember 2010, only those larger RFCs with sizeable overseas assets and/or\nliabilities completed RRF 231. Bank and RFC positions are reported in\nAustralian dollars (AUD). Non-AUD denominated positions have been converted to\nAUD using an appropriate end-quarter exchange rate, so changes in reported\ndata between quarters are due not only to changes in positions but also\nvaluation gains or losses due to exchange rate changes.\n\nThere are two sets of IBS data: _locational_ data, which are used to gauge the\nrole of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international\ncapital flows; and _consolidated_ data, which can be used to monitor the\ncountry risk exposure of national banking systems. Only locational data are\nreported in this statistical table.\n\nAll assets are reported at market value. While some liabilities are reported\nat market value, contractual or nominal values are used where market values\nare not appropriate.\n\nThe locational data reported in this statistical table are on international\nassets and liabilities, comprise loans and deposits, securities and other\nassets and liabilities _vis- -vis_ non-residents in all currencies and vis-A\n-vis residents in foreign currency. The main balance sheet items included as\nclaims (i.e. assets) are deposits and balances placed with banks, loans and\nadvances to banks and non-banks and holdings of securities. The main\nliabilities include deposits and loans received from banks and non-banks.\nReporting entitiesa own issues of securities in international markets are also\nincluded as liabilities. (See notes to statistical tables B12.1 and B12.2 for\nmore detail on the types of assets and liabilities included.)\n\naTotal banks and RFCsa is also reported in United States dollar (USD)\nequivalent amounts, using the end-quarter AUD/USD exchange rate from\nstatistical table F11.\n\n",

    "title": "Hanley’s River Snail Indicative Distribution in NSW",
    "description": "Hanley’s River Snail is a freshwater snail that was once common and\nwidespread in the Murray River catchment, including the Lachlan\nand Murrumbidgee Rivers. In the 1940s, the species was so\ncommon it supported collections of thousands of individuals for\nresearch purposes. However populations rapidly declined in the\n1960s and 1970s and by the 1980s they were reduced to a handful\nof locations, probably as a result of weir building and other activities\nassociated with river flow management. They are now virtually\nextinct throughout their natural range and living specimens have only\nbeen found from within three locations in NSW. They are a critically\nendangered species - www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/threatenedspecies/threatened-species-list/critically/hanleys-river-snail\nThe methods used to create the predicted current distribution of\nHanley’s River Snail are described fully in: NSW Department of\nPrimary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community Status 2015 – Final\nReport. \nAll available records of the species were collated and assessed for\naccuracy. For current distribution, only records after 1 January 1994\nwere used. Within the framework of the Australian Hydrological\nGeospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network, the records were\nassociated with attributes from the National Environmental Stream\nAttributes Database and River Styles® geomorphology. The\nAustralian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology\nnetwork (Geofabric) is a fully connected and directed stream network based a 9 second DEM. It allocates a unique stream segment\nnumber to each river reach in Australia. The Environmental\nAttributes Database is a set of lookup tables supplying attributes\ndescribing the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the\nstream and catchment environment that was developed by the\nAustralian National University (ANU) in 2011 and updated in 2012.\nThe data is supplied as part of the supplementary Geofabric\nproducts which is associated with the 9 second DEM derived\nstreams and the National Catchment Boundaries based on 250k\nscale stream network. 30 Stream variables were assessed for the\nmodelling.\nRiver Styles® provides a high resolution categorical classification of\nriver character within a nested hierarchy of criteria based on valley\nsetting, channel planform, geomorphic units, and bed material. The\nNSW Office of Water compiled a spatial dataset of River Styles®\nclassifications for a large number of the waterways of NSW. From 65\nRiver Style® categories we generated two new fields representing\nPlanform (34 categories) and Substratum (8 categories) for each\nstream segment. River Style® planform and substratum categories\nwere then assigned to each Geofabric segment.\nMaxEnt 3.3.3 is a widely used species distribution modelling program\nthat utilises presence records to generate probabilities of occurrence\nbased on a suite of environmental variables quantified across the\narea of interest. It was used to model the current geographic\ndistribution of each listed threatened freshwater aquatic species or\npopulation. We utilised logistic output to plot the predicted\ndistribution of each species. This output equates to a probability that\nthe species will be observed in each river reach, given the\nenvironmental conditions that exist there relative to the\nenvironmental conditions where the species is known to occur. For\nthis mapping, above 33% probability was considered predicted\npresence. Only stream segments with a modelled average daily flow\nof more than five megalitres were selected for output. In addition,\npredicted separate populations were connected by manual\ninterpretation. The predicted values for each river reach were\nconverted from the Geofabric framework to the higher resolution\n2013 NSW Strahler Stream Order Hydroline.",

Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) from small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "This point dataset shows the position and names of Recreational Areas within the State of Queensland. This dataset has been derived from the Queensland Recreation Areas (Polygon) 2016 dataset by calculating each polygon's centroid. Recreational areas include: - civic Squares, gardens, golf gourses, miscellaneous areas (e.g. basketball courts, bowling clubs, caravan parks, netball courts, tennis courts, velodromes , ovals, parks, race courses, racetracks, rifle Ranges, showgrounds, zoos). This purpose of this dataset is to provide the position and names of Recreational Areas for use in Land Administration,Topographic Mapping and in the production of Navigational and Web Based Mapping applications. Additional Information: This data has been compiled from numerous sources to produce a state wide coverage with the boundaries aligned in most cases with the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB)or captured from the best available imagery with an attribute within the data describing the source and reliability. Source data include: Queensland digital cadastral database, Queensland regional mapping, Queensland orthophotography, satellite imagery, Geoscience Australia, community and government websites. The horizontal positional accuracy of the data that has been used to compile this dataset is as follows: Orthophotography +/- 1m, Satellite Imagery +/- 2.5m. The horizontal positional accuracy of DCDB is dependent on the accuracy of the DCDB at the time of extraction.Initially for whole of state data capture, the location of the features was sourced from existing government topographic maps, regional maps and photogrammetric data. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where necessary. The location and names of parks were extracted from the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB). The data had been loaded into the DCDB from a \"Park and Canal Name Attribute Project\" commenced in September 1999 for data acquisition for PSMA. For golf courses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Golf Union Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For rifle ranges, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Rifle Association Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For racecourses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Racing Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. Features for ongoing data capture are sourced from government and community websites and National Park maps and their location is digitized from current orthophotography and satellite imagery. Additional data is supplied by Geoscience Australia as part of their 25K large scale data capture and commitment to the National Topographic Information Coordination Initiative (NTICI). In most cases these features have been identified through fieldwork by Geoscience Australia staff. ",

    "description": "Land and emergency management agencies in Australia and\noverseas recognise the importance of an access network to support bushfire\nmanagement activities. Ground and aerial access provides a platform for fire\nreduction and readiness activities and provides opportunities to contain fires\nbefore they escalate into major fires that could otherwise incur significant\ncosts and potentially significant losses to community, cultural and\nenvironmental values.\n\n\nFire access within the ACT consists of a network of roads,\ntracks and trails that support fire prevention, readiness and response\nactivities. The identification and maintenance of fire access is an integral\nelement of fire management across the ACT.\n\n\nAccess management is divided into four areas :\n\n\n1.     maintenance\n\n\n2.     upgrade\n\n\n3.     construction\n\n\n4.     vegetation removal.\n\n\nACT PCS Fire Management Unit currently manage and maintain\napproximately 3,218 kilometres of roads and fire trails within the ACT. The\nclassification of fire roads, tracks and trails is performance based to provide\nclear guidance to response agencies during incidents.\n\n\nGround access is defined in four classes :\n\n\n1.     Float road – an access road\nor trail accessible to a low loader float carrying a large bulldozer or other\nheavy equipment.\n\n\n2.     Tanker road – a fire trail\nof strategic importance accessible to a heavy tanker and a tipper carrying a\nsmall bulldozer.\n\n\n3.     Light unit trail – a fire\ntrail accessible at minimum standard for a light unit.\n\n\n4.     Dormant fire trail – a trail\nthat has been deliberately closed or not maintained and can be quickly\nre-opened with minimal works.\n\n\nThe objective of ground access works are to upgrade and\nmaintain road pavements within the parks and reserves of the ACT to the above\nfour classes standard under the current Bushfire Operational Plan. Many areas\nrequire ongoing general maintenance or upgrading to an appropriate standard.\nThis is done principally to provide reliable access for operational\nrequirements and for fire suppression activities in the event of a wildfire\nthat may threaten the ACT.\n\n\nVegetation removal work is conducted by mechanical mulchers\nthat reduce vegetation on roads and trails that impede access for operational\nand fire suppression requirements identified under the current Bushfire\nOperational Plan. The Parks and Conservation Service Fire Management Unit also\ncommit a number of other contracted resources (graders, trucks, rollers,\nexcavators and backhoes etc) to conduct daily scheduled maintenance as well as\nupgrade and construction services on a yearly basis within the ACT.\n\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.actmapi.act.gov.au/\">Bushfire Map</a> shows the Environment, Planning &amp;\nSustainable Development  Directorate (EPSDD) Bushfire Operations Plan\n(BOP) for the current financial year.\n\n\nThe EPSDD BOP is derived from the 5-year Regional Fire\nManagement Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The EPSDD BOP details\nthe specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and\ninfrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current\nfinancial; year, in accordance with the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan\n(SBMP).\n\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2010 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in July 2010, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who consume more than two standard drinks per day on average. Lifetime risky alcohol consumption is defined as those adults who consume more than two standard drinks per day on average, thereby increasing their lifetime risk. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN106 should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates have a relative standard error of 25% to 50%.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "Night-time in-person spend is a key indicator of the value of the night-time economy, particularly economic activity driven by consumers outside their homes at night across NSW.  Perhaps more importantly, the night time in-person spend is also an indicator of people's participation in activities outside their homes at night, which supports social cohesion and personal wellbeing. \nThe data is sourced from NSW Government Customer Experience Survey (CXS).\nThe following caveats apply to the value of the night-time economy measures:\n\n\n'Spend data' is provided by Westpac based on transactions captured by card payment terminals, adjusted for its market coverage and client profiles to reflect the population total. Cash transactions are not included. Figures are nominal (not adjusted for inflation)\n\n\n'Annual spend' is the 'Moving Annual Total' (sum of previous 12 months' figures)\n\n",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

They have historically been captured by Spatial Services as part of the NSW digital topographic mapping program and therefore warrant inclusion.  The Features of Interest theme also defines the location of facilities such as Police Stations, Ambulance Stations and Hospitals which is crucial information for the citizens of NSW. The Features of Interest Category is primarily used for planning, developmental activities, navigation and resource monitoring by emergency services, the Defence Forces, environmental resource managers and engineers. This information is also commonly used by bushwalkers, canoeists, anglers and fossickers to establish a detailed picture of the local environment. The clear definition of these features is vital for emergency services in response situations.  Data included in the Features of Interest Category:Utility Water Supply Canal Tank Area Tank Point Place Point Building Complex Point Electricity Transmission Line General Cultural Point General Cultural Area General Cultural Line General Cultural Point General Line Feature General Recreation Point Place Area Metadata Initial Publication Date18/10/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department of Customer Service NSW).

This dataset was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is, 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:100000 = 50m. A program to upgrade the spatial location and accuracy of data is ongoing.Spatial Reference System (dataset)GDA2020Spatial Reference System (web service)OtherWGS84 Equivalent ToGDA2020Spatial ExtentFull stateContent LineagePlease contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubData ClassificationUnclassifiedData Access PolicyOpenData QualityPlease contact us via the Spatial Services Customer HubTerms and ConditionsCreative CommonsStandard and SpecificationOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC) implemented and compatible for consumption by common GIS platforms.

Data has been collected using a standard monitoring protocol outlined in 'Assessing estuary ecosystem health: Sampling, data analysis and reporting protocols. NSW Natural Resources Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Program', most recently updated in 2016 and available on the NSW environment website. The data has been used to monitor the aquatic ecosystem condition of over 160 estuaries in NSW over time. Adopting the principles of the National Water Quality Management Framework, the data has been used to develop NSW specific guideline values for a range of physico-chemical water quality indicators for each estuary type. This allows comparison of observed data to these guidelines to assess condition of any estuary in NSW. As part of the Marine Estate Management Strategy Implementation Plan Stage 1, a NSW water quality database has been developed, where this data is now stored. Water quality monitoring in NSW estuaries is ongoing, and updated data will be made available routinely.",

    "description": "Site U19 is sampled monthly by Norske Skog as part of the Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2021 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

The Lot and Property data was captured by digitising the best available cadastral mapping at a variety of scales and accuracies, ranging from 1:500 to 1:250 000 according to the National Mapping Council of Australia, Standards of Map Accuracy (1975). Therefore, the position of the feature instance will be within 0.5mm at the map scale for 90% of the well-defined points. That is 1:500 = 0.25m, 1:2000 = 1m, 1:4000 = 2m, 1:25000 = 12.5m, 1:50000 = 25m and 1:00000 = 50m. A program of positional upgrade (accuracy improvement) is currently underway. Feature heights have been derived from LiDAR elevation sources including 1m and 2m DEMS. The data used to create the DEMs have an accuracy of 0.3m (95% Confidence Interval) vertical and 0.8m (95% Confidence Interval) horizontal.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of people who delayed or did not see a GP when needed due to cost in the last 12 months. The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nThe data excludes pathology and imaging tests conducted in a hospital, and any dental imaging tests.\n\n\nIf respondents sought clarification on the definition of a medical specialist, interviewers were instructed to advise that medical specialists provide services which are covered, at least in part, by Medicare (e.g. dermatologists, cardiologists, neurologists and gynaecologists).\n\n\nImaging tests or diagnostic imaging include all tests that produce images or pictures of the inside of the body in order to diagnose diseases. Tests involve the use of radiant energy, including x-rays, sound waves, radio waves, and radioactive waves and particles that are recorded by photographic films or other types of detectors.\n\n\nPathology tests refer to laboratory tests that include analysis of specimens such as urine and blood in order to diagnose disease.\n\n\nThe survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2005 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "Temperate WA (Kendrick, Babcock, Smale): A cruise was undertaken in collaboration with the University of Western Australian and CSIRO to document benthic assemblages on temperate reefs off the coast of Western Australia in April, 2012. This cruise was the third in a 3 year series of IMOS AUV Facility cruises intended to establish a benthic habitat timeseries along the Eastern and Western coasts of Australia. These surveys have been repeated annually for three years. Surveys were conducted off Rottnest Island, Jurien Bay, and the Abrolhos Islands. Sites were surveyed at each location spanning three depths (15 m, 25 m, 40 m), both inside and outside MPAs, with three 25 m x 25 m full photo coverage quadrants devoted to each site. Site locations targeted kelp beds and were provided by the science party. The locations of individual quadrants within each site were selected to repeat surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011. Additional scientific operations carried out during the cruise consisted of CTD casts.",

The East Coast Flood Recovery Program 2023-2024 was a comprehensive program supporting long-term recovery from the 2022 floods by monitoring water quality in disaster-declared catchments along the East Coast of NSW. This dashboard presents data for three regions: The North Coast, Mid-Coast and Hawkesbury-Nepean River. The data available on the dashboard collates multiple water quality parameters from thousands of samples collected throughout the project, including water clarity (turbidity), algae (chlorophyll-a), nutrients and bacteria. This data has been collected through manual field sampling by the project team and in real-time via telemetered water quality loggers (2 land-based sites and 6 smart buoys).",

    "title": "Potential displacement of commercial fisheries by a Commonwealth marine reserve zoning scheme",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The Government commissioned an independent review of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves that were originally proclaimed in November 2012. The Department of the Environment commissioned ABARES to assess potential displacement of commercial fishing by alternative marine reserve designs and zoning options considered by the Bioregional Advisory Panel. The report details potential displacement by the network proclaimed in 2012 and the network recommended by the Panel in 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  • The potential impact of the Panel recommended (2015) zoning on commercial fisheries in the regions is relatively small, compared with the total gross value of production (GVP) from all wild capture fisheries. However, while much of the total impact is diffuse, some of the potential impact is concentrated in particular fisheries, entitlement holders and towns. \r\n• The Panel recommended (2015) zoning would potentially displace an estimated annual average 587.6 t of catch, with an annual average GVP of $4.51 million. This is less than the proclaimed network (2012), which would displace 1032 t of catch, with a GVP of $8.21 million. \r\n• For individual entitlements, there are a large number for which the potential impacts of the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning are relatively low (more than 700 entitlements with less than $2500 displaced per year) and a small number of entitlements for which the potential impacts are higher (17 entitlements over $50 000). The largest displacement from one entitlement was $164 000. These figures do not include South Australian entitlements because ABARES did not receive fisheries data at this scale for South Australian fisheries. A single business unit may hold multiple entitlements and so the impact on a business unit would be the sum of the individual entitlement impacts. \r\n• At the fishery level, the largest GVP displacements from the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning would be from the Western Australian West Coast Rock Lobster Fishery ($823 000), Commonwealth Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery ($585 800) and Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery ($488 200). \r\n• In terms of the proportion of GVP from the entire fishery, the largest displacements would be from the Commonwealth Coral Sea Fishery (71.2 per cent of fishery GVP), Western Australian North Coast Shark Fishery (33.9 per cent) and the Western Australian South West Trawl Fishery (13.2 per cent). \r\n• Towns with the highest potential GVP displacement were Mooloolaba in Queensland ($515 100), Geraldton in Western Australia ($449 200) and Fremantle in Western Australia ($406 300). \r\n• The estimated net economic impact of the Panel-recommended network would be reduced regional economic activity of $7.9 million in the short term. Potential short term employment impacts were separately estimated at 18 total jobs (estimate derived from previous economic modelling) and 49 jobs (estimate derived from previous surveys of fishers). Changes in economic activity at the state / territory level are expected to be negligible in terms of the size of the economies. These estimates have been made by rescaling previous economic modelling and survey results (from 2012); ABARES was not commissioned to undertake new economic modelling or surveys. \r\n\r\n Note: This document is hosted on the Department of Environment website.

    "description": "This dataset presents the statistics of hospitalisations with a principal diagnosis associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) excluding principal diagnosis of dialysis distributed by sex and age for the years between 2012-2015. The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

    "title": "AusUrbHI Spatial Variation in Indicators of Breast Cancer Outcomes for Women in Queensland (SA2) 2000-2019",
    "description": "The Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project, a collaboration between NCRIS facilities, AURIN, PHRN, and researchers, aims to improve understanding of urban and regional health. This dataset, developed with Cancer Council Queensland and the Australian Cancer Atlas, provides spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes in Queensland, exploring associations between various determinants and cancer patterns. The dataset’s goal is to identify spatial variations in breast cancer outcomes within Queensland, and motivate further research into their drivers.\nThis dataset includes seven spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes for Queensland women, modeled using Bayesian statistics, covering the period of 2000-2019. These indicators, presented as Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) with 95% credible intervals and posterior probability differences (ppd), are at the Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2). The dataset provides modelled statistical indicators and geographic data, covering breast cancer outcomes, spatial epidemiology, health disparities, and cancer surveillance at the SA2 level (2016 ASGS) in Queensland, Australia. The intended application is for identifying geographical disparities in breast cancer, informing public health planning, and enabling further research.\nThe methodology uses linked health datasets from the Queensland Cancer Register, BreastScreen Queensland, and the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patients Data Collection. Bayesian spatial models with Besag-Yorke-Mollié (BYM) priors were applied, using a Poisson distribution with the log of expected counts as an offset, and incorporating spatial terms for neighboring regions. Models were validated using trace plots, density plots, Moran’s I statistics, and Geweke statistics.\nThe data is structured as a table, with each row representing an SA2 region, and columns representing indicator values and associated metrics. The complete attribute dictionary for the dataset is shown below:\n\nsa2: Five digital sa2 code using 2016 ASGS\nsa2name: Name of each sa2 area\n\nurban: Categorical variable with three levels: 1. brisbane/gold coast; 2.

    "title": "Darling River Snail Indicative Distribution in NSW",
    "description": "The Darling River Snail (also known as ‘River Snail’) is a mediumsized (20-25 mm) freshwater snail that was once common and\nwidespread in the Darling River and its tributaries. However\npopulations declined rapidly over the last few decades, probably as a\nresult of weir building and other activities associated with river flow\nmanagement. They are now virtually extinct throughout their natural\nrange. In the last decade, living specimens have only been found\nfrom within irrigation pipelines in southern NSW. They are a critically\nendangered species – www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/threatenedspecies/threatened-species-list/critically/river-snail/river-snail\nThe methods used to create the predicted current distribution of the\nDarling River Snail are described fully in: NSW Department of\nPrimary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community Status 2015 – Final\nReport.\nAll available records of the species were collated and assessed for\naccuracy. For current distribution, only records after 1 January 1994\nwere used. Within the framework of the Australian Hydrological\nGeospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network, the records were\nassociated with attributes from the National Environmental Stream\nAttributes Database and River Styles® geomorphology. The\nAustralian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology\nnetwork (Geofabric) is a fully connected and directed stream network\nbased a 9 second DEM. It allocates a unique stream segment\nnumber to each river reach in Australia. The Environmental\nAttributes Database is a set of lookup tables supplying attributes describing the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the\nstream and catchment environment that was developed by the\nAustralian National University (ANU) in 2011 and updated in 2012.\nThe data is supplied as part of the supplementary Geofabric\nproducts which is associated with the 9 second DEM derived\nstreams and the National Catchment Boundaries based on 250k\nscale stream network. 30 Stream variables were assessed for the\nmodelling.\nRiver Styles® provides a high resolution categorical classification of\nriver character within a nested hierarchy of criteria based on valley\nsetting, channel planform, geomorphic units, and bed material. The\nNSW Office of Water compiled a spatial dataset of River Styles®\nclassifications for a large number of the waterways of NSW. From 65\nRiver Style® categories we generated two new fields representing\nPlanform (34 categories) and Substratum (8 categories) for each\nstream segment. River Style® planform and substratum categories\nwere then assigned to each Geofabric segment.\nMaxEnt 3.3.3 is a widely used species distribution modelling program\nthat utilises presence records to generate probabilities of occurrence\nbased on a suite of environmental variables quantified across the\narea of interest. It was used to model the current geographic\ndistribution of each listed threatened freshwater aquatic species or\npopulation. We utilised logistic output to plot the predicted\ndistribution of each species. This output equates to a probability that\nthe species will be observed in each river reach, given the\nenvironmental conditions that exist there relative to the\nenvironmental conditions where the species is known to occur. For\nthis mapping, above 33% probability was considered predicted\npresence. Only stream segments with a modelled average daily flow\nof more than five megalitres were selected for output. In addition,\npredicted separate populations were connected by manual\ninterpretation. The predicted values for each river reach were\nconverted from the Geofabric framework to the higher resolution\n2013 NSW Strahler Stream Order Hydroline.",

Division of Fisheries and Oceanography was set up to investigate the relationship between kelp: Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh 1820 and crayfish larvae. Alginates (Australia) P/L, based at Louisville in the Mercury Passage, were harvesting kelp at this time. This study was initiated to address concerns regarding the effect of harvesting on crayfish stocks.\nThe survey results are taken from an unpublished interim report presenting the results of the work at that stage (1965).\nApparently an aerial survey was used to determine stock distributions although this is not specified in the report.",

    "description": "Site NTB-13 is sampled monthly by the Nyrstar Hobart as part of the  Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual fishing effort by fishery and gear, that fishers have recorded in their logbooks for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea. Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nFishing effort is measured differently depending on the fishing method used. In this dataset we provide the most common measures that are used by scientists. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe effort data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Effort data are used in combination with catch data, spatial data, and other relevant information (such as independent surveys) to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time-period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may standardise effort for assessments to account for issues such as changes in gear efficiency, catchability of fish and skipper expertise. They may also filter out effort from their assessments because of data quality issues.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect effort each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as closures of fishing areas or reducing boat numbers. Similarly, changes in market demand can change fishing decisions and affect effort. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in April and May 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022009 Leg 1.\n\nDeparted: \tLautoka Fiji, April 22, 2009\nArrived:  \tNuku'Alofa, Tonga, May 18, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This thesis examines the relationships between human use and biological changes in the rocky intertidal zone of the Bunurong Marine Park, Victoria  between January 1990 and June 1991. The key areas of activities were to i) describe the  types and patterns of human activities on the reef,  ii) assess the impact  and recovery of reef biota to these activities with particular focus on Hormosira banksii, the dominant algal community and  iii) determine the natural fluctuations in reef communities to provide a baseline to detect future changes in response to protection.\r\n\r\nSurveys of human activities between January 1990 and April 1991 found walking to be the most common activity.  Levels of human use were greatest during school holidays followed by weekends and were lowest during term weekdays.  During school holidays use varied with the time of day and use on term weekend depended on weather.  \r\n\r\nThe impact of collecting intertidal gastropods and trampling were investigated.  There was no relationship between the observed patterns of human use and variations in the size distributions of collected and non-collected intertidal gastropods.  Experimental trampling showed that the dominant alga on these reefs, Hormosira banksii, was severely affected by trampling.  The cover of Hormosira was reduced by trampling and the decrease in cover depended on the level of trampling.  No significant effects of trampling were detected for any other species.   Trampled beds of Hormosirra banksii took well over a year to recover to the same level as adjacent mats. \r\n\r\nAlgal monitoring showed that the cover of Hormosira was stable over time, except for a large decrease due to desiccation in summer.  These findings are discussed in relation to the management of the Bunurong Marine National Park.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the crude percentage of adults who are overweight or obese. Adults were classified as overweight if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30, or obese if their BMI was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial years of 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe health risks factors reported are known to vary with age and the different PHN area populations are known to have a range of age structures. As such, comparisons of results between the PHN areas should be made with caution because the crude rates presented do not account for these age differences.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

This service controls the precision of numerical output in a manner that mirrors SCIMS Online available through the Spatial Services Portal.\nThe web service provides a wealth of data on each mark, including:\n<ul><li>Mark type (Permanent Mark, State Survey Mark, etc.) </li><li>Mark number </li><li>Horizontal coordinates and their accuracy (class and order) </li><li>Heights and their accuracy (class and order) </li><li>Status of the mark (destroyed, restricted access, etc.) </li></ul>\n\nThe Mark type is represented using various shapes and the accuracy of the mark (both vertical and horizontal) is communicated by the colour. \nThis web service allows users to easily integrate survey control mark data from SCIMS into Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant spatial platforms and applications. \nData provided by the NSW Survey Mark web service can be used in a variety of engineering and surveying applications, including but not limited to: \n<ul><li>Cadastral survey planning </li><li>Flood studies and hydrographic modelling </li><li>Infrastructure development</li><li>Site calibration at construction sites </li><li>Elevation modelling </li><li>Preservation of survey infrastructure</li></ul>\n\nThe NSW Survey Mark web service gives users an alternative method to access state control survey data that can be incorporated into their GIS package without needing to log into SCIMS Online.\n<b>Please note that SCIMS Online is the official option for obtaining state control survey data for cadastral surveys as it offers legal traceability.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and attended 5 or more antenatal visits, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWomen who gave birth at 32 weeks or more gestation to a livebirth or a stillbirth, with known number of antenatal visits (includes women with no antenatal care).\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The commissioning of new dedicated FRB detection systems has led to an exponential increase in the detected FRBs over the last decade. Despite &gt;700 FRBs published to date, there is still a lack of understanding about the physical mechanisms through which FRB emission is produced. Due to the possibility of detecting multiple bursts from the same source in a repeating FRB, it forms an ideal sample set to uncover the physics of the source (e.g., emission mechanism, progenitor surrounding media), and test possible progenitor models. The coherent upgrade to the FRB detection system to ASKAP is expected to detect ~1-2 FRB/week. However, due to the limited fractional bandwidth available with ASKAP and survey nature of the telescope, probing the spectro-polarimetric characteristics of repeating sources is non-optimal. Hence, the large bandwidth offered by the ultra wideband-low (UWL) on Parkes/Murriyang is an ideal instrument to follow-up repeating FRB sources discovered through CRACO. Over the next ~6 months, we expect to double the number of repeaters that have been studied through the UWL. This will provide unprecedented insight into the progenitor environment and the surrounding media of repeating FRBs. We propose using the UWL to follow up repeater-like sources to study their wideband spectro-polarimetric characteristics.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.3) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n \n The flux station is located within an area of dryland agriculture. The surrounding area is dominated by broadacre farming practices. The vegetation cover is predominantly pasture. Elevation of the site is close to 330 m. Climate information comes from the nearby Pingelly BoM AWS station 010626 (1991 to 2016) and shows mean annual precipitation is approximately 445 mm with highest rainfall in June and July of 81 mm each month. Maximumum and minuimum annual rainfall is 775 and 217 mm, respectively. Maximum temperatures range from 31.9°C (in Jan) to 15.4°C (in July), while minimum temperatures range from 5.5°C (in July) to 16.0 °C (in Feb).",

The images can be accessed via the urls provided in the data.\nRichard Woldendorp was born in Utrecht, The Netherlands in 1927 and migrated to Perth in 1951.

Woldendorp's fascination with photography and skill rapidly grew and in 1961 won first and third prizes in the Craven-A National Photographic competition. As a professional photographer Woldendorp was intrigued by Australia's landscapes with a special passion for aerial photography. In 1991 Woldendorp was made a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Professional Photography, then in 1998 was admitted as a Honorary Life Member to the Australian Commerical and Media Photographers (A.C.M.P.), then to the A.C.M.P.

    "description": "This dataset consists of an atlas of the habitat quality of the urbanized and agricultural landscapes of the Mission beach region in August 2006, 6 months after cyclone Larry. This analysis and classification includes habitat quality, canopy cover, vegetation quality, vegetation types, tenure type and aerial photography at a resolution of 0.5m.\n\nThese maps of habitat quality highlight potential priority areas for maintenance and/or restoration of connectivity and is a tool for natural resource managers to implement restoration goals at Mission beach.\n\nAll the PDF maps for this atlas can be accessed from the \"Mission Beach - Habitat Quality Atlas page\".\nhttp://eatlas.org.au/mission-beach_jcu_habitat-quality-2006_atlas\n\nThis work was undertaken as part of MTSRF Project 4.9.3. The remote sensing analyses used a novel computerized Anaglyph technique for stereoscopic classification of aerial photographs flown 6 months after Category 4 cyclone Larry. Vegetation polygons of canopy cover and vegetation type were digitized. GIS-based rapid assessment of habitat quality combined vegetation quality with remnant area or riparian width, an analysis providing an excellent surrogate of field-determined habitat quality in rural areas unaffected by cyclones. Field-truthing of the remotely sensed data at 44 sites in coastal Mission beach included rapid transect assessments of vegetation structure, disturbance and microclimate parameters. Repeated bird surveys over 2 years provided an indicator of faunal habitat quality.\n\n\nData Units:\n\nEach map consists of a 1 km x 1 km section of the Mission beach region with the following classifications:\n* Habitat Quality: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor, Cleared\n* Percentage Canopy Cover\n* Shape/Size index\n* Vegetation Quality Index: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor, Cleared\n* Vegetation Types: Rainforest, Sclerophyll Rainforest, Sclerophyll Open Forest, Sclerophyll Woodland, Sclerophyll Open Woodland, Melaleuca Woodland, Melaleuca Swamp Open Forest, Melaleuca Swamp Woodland, Melaleuca Swamp Open Woodland, Grassland, Beach Ridge & Swale, Mangrove, Samphire, Plantation, Cleared\n* Aerial Photography (0.5 m resolution)\n* Tenure: Freehold Land, Reserve State Lease, State Land\n\n\nReferences:\n- Goosem, M., Habitat quality and potential improvements to connectivity in the Mission Beach area, MTSRF Conference 2010",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC10) was collected from a depth of 335 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Isotopic values for 18O and 13C were obtained from Gs. ruber and correlated with the SPECMAP age-model. Radiocarbon dating of G. sacculifer was also undertaken at three sample depths, and then corrected and correlated with the curve. This yielded an age vs. depth profile from which it was possible to determine approximate sedimentation rates. The results place the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) date at 130cm and highlights a peak in sedimentation rate during the penultimate glacial / interglacial transition. Down the core the sedimentation rates vary considerably from a high of 12 cm/kyr down to <1 cm/kyr. This is probably the result of a considerable change in the sediment flux related to the sea level fluctuations.",

    "description": "The River Murray Channel Monitoring Plan (RMCMP) focuses on monitoring River Murray system scale responses to coordinated water for environment delivery in the Southern Connected Murray-Darling Basin. It builds on existing monitoring programs to fill gaps and to evaluate ecological responses to flow at as system scale, to inform and improve the way water for the environment is managed.\r\n\r\nImplementation of the RMCMP is expected to significantly improve monitoring coverage in the River Murray, focusing on productivity and fish indicators that will directly inform improved management and coordination of flows. Implementation is expected to focus on 2021-22 in the first instance, with commitments for future years not yet made. A key element of the Plan is an annual review of implementation, which will inform any refinements to the Plan over the five year period.\r\n\r\nThe RMCMP, jointly funded by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) and Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), examines the productivity and fish responses to flow in the River Murray Channel. Monitoring occurs at 4 reaches: 1) Hume to Torrumbarry, 2) Torrumbarry to Euston, 3) Euston to SA border and 4) SA border to Wellington. The data set includes fish census (abundance, length), ageing (otolith) and length/weight data. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dcceew.gov.au/water/cewo/publications/river-murray-channel-monitoring-plan-2021-22-to-2025-26\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH RMCMP (2023) <INSERT DATASET TITLE>.

Both SVTM and SVTM (Pre-Clearing) map each Plant Community Type, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation at a regional scale across all tenures in NSW. Pre-clearing PCT mapping is available for both eastern NSW and Far Western NSW. Coverage of Central NSW is a work in progress. \n\nPre-clearing extent of PCTs was developed using a combination of aerial photographic interpretation, environmental layers and historical documents. This map is updated periodically as part of the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/integrated-bionet-vegetation-data-for-nsw\">Integrated BioNet Vegetation Data</a> program to improve quality and alignment to the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy. \n\nFurther information and technical documents about the SVTM is available from the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/state-vegetation-type-map\">State Vegetation Type Mapping Program Page</a>\n\n<strong>Current Release C2.0.M2.2 (December 2025)</strong>\n\nThis release includes revisions, using the most recent NSW PCT Classification Master list (represented by “C2.0” in the version release number).

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for the summer period between December 1989 to February 1990. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the season. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals throughout the duration of the experiment.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",
