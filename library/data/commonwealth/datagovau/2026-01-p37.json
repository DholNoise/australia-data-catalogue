    "description": "The operational map for Montane Peatlands and Swamps was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the eastern Regional Forest Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) reviewed the determination for Montane Peatlands and Swamps and agreed upon a set of diagnostic parameters for its identification through aerial photograph interpretation (API). These parameters included an elevation of greater than 400m and, broadly, the presence of treeless native vegetation on poorly drained soils. \nUsing API, we then assessed whether Montane Peatlands and Swamps is present within more than 828,000 hectares of state forests within the coastal, tableland and montane regions of eastern NSW. A number of State Forests were excluded from the assessment because they fell below the elevation threshold or were underlain by Triassic sandstone sediments, which are explicitly excluded in the determination for Montane Peatlands and Swamps. \nIn total we identified 1729.5 hectares of candidate Montane Peatlands and Swamps across State Forests in eastern NSW. From this we constructed several operational maps showing the extent of the Montane Peatlands and Swamps TEC within the relevant State Forests. More than 60% of the total mapped areas were located in the southern tablelands. The largest areas of the candidate TEC were mapped in Bago, Glenbog and Badja State Forests in the south, and in Boonoo and Girard State Forests in the north. Patch size varied, with more than 200 patches being smaller than 0.1 hectare and around 50 patches being larger than 30 hectares. \nIt is noted that the broad mapping criteria will have captured a wide range of floristic assemblages including swamps, bogs, marshes, fens, meadows, grasslands and herb fields. Not all of these assemblage will be Montane Peatlands and Swamps, and it is highly likely that the mapping has captured two related TECs due to their overlapping environmental gradients and similar vegetation structure. These two TECs (Upland Wetlands of the Drainage Divide of the New England Bioregion and Carex Sedgeland of the New England Tableland, Nandewar, Brigalow Belt South and NSW North Coast Bioregions) are both candidate TECs within State Forests in their own right.\nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory.

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. A landscape classification approach was used to determine how hydrological changes due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development may affect ecosystems at a landscape scale in the Cooper GBA region. Seven landscape classes have been identified for the Cooper GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nInputs into the landscape classification were based on existing classification schemes wherever possible and can be purely physical, biological or predictive.\r\nThe landscape classification developed for the Cooper GBA region is a harmonisation of the Queensland Land Zones (Wilson and Taylor, 2012) and South Australian Land Systems (Santos, 1997), reflecting the substantial areas of the Cooper Basin in both states. Consistent with the principles outlined above, it sought to use existing data sources and classifications, and to leverage the extensive effort already expended to develop highly relevant conceptual models at both landscape scale and wetland scale by the Queensland Government as part of its Wetlands Program (Department of Environment and Science (Qld), 2017).\r\nDetailed land zones (Qld) within the Cooper GBA region were supplied by the Queensland Government (Department of Environment and Science (Qld), 2018a) and assigned to corresponding landscape classes. Land systems in South Australia (Santos, 1997) were coarsely mapped in the 1990s; hence, landscape classes for the Cooper Basin within SA were refined from land systems based on land system mapping, detailed (1:100 000) surface geology (Department for Energy and Mining (SA), 2018), elevation (Geoscience Australia, 2008) and landscape position inferred from 30 m Landsat images.",

    "description": "# What is IPGOD?\r\nThe Intellectual Property Government Open Data (IPGOD) includes over 100 years of registry data on all intellectual property (IP) rights administered by IP Australia. It also has derived information about the applicants who filed these IP rights, to allow for research and analysis at the regional, business and individual level. This is the 2019 release of IPGOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How do I use IPGOD?\r\nIPGOD is large, with millions of data points across up to 40 tables, making them too large to open with Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, analysis often requires information from separate tables which would need specialised software for merging. We recommend that advanced users interact with the IPGOD data using the right tools with enough memory and compute power. This includes a wide range of programming and statistical software such as Tableau, Power BI, Stata, SAS, R, Python, and Scalar.\r\n\r\n\r\n# IP Data Platform\r\nIP Australia is also providing free trials to a cloud-based analytics platform with the capabilities to enable working with large intellectual property datasets, such as the IPGOD, through the web browser, without any installation of software. [IP Data Platform](https://www.ipdataplatform.com)\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\nThe following pages can help you gain the understanding of the intellectual property administration and processes in Australia to help your analysis on the dataset.\r\n\r\n* [Patents](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents/)\r\n* [Trade Marks](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/)\r\n* [Designs](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/designs/)\r\n* [Plant Breeder’s Rights](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/plant-breeders-rights/)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Updates\r\n\r\n### Tables and columns\r\n\r\nDue to the changes in our systems, some tables have been affected.\r\n\r\n* We have added IPGOD 225 and IPGOD 325 to the dataset!\r\n* The IPGOD 206 table is not available this year.\r\n* Many tables have been re-built, and as a result may have different columns or different possible values. Please check the data dictionary for each table before use.\r\n\r\n### Data quality improvements\r\n\r\nData quality has been improved across all tables.\r\n\r\n* Null values are simply empty rather than '31/12/9999'.\r\n* All date columns are now in ISO format 'yyyy-mm-dd'.\r\n* All indicator columns have been converted to Boolean data type (True/False) rather than Yes/No, Y/N, or 1/0.\r\n* All tables are encoded in UTF-8.\r\n* All tables use the backslash \\ as the escape character.\r\n* The applicant name cleaning and matching algorithms have been updated. We believe that this year's method improves the accuracy of the matches. Please note that the \"ipa_id\" generated in IPGOD 2019 will not match with those in previous releases of IPGOD.",

    "description": "A glacial refuge-dependent forest community is considered to be one that occupies a climatic or topographic refuge retaining elements of the climatic regime of the last Ice Age. Rainforest undoubtedly qualifies as such a community in Tasmania. \n\nThe last Ice Age began in the Quaternary Period, around 40 000 years BP; it peaked between 20 000 and 17 000 years BP, continuing to a lesser degree until 10 000 years BP. During this time there was glaciation in the Snowy Mountains and the land bridge between Victoria and Tasmania was re-established. \n\nAs well as being colder, the climate was much drier. After about 10 000 BP temperatures and precipitation began to increase, reaching a post-Ice Age peak about 8000 years ago. The climate has since become slightly drier, although the warming effect of the ocean has maintained higher rainfall in sub-coastal areas. \n\nParts of Tasmania exhibit relatively steep environmental and topographic gradients. This means that slight changes in global climate may produce significant localised effects.\n\nThis database is a digital polygon coverage of Tasmania (captured at 1:500 000) detailing glacial refugia areas. Glacial refugia are coded with a unique number and the relevant National Estate values and criteria.\n\nAll sites in this coverage are classified according to National Estate criteria A1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Governments under the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) data agreement of 8th November 1997.This data is available to the public under licence from the Department as part of the Commonwealth Spatial Data Access and Pricing Policy.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmanian Government 1997.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "The  Australian fisheries economic indicators report  expands on and takes the place of the long running ABARES  Australian fisheries surveys report. The report presents results from ABARES' fishery surveys on financial returns to fishers and net economic returns from fisheries to the Australian community. The report includes a range of other economic indicators, including productivity analysis. \r\n\r\nThis report covers the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS), and the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector (GHTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with new results for financial years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. \r\n\r\n Key issues  \r\n• Profit at full equity - an estimate of profits based on all assets being fully owned by operators - has decreased since 2008-09, from $267 000 to $205 000 in 2012-13. In the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector, it has fallen from $200 000 in 2008-09 to $15 000 in 2012-13. This indicator assumes that all assets are fully owned by operators, and includes income from all sources. \r\n• Net economic return in the Commonwealth Trawl Sector has declined from $7.3 million in 2010-11 to an estimated $1.4 million in 2013-14. Net economic returns in the Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector has declined from $7.2 million to an estimated -$4.4 million in 2013-14. \r\n• The decline in net economic returns in both sectors may suggest that the total allowable catch settings may be misaligned with the Harvest Strategy Policy target of achieving maximum economic yield from the fishery. \r\n",

    "description": "The 2015 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census' content is designed to establish the views of APS employees on workplace issues such as leadership, learning and development and job satisfaction. The census ran from 11 May to 12 June 2015. Overall, 91,937 APS employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 66%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_\r\n \r\nThree files are available for download. \r\n\r\n* 2015 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2015 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2015 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2015 APS employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document.\r\n\r\n* 2015 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2015 APS employee census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2015 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2015 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending June 2018. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in November 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1213R0.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, November 17, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, November 22, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes.

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>irrigated wheat</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This is a multi-sensor SSTfnd L3S product for a single 72 hour period, derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the NOAA AVHRR SSTskin observations, and 0 degC to the Metop and VIIRS SSTsubskin observations, after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (&lt;6 m/s by day and &lt;2 m/s at night). The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 72 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

    "description": "This dataset comprises the phytoplankton abundance and biovolume estimates as part of a broader sampling program carried out at the Southern Ocean Time Series, a facility within the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). The primary focus is sustained observing of ocean properties and processes important to climate, carbon cycling, and ocean productivity. Regular phytoplankton samples are collected at approximately 14 day intervals (exact intervals and seasonal coverage dependent on deployment length). The moorings are serviced annually, at which time the existing moorings are recovered and new moorings are deployed. Water samples from within the surface mixed-layer are collected at pre-programmed intervals using a Remote Access Sampler, in pairs about 1 hour apart. One sample in each pair is preserved for phytoplankton community composition by microscopy, and the other sample is preserved and used for accompanying chemical analysis of nutrients, total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity. \nEach sample is collected from within the surface mixed-layer at 32 m depth (2010 - 2017) or 5 m depth (2018-current) depending on the design of the mooring surface assembly and instrumentation. Typically a maximum of 24 samples are collected over an annual deployment cycle. The samples collected are analysed for: 1. Community composition / abundance (cells/L) 2. calculated biovolume (um3/L). Protocols for the phytoplankton time-series are described in Eriksen et al (2018), and the annual sample reports for each deployment.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2011.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial years between 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient care data collection systems in Australian hospitals in each state and territory. The NHMD is based on data provided to the AIHW by state and territory health authorities for the National minimum data set (NMDS) for Admitted patient care.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nData by PHN should be interpreted with caution due to variations in admission practices, and because patients may be hospitalised outside the PHN where they reside.\n\n\nThe quality of data provided for Indigenous status varies. Time-series analyses may also be affected by changes in the quality of Indigenous identification over time.\n\n",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThis dataset represents a historic annual time-series of estimated habitat condition across the study region, from 2001 to 2018 inclusive. These spatial grids were developed by combining two spatial data products: (1) a new analytical approach called Compere, which contrasts the vegetation cover of each location with a set of environmentally similar locations across the region, for each year; (2) a temporally static spatial layer on the total length of all linear anthropogenic disturbances, in each 500 m grid cell across the study region. The resultant habitat condition spatial time-series is therefore intended to combine information on both localised (e.g. roads, seismic surveys) and dispersed (e.g grazing, fire)  influences on the habitat condition for biodiversity of each location, ranging continuously from '0' (completely degraded) to '1' (pristine).\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nTo derive a past-to-present time-series of habitat condition across the buffered study regions, we combined two spatial data products. The first set of spatial data come from a new analytical approach called Compere, which contrasts the vegetation cover of each location with a set of environmentally similar locations across the region. For the present purpose, we applied the Absolute Range Ratio (ARR) metric from Compere, which for each location at a time-point is the observed vegetation cover divided by the maximum vegetation cover across all the environmentally similar locations at that time-point. The ARR spatial layers were available for each year from 2001 to 2018 inclusive. To translate the ARR spatial layers to better represent a habitat condition metric (h_ARR), we rescaled the ARR values as: \r\nh_ARR=ARR+(k×((100-ARR)/100))\r\nwith the scalar k specifying the minimum habitat condition value set to 40 % for the present analysis.\r\n\r\nThe second spatial dataset used in deriving habitat condition for biodiversity was a spatial layer on the total length of all linear disturbances in each 500 m grid cell across the study regions. We converted this layer into a habitat condition metric (hL) by assuming complete habitat loss for a width of 10 m for all linear disturbances, then taking the inverse of the proportion of each grid cell area that was disturbed.\r\n\r\nThese two data sources on habitat condition provide complementary information. The h_ARR condition metric derived from the Compere analysis is useful in detecting the broadscale impacts of actions such as grazing and fire management across the region on habitat condition. In contrast, the hL condition metric derived from the spatial data on linear disturbances is useful in identifying known disturbances, such as roads, fence-lines and seismic survey lines. We therefore combined these two condition metrics, using a conservative approach of taking the minimum condition value from each of these metrics, for each grid cell:\r\nh=min(h_ARR,h_L )\r\nassuming a constant level of linear disturbance over the time period of the Compere analysis (2001-2018). This provided an historic annual time series of habitat condition across each study region.",

    "description": "The Sign Feature Class sits within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Assets Geodatabase. The Signs layer includes Panel, Plank and Totem signs on and sometimes adjacent to NPWS Estate and what type, style and material they are.\n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially. The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes. The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS. The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field. AMS is also set up to be used by other OEH Divisions eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point. \n\nNote that for external supply of the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed. Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.\n\nDetailed documentation is available including: - Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets) - Data Model - Business Rules - Functional Location and Naming Convention",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of small for gestational age births, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nBabies are defined as small for gestational age if their birthweight is below the 10th percentile for their gestational age and sex, according to national birthweight percentiles. Includes singleton liveborn babies with known birthweight, gestational age and sex.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

Health programs will begin transitioning to the new MMM from 1 January 2020.\r\nThe 2019 MMM uses the following data sets: \r\n•\tAustralian Statistical Geography Standard 2016 Statistical Area 1; and Urban Centres and Localities as the geographic bases; \r\n•\tAustralian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Area 2016 as the ABS remoteness classification (based on Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA+); \r\n•\tEstimated Resident Population 2016; and \r\n•\tPublic Sector Mapping Agency 2018 Australian road network. \r\n",

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

It will be fitted with surface salinity and bottom depth and temperature in late 2008. \n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors. The buoy is re-locatable and the GPS data should be used to find the current location.",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "    \n\nThis data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment.aDesignated irrigation\nareasa indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\nThe precise meaning of the term adesignated irrigation areaa varies from\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\nsource material is highly variable and completedness of coverage is poor in\nsome regions.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\n__00211a01.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This polygon dataset shows the position and names of Recreational Areas within the State of Queensland. Recreational areas include: - civic Squares, gardens, golf gourses, miscellaneous areas (e.g. basketball courts, bowling clubs, caravan parks, netball courts, tennis courts, velodromes , ovals, parks, race courses, racetracks, rifle Ranges, showgrounds, zoos). This purpose of this dataset is to provide the position and names of Recreational Areas for use in Land Administration,Topographic Mapping and in the production of Navigational and Web Based Mapping applications. Additional Information: This data has been compiled from numerous sources to produce a state wide coverage with the boundaries aligned in most cases with the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB)or captured from the best available imagery with an attribute within the data describing the source and reliability. Source data include: Queensland digital cadastral database, Queensland regional mapping, Queensland orthophotography, satellite imagery, Geoscience Australia, community and government websites. The horizontal positional accuracy of the data that has been used to compile this dataset is as follows: Orthophotography +/- 1m, Satellite Imagery +/- 2.5m. The horizontal positional accuracy of DCDB is dependent on the accuracy of the DCDB at the time of extraction.Initially for whole of state data capture, the location of the features was sourced from existing government topographic maps, regional maps and photogrammetric data. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where necessary. The location and names of parks were extracted from the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB). The data had been loaded into the DCDB from a \"Park and Canal Name Attribute Project\" commenced in September 1999 for data acquisition for PSMA. For golf courses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Golf Union Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For rifle ranges, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Rifle Association Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For racecourses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Racing Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. Features for ongoing data capture are sourced from government and community websites and National Park maps and their location is digitized from current orthophotography and satellite imagery. Additional data is supplied by Geoscience Australia as part of their 25K large scale data capture and commitment to the National Topographic Information Coordination Initiative (NTICI). In most cases these features have been identified through fieldwork by Geoscience Australia staff. ",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

    "description": "<b>Oct 2024 Minor Amendment No.3</b>\n<b></b>\n(Zone Map Dataset 1 of 5, needs to be used in conjunction with Local plan boundary, Local plan precincts, Zone precincts and North Lakes Locality datasets).\n\nThe Zoning Map is part of the Moreton Bay Regional Council Planning Scheme. MBRC Planning Scheme will help to respond to growth and development across the Moreton Bay Region. It is a statutory document regulating how land can be used and developed. The MBRC planning scheme replaces the three previous planning schemes created by the former Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe councils.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

The areas are based on the existing 1:250,000 geological mapping with additional use of 1:25 000 lithological mapping in the Broken Hill area. The datasets also include point data information on sites where naturally occurring asbestos has been found, and petrographic information on asbestos and its host rocks. The different dataset layers can be switched on or off (and their transparency adjusted) by clicking the 'Layers' icon at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on a polygon or point will return more detailed attribute information.

The layers were created in the following way:\n\nThe Rolling Downs Group layer was extracted from the GABATLAS Rolling Downs Aquitard - thickness and extent.  \n\nThe Pilliga Sandstone layer in the GAB was extracted from the GABATLAS Cadna-owie-Hooray Aquifer and Equivalents - Thickness and Extent. The Pilliga Sandstone in the Oxley (Gunnedah) Basin was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model.\n\nThe Purlawaugh Formation and Garrawilla Volcanics layer in the GAB was calculated using Layer 10 Great Artesian Basin base of Jurassic-Cretaceous sequence surface (GABWRA) and Layer 05 Great Artesian Basin base of Hooray Sandstone and equivalents surface (GABWRA). The Purlawaugh Formation and Garrawilla Volcanics in the Oxley (Gunnedah) Basin was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model.\n\nThe Interburden 1 layer was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model and combined the source layers of the Deriah and Napperby Formation, the Digby Formation and the Black Jack group above the Hoskissons Coal layer (layers 7, 8 and 9 in Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Hoskissons Coal layer was extracted directly from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model (layer 10 in the Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Interburden 2 layer was extracted from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model and combined the source layers of the Black Jack Group below the Hoskissons coal and the Millie Group (Watermark and Porcupine formations) (layers 11 and 12 in Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\nThe Maules Creek Formation layer was extracted directly from the Namoi Leapfrog geological model (layer 13 in the Namoi Leapfrog geological model).\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2017) Namoi BA geological model.

The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a05.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "A dataset of enrolments (FTE) of all schools in Victoria, based on collections from the February 2022 schools census, including Government and non-Government Schools (Catholic and Independent schools).\nInformation collected from the February school census of Victorian schools: For each school, Full Time Equivalent (FTE) enrolments by school type and year level are included. A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.\nFor this 2022 census year data, the students' sex/gender category is not included for the following reasons:\n•   The gender of 'self-described' was implemented at the beginning of 2022 for Victorian government schools. Enrolments with this gender value are collected in the 2022 February School Census results but this value is currently under-represented.\n•   Due to the small numbers of enrolments with the 'self-described' gender, there is the potential for individuals to be identifiable at the school and year level.\n•   The 'self-described' counts are in their infancy and will likely increase over time but at this stage the department deems to risk of possible identification as too high for publication.",

    "description": "Modelling of landscape capacity for 75 landscape-managed NSW threatened species. \n\nLandscape capacity is a measure of how usable habitat is for supporting populations based on the quality of habitat and how easily species can move across the landscape to access sufficient resources to support a population. This project maps climate-informed landscape capacity. This mapping shows how well NSW landscapes can support fauna populations into future climate. The location of climate refugia are identified. These are areas that support species populations through time, from pre-industrial times and into the future.\n\nThe methods and descriptions of outputs are provided in the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/persistence-landscapes-project\">project report</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/d44cb0df-0242-4db3-9126-8c26aba7f80a/resource/27c36e75-690e-4fcd-88b4-b89bbdfafeba/download/plp_reportcards_final2025.pdf\">Two page species forecasts</a> summarise results for each species.\n\nEach species model is projected into NARCliM (v1.0) climate futures. The dataset comprises: individual models for 1750, 2000, 2030 and 2070 epochs; 'consensus' maps across 12 climate models for 2070; and multi-species refugia and landscape capacity across time maps (<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/edf6e375-57c5-4f55-93f0-422a0af1900c\">for the 75 threatened species</a>, and also including site-managed species <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/c76d5cd9-b3d1-4622-a4d5-55aed553e38b\">here</a>). \n\nThe individual species geotiff files are grouped into zip files which are large and may take considerable time to download.\n\nThese resources are outputs of the Persistence in the Landscape Project (PLP).

    "title": "IMOS - AUV SIRIUS CAMPAIGN: TASMANIA, JUNE 2009",
    "description": "Tasmania (Barrett, Lucier - TAFI; Johnson, Ling - UTAS) The primary objective of this work was to describe biological assemblages associated with rocky reef systems in deep shelf waters on the Tasman Peninsula in SE Tasmania and in the Huon, Freycinet and Bruny Island Marine Protected Areas (MPA), providing a record of community composition at or near the time of designation of these MPAs. Detailed multibeam sonar bathymetry data were previously collected by Geoscience Australia (GA) to provide high-resolution digital elevation maps of the study areas. These maps were used to determine suitable AUV survey locations. At each location, multiple reefs were surveyed at a range of depths from approximately 50 m to 100 m depth. Dive profiles were designed to provide sufficient replication to quantitatively determine abundances of key species/features within depth strata, within reefs, between reefs (km to 100 km scale), and between differing levels of reef complexity. The AUV deployments were part of a multi-disciplinary experimental program to analyse the covariance of co-located fine-resolution seabed habitat data, provided by the EM3002 multibeam sonar coverage, and biological datasets collected at similar spatial scales by Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Baited Remote Underwater Video systems, towed video and the AUV. This program was undertaken with UTAS and GA as part of the Marine Biodiversity Research Hub, a collaborative program funded under the Commonwealth Government's Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities Program. In addition, the AUV completed high resolution, full seafloor coverage day and night dives at St Helens in the North East to document nocturnal feeding habits of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii whose poleward extension has had a significant impact on kelp beds in the North East of Tasmania.\n\nTasmania 06/2009\nScallop fisheries at Maria Island, Freycinet MPA, St Helens urchin barrens, Bruny Island MPA; 18 dives over 7 days of operations.",

    "description": "This dataset includes the number of enrolments in NSW government schools from 1848 to 2023.\nData Notes:\n\n\nSince 1993, some students have enrolled part-time. All enrolments are reported in full-time equivalent (FTE) units and include full-time and part-time students. \n\n\nStudent enrolments are rounded to the nearest whole number. \n\n\nFrom 1881 to 1907, primary enrolments relate to students undertaking ordinary public school courses. However, post-primary pupils in superior public schools are included in the primary figures. Primary correspondence school (later distance education centres) pupils are also included from 1938, and the school of the air pupils from 1976.\n\n\nFrom 1938, post-primary enrolments relate to student undertaking post-primary courses in high, intermediate high, district, junior high, central, superior public schools and correspondence school (later distance education centres). Pupils undertaking post- primary courses in small primary schools are also included. Evening continuation school pupils are not included.\n\n\nFor the period from 1881 to 1907 it has not been possible to isolate the number of post-primary pupils in superior public schools and consequently they are included under primary enrolments. This is the reason for the large jump in post-primary enrolments in 1908.\n\n\nFrom 1962 to 1983, all pupils in special schools or classes (except those in some community care schools who were not counted until 1981) are included as appropriate in the primary or post-primary figures and in the total.  Since 1984, students in Schools for Special Purposes have been counted separately.  Prior to 1962 it was difficult to ascertain if these pupils are included. Children in hospital schools and schools for the physically and intellectually disabled are sometimes included in the primary figures during the late 1950s, but physically and intellectually disabled children in special classes in ordinary schools are included from the late 1940s.\n\n\nThe enrolment figures between 1848 to 1918 are for the December quarter, with those for 1848 to 1851 and 1866 being estimates. From 1919 the annual census figures are used resulting in a sharp drop in primary and rise in post-primary enrolments in 1919. Pupils from the ACT are included until 1973, at which date they numbered 30,457.\n\n\nData source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin. Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

    "title": "Leg 189 Synthesis: Cretaceous-Holocene  History of the Tasmanian Gateway",
    "description": "Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 189 drilled five sites in bathyal depths on submerged continental blocks in the Tasmanian Gateway, to help refine the hypothesis that its opening near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary led to formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), progressive thermal isolation of Antarctica, climatic cooling, and development of an Antarctic ice sheet. In all, 4539 m of marine and largely continuous upper Maastrichtian to Holocene core were recovered, with a recovery rate of 89%. The sedimentary sequence broadly consists of shallow marine mudstones until the late Eocene, glauconitic siltstones during the late Eocene, and pelagic carbonates thereafter. The microfossils in the mudstones and siltstones are largely palynomorphs and diatoms, and those in the carbonates are largely nannofossils and foraminifers.\n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, northward movement of Australia away from Antarctica commenced, forming the Australo-Antarctic Gulf (AAG). However, a Tasmanian land bridge at 70?-65?S almost completely blocked the eastern end of the widening AAG until the late Eocene, there being no evidence of extensive current circulation across the ridge until the earliest Oligocene. Prior to the Oligocene, muddy marine siliciclastic sediments were deposited in temperate seas. During the late Eocene, the northeastern AAG was warmer and less ventilated than the gradually widening southwest sector of the Pacific Ocean, which was affected by a cool, northwesterly flowing boundary current ? a difference that may have existed since the Maastrichtian. In the late Eocene (~37 Ma), the Tasmanian land bridge and its broad shelves began to subside, currents swept the still-shallow offshore areas, and condensed glauconitic siltstones were deposited. Palynological and diatom evidence suggest a general cooling. The southwestern South Tasman Rise finally separated from Antarctica at the time of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~33.5 Ma), the rise subsided, and the continental margin of Tasmania collapsed. The Tasmanian Gateway opened to deep water, disrupting oceanic circulation at high southern latitudes, and leading to one of the major climatic shifts of the Cenozoic.\n\nThereafter, a marked reduction in siliciclastic supply, and the flow of warm currents from northern latitudes, favored the deposition of carbonate. At the eastern sites, deposition of Oligocene bathyal carbonates directly followed an unconformity caused by the onset of the ACC, but change was more gradual in the west. In contrast, siliceous biogenic sediments typified the Antarctic margin, now isolated from warm water by the ACC. Steady northward movement kept the Tasmanian region north of the Polar Front throughout the Neogene, and pelagic carbonates accumulated.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Cocos Island - DEM - 2011\nIn 2011 AAM was commissioned by the Commonwealth to fly an airborne laser scanning survey of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The survey was carried out using a fixed wing aircraft between the 8th and 16th of August 2011 and covers the whole of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. All data was captured within approximately 2 hours of low tide. During this period tides ranged from 0.4m to 1.3m. \n\nAAM classified the raw LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points using a single algorithm across the project area. The raw LiDAR points in the .las format were provided to Geoscience Australia along with 1km by 1km ESRI grid tiles generated by interpolation from the points. The tiles were then joined to create a DEM (TIFF) that covers the full extent of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Each cell, 1m x 1m, in the grid contains the height in metres of the ground surface. \n\nAs a guide, the DEM data is vertically accurate to 15cm and horizontally accurate to 30cm. A control survey was carried out by Whelans. Manual checking and editing was carried out by AAM to improve accuracy. Positional accuracy has been checked by Geoscience Australia and was found to match the ground surface well.   The DEM grid file was generated in GDA94 and has been converted to UTM WGS 84 zone 47s to fit the rest of the Cocos GIS data.  Vertical data was collected in the Cocos Keeling Island Height Datum (CKIHD).\n\n<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/utilities/disclaimer.aspx\">Disclaimer</a>",

It represents those sedimentary basins in the North-west commonwealth marine planning region that are considered to be prospective for petroleum, and it has been attributed with a rating describing the relative prospectivity of different areas. This interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity is derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins. The classification terms used represent a simplified qualitative assessment of petroleum prospectivity, and are subject to future change as new data are gathered and interpreted.\n\nThe information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the North-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe Sedimentary Basins dataset itself provides outlines for the maximum extent of Australian geological provinces and their components, including sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic provinces, both onshore and offshore.  These data were compiled as part of Geoscience Australia's integrated digital information system to provide improved accessibility and knowledge relating to the petroleum and minerals geology and prospectivity, and to provide a national stratigraphic and tectonic framework for Australia.  The current Sedimentary Basins dataset is not complete for Australia, and covers only offshore sedimentary provinces and a selection of sedimentary and igneous provinces in onshore eastern Australia.The information has been provided to DEWHA in good faith, as an input to bioregional marine planning and MPA development in the North-west marine planning region. It should not be taken as a definitive Geoscience Australia view of the petroleum prospectivity of these areas.\n\nThe following caveat applies to the use of the data in any mapping products:\n'The interpretive data on relative petroleum prospectivity are derived from Geoscience Australia's internal quantitative basin evaluation work, modified in some cases after consultation with their own internal experts on particular basins.

Regions with notable management concerns both currently and possibly in the future were identified to become management subareas. Allocation subareas will be used in the calculation of sustainable yields, flow rates and ultimately these calculations will be available for water allocation and natural resource management decisions. In addition, native vegetation clearing values have been calculated for each of the subareas located within the extent of the South-West region of Western Australia, for input into the allocation process.\n\nThe Surface Water subarea data was developed in order to give a clear understanding of surface water availability and to provide management tools to make good water allocation and natural resources management decisions.",

This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

This is an essential guide for use when matching the vegetation polygons to the correct orthophotos.\r\n\r\nA list of the orthophotos and orthophoto mosaics used for the vegetation mapping, with locations, is as follows:  ('orthoantc' signifies 1987 series, 'orthocasc' signifies 1980 series.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the rates of Affected Family Members (AFMs) of Family Violence Intervention Order (FVIO) applications heard in the Victorian Magistrates' Court, retrieved from Courtlink. The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of AFMs per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of AFMs on original applications in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: AFM rate = (Number of AFMs/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nTo avoid double counting individuals, demographic information of applicants/AFMs and respondents are of those on original applications.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nDue to improvements made in data processing since the database release ending 30 June 2017, slight movement has occurred in numbers of AFMs and the number of applications outcomes.\n\n\nData was extracted from Courtlink on 30 August 2018.\n\n",

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the cattle tick model in the Biosecurity Risks node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the climate suitability for each month, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \n\nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a25.xml) for more detail.\n\n",
