The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from the 2011-12 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Australian Health Survey (AHS): National Health Measures Survey.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nPopulation in this dataset refers to 'population at risk' as modelled by the ABS. For more information, see the Explainatory Notes.\n\n\nCKD prevalence estimates are based on measures of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) to identify biomedical signs of CKD.\n\n",

    "description": "Collection contains scripts and data associated with the techno-economic analysis of fugitive methane abatement from Australian landfills\n\nAuthors: Andy Wilkins, Jun-Seok Bae, Courtney M Regan\n\nThis report directory holds scripts and data associated with the 2025 CSIRO Report \"A techno-economic analysis of landfill fugitive-emission reduction strategies in Australia\" by Andy Wilkins, Jun-Seok Bae and Courtney M Regan (EP-2025-5206).  The Report provides context for this collection.\n<ul>\n<li>Scripts are python scripts.  You will need to <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to run the scripts.</li>\n<li>The techno-economic analysis is performed by scripts in the <code>code/bin</code> directory.  In the <code>code/tests</code> directory, there are tests of <code>code/lib</code> classes, with test coverage ~100%, which may be run using <code>pytest</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>figures</code> directory contains python scripts to generate figures in the report.  Generally, they just synthesise <code>data_and_reports</code> and confidential data into useful graphical representations.  The confidential data that are hard-coded into the python scripts are aggregated forms of the raw confidential data provided to the authors from Government and Commercial sources.</li>\n<li>Data is in the <code>data_and_reports</code> directory.  Only publicly-available data is provided.  Some aspects of the techno-economic analysis rely on confidential data obtained from Government and Commercial sources, and those data are not included here, and cannot be supplied to readers.</li>\n<li>The <code>initial</code> directory contains a few preliminary analyses.  These are provided for interested readers, but are irrelevant for most readers.</li>\n</ul>",

    "title": "Georges Hall Catchment Flood Study",
    "description": "The Study Area\n\nThe Georges Hall study area is located in Bankstown, south west Sydney and is contained within the\nsuburb of Georges Hall. The Georges Hall catchment area is approximately 140 hectares of\npredominantly residential land. Elevations range from over 50 mAHD in the east to approximately 2.5\nmAHD along the banks of Prospect Creek and the Georges River. The catchment drains in a\nwesterly direction along three distinct drainage lines though much of the flow is overland with the first\nnoticeable channel appearing within the Amaroo Reserve towards the downstream extent of the\nstudy area.\n\nThe Georges Hall catchment is bounded to the north by Flinders Road, south by Birdwood Road and\nBeale Street, to the east by the Crest Reserve and to the west by the Georges River. The catchment\nforms part of the wider Prospect Creek / Georges River catchment which discharges into Botany Bay.\nThe eastern boundary of the study area in Crest Reserve forms the catchment divide with the\nVillawood Drain catchment, which itself is a tributary of Prospect Creek. More information relating to\nthe hydrological catchment is outlined in the Georges Hall Catchment Flood Modelling Report, in\nAppendix B.\n\nThe Floodplain Management Process\n\nThe prime responsibility for planning and management of flood prone land in New South Wales rests\nwith local government. The NSW Government provides assistance on state-wide policy issues and\ntechnical support. Financial assistance is also provided to undertake flood studies and floodplain\nmanagement studies, and for the implementation of works identified in these studies.\nFlood Prone Land Policy and the Floodplain Development Manual (NSW Government, 2005) form\nthe basis of floodplain management in New South Wales.\n\nThe objectives of the Policy include:\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the impact of flooding and flood liability on existing developed areas by flood mitigation\nworks and other measures; and</li>\n<li>Reducing the potential for flood losses in new development areas by the application of\necologically sensitive planning and development controls.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Policy provides some legal protection for Councils and other public authorities and their staff\nagainst claims for damages resulting from their issuing advice or granting approvals on floodplains,\nproviding they have acted substantially in accordance with the principles contained in the Floodplain\nDevelopment Manual.\nThe implementation of the Flood Prone Land Policy generally culminates in the preparation and\nimplementation of a Floodplain Management Plan. The Georges Hall Catchment Flood Study is one\nof the first steps in preparing the Plan, and involves an assessment of existing flood conditions\nthroughout the catchment. The steps in the floodplain management process are summarised in\nFigure 1-2.\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all public drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Information on potential constraints in the drainage assets for various storm events;</li>\n<li>A property database including surveyed floor levels, flood levels and the resulting floor level\nimmunity, expressed in the magnitude of a storm event;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood behaviour due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "A habitat suitability model at a 250 m resolution for the Koala Phascolarctos cinereus in north-eastern New South Wales using ‘presence only’ records and MaxEnt modelling. Model extent was based on the extent of Crafti vegetation mapping for north east NSW. Substantial spatial clustering of records in coastal urban areas was reduced using a 2 km spatial filter and by modelling separately two sub-regions divided by the 500 m elevation contour. An average of 1086 occurrence records was used to develop models. A bias file was prepared that accounted for variable survey effort, including the concentration of Koala records along sealed and unsealed roads. A reduced set of 14 variables was used in model building. The models were evaluated using a test set of 25 % of the records, with a resulting good fit for each model, as measured by AUC. Frequency of wildfire, Australian Soil Classification, floristic mapping and elevation had the highest relative contribution to the model, whilst a number of other variables made minor contributions. The model was field validated at 65 ground-truth sites.",

The catchment at Penrith is 52% of the total area and of this portion, 80% is under the control of Warragamba Dam.\nThe Nepean valley within the Penrith LGA is characterised by a relatively narrow floodplain that is divided into three parts by the river channel. The northern floodplain area encompasses Penrith Lakes and the eastern side of the valley. The channel divides the valley south of this with the western side over Emu Plains and the eastern side over the Mulgoa and Central Business District (CBD) area.",

During high rainfall events the catchment areas behave differently to deliver contaminants into the Port Jackson estuary. Under conditions of high rainfall contaminants are delivered to areas very quickly as freshwater slides over the top of the denser more saline waters of the estuary. Sonde samples, for measurement of conductivity, salinity, turbidity and temperature; were taken along the Port Jackson estuary over three days to determine the behaviour of the freshwater plume as it travels in a layer of freshwater to be flushed or flocculate out at some point in the estuary.",

Read the complete annual report http://www.psba.qld.gov.au/publications/annualReport/Pages/default.aspx\nNote:\nOn 7 September 2020, the Queensland Government announced its intention to integrate the PSBA functions and staff into the public safety agencies of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES), as part of a wider strategy to structurally reform government statutory bodies and agencies and increase further efficiencies in the delivery of quality outcomes to Queensland communities. \nOn 27 May 2021, the Queensland Parliament passed the Debt Reduction and Savings Bill which repealed the Public Safety Business Agency Act 2014, resulting in the PSBA being abolished from 1 July 2021.\nThe disestablishment of the PSBA and the corresponding functional transition into the QPS and QFES, as per the Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 2) 2021 (AAO), was completed by 30 June 2021.\nDue to the disestablishment of the PSBA, all Open Data records within the Queensland Open Data Portal relating to the PSBA have been migrated to QPS.\nFor enquires or further information about the PSBA, please contact the QPS or QFES using the comments section or the contact us page.",

The equipment consisted of a Widco Logger with one movable electrode capable of measuring Resistivity to a depth of 500 feet. An adaption has been made to this equipment to enable Self Potential to be measured. The details of work done are listed in Table 1 and the results of the logging as compared with the usual method of core-logging are summarized briefly hereunder.",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThe dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains polygon and line shapefiles representing the Gloucester terrestrial (both a multipart and singlepart version) and riverine Landscape Classes respectively. It also contains KMZ exports of these features.\n\n\n\nNote for the 2016 March 9 IESC Deep Dive for GLO was necessary to tease out the Keith Forms of the \"non-GDE native vegetaton\" Landscape Class in order to generate areal statistics for endangered species habitats. This sub-LC differentiation is retained in this dataset. \n\n\n\nThe polygon landscape Classes are as follows.\n\n\n\nTerrestrial (polygons)\n\nForrested Wetlands\n\nFreshwater Wetlands\n\nRainforests\n\nDry sclerophyll forests\n\nWet sclerophyll forests\n\nSaline wetlands\n\n(Non-GDE) Native vegetation (with Keith Forms)\n\nPlantation or production forrestry\n\nDryland agriculture\n\nIrrigated agriculture\n\nIntensive uses (includes mining)\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe terrestrial Landscape class polygons are sourced directly from the two input polygon source datasets and clipped to the Gloucester PAE.\n\n\n\nGDE landscape classes derive directly from the source NSW OoW GDE layer's Keith Form attribute, though the \"Riverine Forests\" Keith form are combined with the \"Forested Wetlands\" LC and the \"Mangrove Swamps\" and \"Saltmarshes\" Keith Forms are combined to form the \"Saline Wetlands\" LC . \n\n\n\nThe remaining non-GDE terrestrial LC polygons are mainly sourced from the ACLUM catchment landuse from the PRIMARY V7 classification, and retain the source class names except that  \"1 Conservation and natural environments\" is rename the \"non-GDE Native Vegtation\" LC.  A further exception  is the \"Plantation and Production Forestry\" LC. This is derived from the SECONDARY_V7 classification where:\n\n\n\n\"SecondV7\" = '2.2 Production forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '3.1 Plantation forestry' OR \"SecondV7\" = '4.1 Irrigated plantation forestry'\n\n\n\nThe Riverine LC lines are derived directly from the Rivertypes source dataset\n\n\n\nNote for the 2016 March 9 IESC Deep Dive for GLO was necessary to tease out the Keith Forms of the \"non-GDE native vegetaton\" Landscape class in order to generate areal statistics for endangered species habitats. These were sourced from the Greater Hunter vegetation mapping.

The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2011 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This data shows February census enrolment figures. All enrolments are self-reported in full-time equivalent (FTE) units and include both full-time and part-time students.\nData Notes:\n\n\nData is self reported by schools at the start of Term 1 each year and is sourced through the School Entitlement System. Enrolment numbers are a major component linked to government funding.\n\n\nStudent enrolments are generally reported in FTE units. The FTE for students studying less than 10 units, the minimum workload, is determined by the formula: 0.1 x the number of units studied and represented as a proportion of the full-time enrolment of 1.0 FTE.\n\n\nStudents in Years 11 or 12 can enrol to study as a part-time student or a full-time student. For the annual census, a part-time student is enrolled in less than 10 units, regardless of where those units are studied. All Kindergarten to Year 10 students are considered to be full-time. Pre-school students can be enrolled on a part or full time basis.\n\n\nAll special education support class and Intensive English class enrolments are full-time, whilst distance education enrolments can be part-time.\n\n\nPrincipals must ensure that each student is only counted once. For example, support class enrolments cannot be counted under mainstream as well.\n\n\nA full-time Year 11 student studies 12 or more school delivered units, or a combined total of 12 or more school delivered units and non-school delivered VET units.\n\n\nA full-time Year 12 student studies 10 or more school delivered units, or a combined total of 10 or more school delivered units and non-school delivered VET units.\n\n\nOperational directorates given with school names are the current 2023 directorates. Due to changes in directorates over time this may mean enrolments by operational directorate is not comparable over time.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nOnline Management of School Enrolment and Entitlement system (OMSEE).\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2016 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

A treatment episode is the period of contact between a client and a treatment provider where there are defined start (commencement) and end (cessation) dates. It is considered closed where any of the following occurs: treatment is completed or has ceased; there has been no contact between the client and treatment provider for 3 months; or there is a change in the main treatment type, principal drug of concern or delivery setting.\nThe alcohol and other drug treatment services (AODTS) data is based on data reported to the AODTS National Minimum Dataset (NMDS). The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe AODTS data accompanies the Alcohol and other drug treatment services in Australia 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit: \n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - AODTS Data Tables.\n\n\nAlcohol and other drug treatment services NMDS 2016-17 Quality Statement.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe PHN of the client was assigned based on the reported postcode of the client using the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Postal Area 2013 to Primary Health Network 2015 concordance file. Clients with an invalid postcode were assigned to the PHN group 'PHN Unallocated' and removed from the analysis.\n\n\nTreatment episodes are excluded from the AODTS NMDS if they: are not closed in the relevant financial year; are for clients who are receiving pharmacotherapy and not receiving any other form of treatment that falls within the scope of the collection; include only activities relating to needle and syringe exchange; or are for a client aged under 10 years.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2016 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

It enabled these organisations to digitise and web publish descriptions (and often images) of their collections and information resources.\r\n\r\nThe primary output was the eHeritage website http://eheritage.statelibrary.tas.gov.au/ at which 30 organisations regularly added descriptions and images.\r\n\r\nThe data was presented at the website under 4 key fields:\r\n\r\n* Title\r\n* Objects\r\n* Subjects\r\n* Institution\r\n\r\nThis is represented in the structure of the open data sets.\r\n\r\nThe website was archived in 2013.  \r\n\r\nBy then 26,317 rows of raw data had been created that describe items held in cultural collections across Tasmania.

    "description": "Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. \n\nExperiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. Previous experiments have revealed that owners win more contests than floaters because they are more motivated. This experiment was designed to test if owners are more motivated than floaters because they have invested more in neighbour relations.\n\nThe results indicate that the total amount of time a male has been present in a territory did not affect his fighting succes. The amount of time he spent on the surface or with his burrow open represented the time he could interact with neighbours, had a marginally significant influence on fighting success. Establishing relations with neighbours appear to convey at least a small increase in motivation leading to a weak fighting advantage.",

The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 1-minute averages of the observations are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of environmental observations as well as ship parameters (such as speed and direction). Wind is observed with two different sensors, and the relative (observed) and true (relative to fixed earth) wind speed and direction provided. Air temperature and humidity is observed on the port and starboard of the main mast. Short-wave (sunlight) and long-wave (infra-red radiation or heat, from sky and clouds) is observed on the port and starboard side of the monkey island (above the bridge). Precipitation is observed with an optical rain-gauge and traditional siphon gauge from the foremast.  Instrument meta-data and QC flags are also contained in the files.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the number of distinct specialist homeless services clients by client type, sex and age group. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2017 Primary Health Networks (PHN).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has set suppressed values (\".\") as Null.",

The data shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their ANZSIC1 industry and small area allocation. The data is aggregated to the 2016 Blocks for CLUE Boundaries and covers the year period of 2010.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data acquired through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.Spatial Resolution - 6 cmSpatial Accuracy - 3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)Spatial Accuracy Notes - Accuracy compared against visible survey marks (See Bundaberg_Urban_2021_6cm_SISP_AT_Report.txt) and visually checked with Cadastral data.Map Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary SphereRectification Surface - Merged LIDAR and Photogrammetry Derived DTM by Outline Global 1m LIDAR DTM derived as part of the National Elevation Data Framework and Coastal and Urban DEM Program and sourced from https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/. The statedFundamental Vertical Accuracy (FVA) is +- 30cm @95% confidence interval and Fundamental Horizontal Accuracy (FHA) is +-80cm @95% confidence interval. Outline Global have not verified the stated vertical and horizontal accuracy of the 1m LIDAR DTM.Description of Rectification - Rectification performed using the results of bundle block adjustment and merged LIDAR DTM and DTM derived from the same aero-triangulation. Individual orthophotos were generated with the outer 10% to 15% of the image removed. This ensures that the auto-generated cutlines avoid the extreme edges of images where building or tree lean and overall seamlessness is likely to be higher. A seamless orthophoto mosaic from the individual orthophotos was produced utilising Photomod-Geomosaic. The software auto generates seamlines using a detailed Voronoi diagram algorithm that typically avoids placing cutlines in areas of large contrast (building roofs, mine pits etc.). The cutline locations are manually reviewed by an operator and where necessary they are adjusted to avoid tall objects, remove solar flare on water bodies and improve overall seamlessness.Tile Size / Grid - 1km2Limitations of DataThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.   \n \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th of November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

Data were processed using PyFluxPro (v3.4.17) as described by Isaac et al. (2017). PyFluxPro produces a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER).\n\n The Calperum Chowilla site was established in July 2010 and is managed by the University of Adelaide, coordinated by Prof Wayne Meyer and Prof David Chittleborough of the Landscape Futures Program as part of the Environment Institute. This is a former sheep grazing property that has been destocked and is being managed as a conservation area in this type of ecosystem. The landscape is flat with a series of low east–west sand dunes. The dunes are remnants of a previous dry era and are mostly now stabilized by mallee (multi-stemmed Eucalypt trees) and various shrubs. It is a semi-arid environment fringing the River Murray floodplains of the Riverland. ",

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital single point coverage of a Jokulhlaup event near Casey Station (ie outburst of water from beneath a cold ice-cap terminus on Law Dome). This event was observed and documented by Dr Ian D Goodwin. The Jokulhlaup is represented as a point which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. From the results of oxygen-isotope and solute analysis, the water was found to have originated as basal melt water. It contained a high total solute load with a dominant enrichment in alkalis, indicating that it has been squeezed through subglacial sediments for an extensive time period. This event represents one of the first known recordings in Antarctica and provides further insight into determining the subglacial hydrological regime beneath the Law Dome ice cap.",

    "description": "This is a report written under the auspices of the University of Sydney Ocean Technology Group.  The report contains a good collection of data and content from other sources.  The abstract on USYD's eprints repository described the report as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Water has always been the earth's most valuable natural resource for human beings and ecosystems. Reductions in water quality and quantity have serious negative impacts on ecosystems. Over the past several decades, a tremendous growth in human populations and industrial activities has resulted in a significant demand for fresh and clean water. To meet these challenges and meet the pressures of demand it is critical to find a new alternative of water resource as the natural water resources have almost vanished. In spite of the high cost of desalinated water, an important quantity is already produced to meet the necessity for fresh water worldwide. \r\n\r\nDesalination could hold the key for new fresh water resources. Some arguments will be raised\r\nagainst building desalination plants on the grounds of environmental impacts to the surrounding\r\narea, especially to marine life due to the high concentrated brine discharge that diffuses back into\r\nthe ocean. The impacts of the brine discharge are due to the high level of salinity and total alkalinity and alteration to the temperature. These impacts could be considerable in terms of the influence on the marine organisms such as the development of species, survival of larva and breeding and reproductive traits. However this paper provides some evidence that the influence of discharge for desalination plant can be neglected in terms of any environmental impact to the\r\naquatic flora and fauna species.\"",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2005 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "AFSA publish provisional quarterly and annual personal insolvency statistics on bankruptcies, debt agreements and personal insolvency agreements for all states and territories. \r\n\r\nBankruptcy is a process where people who cannot pay their debts become bankrupt to receive the protection of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and their estate is administered by a trustee. It allows for the fair distribution of property among creditors and the prosecution of dishonest debtors.\r\n\r\nA debt agreement is an arrangement between a person who cannot pay their debts and their creditors. It is a formal arrangement under Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act. A debt agreement results from creditors voting to accept a proposal from a debtor to settle their debts. To be eligible to propose a debt agreement, a debtor must be insolvent and meet threshold levels relating to unsecured debts and assets and after-tax income.\r\n\r\nPersonal insolvency agreement (PIA): under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act, a personal insolvency agreement results from creditors accepting a debtor’s proposal to settle his or her debts. Unlike debt agreements, personal insolvency agreements are not subject to income, asset or debt thresholds.\r\n\r\nPlease see our guide to learn more about the provisional personal insolvency statistics (https://www.afsa.gov.au/resources/statistics/provisional-bankruptcy-and-personal-insolvency-statistics/guide-to-provisional-personal-insolvency-activity-statistics).\r\n",

This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFlood fringe - the area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway where development could be permitted provided it is compatible with flood hazard and building conditions provide an adequate level of flood protection. These areas are generally covered by still or very slowly moving waters during a 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodway - the river channel and a portion of the floodplain where a significant flow or storage of water occurs during floods. If the floodway is even partially blocked then the natural flooding regime of th area may be detrimentally impacted with flood levels being raised and affecting areas which may not have been previously affected. Development in floodways is to be avoided wherever possible.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as FPM Floodplain Area (DOW-054)",

Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/).

    "description": "Study Area\n\nThe study area is located in south west Sydney and includes parts of the suburbs of East Hills,\nPanania and Picnic Point. It is an urban catchment that drains through a stormwater pipe network and\nMonash Creek to the Georges River. Much of the study area is also at risk of flooding from the\nGeorges River, and an upstream deflector levee and blockwall finger levees have been constructed\nto mitigate this risk in the Carinya Road area. The Lucas Road catchment is wholly within the\nBankstown City local government area (LGA).\n\nOutcomes from the Study\n\nThe main outcomes from this study include:\n<ul>\n<li>A database of all Council drainage assets within the study area;</li>\n<li>Establishment of a computer model capable of assessing flood behaviour;</li>\n<li>Information on flood behaviour under existing catchment conditions;</li>\n<li>Predicted change in flood levels due to the potential impacts of climate change; and</li>\n<li>A model that can be used to assess flood mitigation options and future development proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDatabase of Drainage Assets\n\nAll drainage asset data collected by Council for the study has been incorporated into a GIS database.\nThis allows the data to be spatially represented across the study area and easily retrieved as\nrequired. Information in the database includes data for some 370 stormwater pits and 480 stormwater\ndrainage pipes.\n\nOther catchment data, including aerial photography, property cadastre, building footprints and the\nterrain surface (based on ALS survey) is also incorporated into a GIS database.\n\nComputer Modelling\n\nA numerical computer model was developed for the catchment to simulate flood behaviour, using the\nsoftware TUFLOW. Surface flows are represented in the model through a two-dimensional grid\ncovering the entire study area. The stormwater pit and pipe network is included as one-dimensional\nelements within this grid. Full details of the modelling approach, modelling parameters and other\nassumptions are outlined in the Lucas Road Catchment Flood Modelling Report, which is included as\nAppendix C.\n\nExisting Flood Behaviour\n\nDesign flood behaviour has been computed for a range of floods, ranging from relatively frequent\nevents to more extreme floods.\nThe model produces a grid of results over the study area providing data on flood levels, flood depths\nand flood velocities. Flood level contours have also been prepared showing contours of flood heights\nthroughout the study area. This data is provided digitally and can be overlaid on base mapping such\nas aerial photos and cadastral plans showing property boundaries.\n\nAll flood model results have been provided to Council for incorporation into their GIS database. Much\nof this information is also included as A4 sized plans included in Appendix C.\nIt is understood that once the Flood Study has been adopted by Council, the GIS information\nresulting from this Flood Study will be used for floodplain management purposes, including\nassessment of flood-related development constraints on properties. Potential flood mitigation options\nwill be assessed in the subsequent Floodplain Risk Management Study phase of the floodplain risk\nmanagement process.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "description": "A Vaisala WXT520 integrated weather station has been installed on RP2, a 6m steel pole which has been installed within the lagoon of Lizard Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef. The sensor-relay pole provides a platform for the installation of sensors to measure and monitor water conditions within the lagoon of Lizard Island. The pole has real time communications using 900MHz spread spectrum radio back to a base station on Lizard Island.\n\nThe weather station provides measurement of air temperature (Deg. C.), humidity as relative percent, barometric pressure (milliBars or hPa), rainfall amount, intensity and duration, hail amount, intensity and duration (not common on coral reefs!) and wind speed and direction. The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values. From these you can get the average wind conditions at either 10 minute or 30 minute periods as well as the gust or maximum wind conditions.\n\nThe weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Lizard Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.\n\nIdentical weather stations are also on Heron Island (southern GBR), One Tree Island (near by) and Orpheus Island (central GBR). A light sensor is also located on the Island itself to give measures of PAR.",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.0) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.   \nThe Tumbarumba flux station is located in the Bago State Forest in south eastern New South Wales. It was established in 2000 and is managed by CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research. The forest is classified as wet sclerophyll, the dominant species is Eucalyptus delegatensis, and average tree height is 40m. Elevation of the site is 1200m and mean annual precipitation is 1000mm. The Bago and Maragle State Forests are adjacent to the south west slopes of southern New South Wales and the 48,400 ha of native forest have been managed for wood production for over 100 years. The instrument mast is 70m tall. Fluxes of heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide are measured using the open-path eddy flux technique. Supplementary measurements above the canopy include temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, incoming and reflected shortwave radiation and net radiation. Profiles of temperature, humidity and CO2 are measured at seven levels within the canopy. Soil moisture content is measured using Time Domain reflectometry, while soil heat fluxes and temperature are also measured. Hyper-spectral radiometric measurements are being used to determine canopy leaf-level properties. The Tumbarumba flux station is supported by TERN and the DCCEE through the ACCSP.

    "description": "The NSW Bateman's Marine Park 90m (BMP090) mooring is located at Latitude:36.19 S, Longitude:150.23 E. It was first deployed on 2011-03-30. \n\nIt is one of two moorings deployed near Narooma, southern NSW, to capture the variability of the shelf waters, poleward of the East Australian Current (EAC) separation point. The location, adjacent to Bateman's Marine Park (BMP), was chosen for its proximity to other IMOS activities (AATAMS line and AUV survey sites), the availability of suitable vessels for servicing, and to minimise the risk of mooring loss due to commercial fishing. \n\nInstrumentation, position in the water column and sampling regime are consistent with other NSW IMOS moorings. The mooring consists of AQUAtech 520T and 520PT AQUAloggers at nominal 8m spacing through the water column, sampling at 5 minute time intervals. Nominal heights above seabed of the instruments and quantities measured are: 6PT, 14T, 22T, 30T, 38PT, 46T, 54PT, 62T, 70PT.\n\nThe BMP moorings are serviced every 6-8 weeks. This mooring was discontinued and removed in April 2014.",

    "description": "A series of six 6m steel poles have been installed in the lagoon of Heron Island as part of the sensor network deployment at Heron Island. The poles serve two purposes; their primary purpose is to form the backbone of a wireless network that covers the entire lagoon system and secondly they themselves support a range of sensors mounted onto the pole or leading away from the pole. One pole (RP5) also supports a Vaisala WXT520 weather station.\n\nThis record is for Sensor Relay Pole 2. The pole is solar powered and routes data from the Sensor Floats and other Sensor Relay Poles back to the Base Station located on Heron Island. The system uses the Campbell Scientific CR1000 loggers and RF411 Spread-Spectrum radios to process and route the data. The poles also can support a range of sensors, this pole also has a simple bottom mounted thermistor using the MEA thermistors.\n\nThe unit will be serviced every six months and will be used in the future for attaching new sets of sensors.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from the N-S transect, running from Red Point in the north, to Bristol Point in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nFor each day of sampling two resources are provided in a compressed (zipped) folder: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station.  For a number of sampling days a third resource is offered, providing vertically averaged CTD data over 4m depth bins.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nPopulation projections provide a picture of the population as it may develop in future years. They provide an indication of the size and age-sex structure of the future population if specified assumptions about future fertility, mortality and migration are realised. \nPopulation projections are not forecasts and do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors (whether in Australia or overseas) might have on demographic behaviour.\nFor more information please read the Population Projections User Guide.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThe data has been transposed to present the population age groups as distinct columns and use a compulsory filter to select the projection year.\n\n\nPopulation numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. They should not be taken to be accurate to that level of detail.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of general practitioner (GP) attendances and associated Medicare benefits expenditure per person. GP attendance has been calculated with the total services from eligible claims (excluding any bulk-billed incentive items or other top-up items), divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as at 30 June 2016. GP expenditure has been calculated with the total benefit paid for eligible claims, divided by the ERP as at 30 June 2016. The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nGP after-hours attendances are Medicare benefit-funded after-hours patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. They include urgent and non-urgent attendances.\n\n\nExpenditure on GP/specialist attendances comprises MBS funding for patient/doctor encounters. Expenditure is reported unadjusted for inflation.\n\n\nBulk-billing is an arrangement in which a medical practitioner sends the bill directly to Medicare, so the patient pays nothing. Also known as direct billing.\n\n\nAge-standardisation allows fairer comparisons to be made between areas by accounting for variation in the age of populations within each area. This adjustment is important because the rates of many health conditions and health service use vary with age.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2005 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "<strong>Current Extent</strong>\n\nThe State Vegetation Type Map (SVTM) is a regional-scale map of NSW Plant Community Types. This map represents the current extent of each Plant Community Type, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation, across all tenures in NSW. This map is updated periodically as part of the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/integrated-bionet-vegetation-data-for-nsw\">Integrated BioNet Vegetation Data</a> program to improve quality and alignment to the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy.\n\nAn SVTM pre-clearing PCT map is available <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-state-vegetation-type-map-pre-clearing\">here</a>.\n\nFurther information about the mapping methods is available from the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/nsw-bionet/state-vegetation-type-map\">State Vegetation Type Mapping Program Page</a>\n\n__Current Release C2.0.M2.2 (December 2025)_\n\nThis release includes revisions, using the most recent NSW PCT Classification Master list (represented by “C2.0” in the version release number). PCT spatial distributions were manually edited based on user and community feedback since the previous C2.0.M2.1 release. In addition, changes were made to the Native Vegetation Extent mask which is used to create the Native Extent map.\n\nDetailed technical information is available <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/nsw-state-vegetation-type-map-technical-notes-2025\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>Data Access</strong>\n\nMap data may be downloaded, viewed within the SEED Map Viewer, or accessed via the underlying ArcGIS REST Services or WMS for integration in GIS or business applications.   \n\nThe Trees Near Me NSW app provides quick access to view the map using a mobile device or desktop. Download the app from Google Play or the App Store, or access the web site at <a href=\"https://www.treesnearme.app/explore\">https://treesnearme.app</a>.\n\n<strong>Map Data Type</strong>\n\nThe map is supplied as ESRI Feature Class (Quickview) and 5m GeoTiff Raster, and can be viewed and analysed in most commercial and open-source spatial software packages. If you prefer to use the download package, we supply an ArcGIS v10.8 mxd and/or a layer file for suggested symbology. The raster attributes contain PCT, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation.\n\n<strong>Feedback and Support</strong>\n\nWe welcome your feedback to assist us in continuously improving our products. To help us track and process your feedback, please use the SEED Data Feedback tool available via the SEED map viewer.   \n\nFor further support, contact the BioNet Team at <em><a href=\"mailto:bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au.</a></em>\n\n<strong>Useful Related Data</strong>\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-bionet-flora-survey-data-collection-pctreferencesites\">NSW BioNet Flora Survey Plots – PCT Reference Sites</a>: full floristic plots used in the development of the quantitative Plant Community Type (PCT) classification.

    "description": "Annual permitted take (APT) is a critical component of sustainable resource management, balancing the need for water resource utilisation with the preservation of ecosystems. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the long-term annual sustainable diversion limits (SDLs) set under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are not exceeded, and that enough water is available for the environment. APT is the maximum amount of water permitted to be taken for consumptive purposes each year, and has been enforced since July 2019\n\nA method for determining APT is part of each water resource plans (WRPs) developed by the Basin states under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007. When the method is applied over the Basin Plan reference period (1895–2009), the annual APT must be equal to or less than SDL.\n\nAn APT model is a major component of the APT calculation method. It is used to calculate the APT that would be expected in a year, given that year’s water availability and climatic conditions. APT is calculated at the end of each year and compared to actual take in that year, with the difference added to a public register of take. SDL compliance is tracked using the cumulative difference (from water year 2019–20).\n\nAPT models are configured using estimates of the river management and development (public and private infrastructure) conditions in a river system across the water resource plan period. These estimates include:\n\n• irrigated crop area and planting decisions\n\n• water entitlement holders’ distribution and use patterns\n\n• how storages are operated to supply water for consumption and the environment.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended APT model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under current conditions development and operation rules. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the WA public sector report 2014 - Measuring up is the employee perception survey (EPS). \r\n\r\nThe EPS captures employee views about factors affecting their workplace, such as leadership, communication, work/life balance and performance development. This information helps to understand organisational culture across the public sector and is essential in identifying areas for further consideration and acknowledging good practice. \r\n\r\nThe EPS is typically conducted in each public sector body with more than 20 employees once every five years. Different regional offices for the largest agencies, Department of Health and Department of Education, are surveyed every year. To improve the representativeness of the sample, entities are selected across a range of sizes and portfolios. However, care should be taken in interpreting the EPS results because the sample may not be entirely representative of the broader public sector.\r\n\r\nBetween February and June 2014, all employees in 21 public sector entities were asked to complete the survey (including two regional offices from the Department of Health and one from the Department of Education). The average response rate to the survey was 48%, with 6879 valid responses received.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2014.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant employees to access online or in hardcopy.\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2014 data.xls – individual responses to the EPS, with a question key and response key. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission EPS 2014 data.sav – individual responses to the EPS, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note that some variables have been removed or aggregated to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. \r\n\r\nFurther information about the EPS sample and summary results for 2014 are available in the [State of the WA public sector statistical bulletin 2014 - Measuring up](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/document/state-wa-public-sector-statistical-bulletin-2014-%E2%80%93-measuring).\r\n",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Ferry Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2020",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Katherine for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

Using the 20cm multibeam and a new digital filterbank array this survey will create a petabyte digital record of the sky that can be data mined in the future and used to search for relativistic binary and millisecond pulsars, RRATs, and extragalactic radio bursts. The survey should discover 100s of new millisecond and normal pulsars and help define the lower limit to pulsar periods, test theories of relativistic gravity, find transients and provide pulsars for gravitational wave detection.",

The sensors and satellite platforms contributing to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file header. The Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 1 day average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html for further information.",

This data is obtained from individuals sampled in obtaining data for the ACT Household Travel Survey. \n\nA trip is defined as the travel between two main activities, where a stop may constitute a change in transport mode. As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 ‘stops’ and two ‘trips’. \n\nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday. The main method of travel across a trip is used to classify trip types. The time of day is based on the mid-point of the start and arrival time of the trip. \nAM Peak: 8-9AM, PM Peak: 5-6PM",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of specialist attendances and associated Medicare benefits expenditure per person. Specialist attendance has been calculated with the total services from eligible claims (excluding any bulk-billed incentive items or other top-up items), divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) at the previous end of the financial year. Specialist expenditure has been calculated with the total benefit paid for eligible claims, divided by the ERP at the previous end of the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nSpecialist attendances are Medicare benefits-funded referred patient/doctor encounters, such as visits, consultations, and attendances by video conference, involving medical practitioners who have been recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for Medicare benefits purposes.\n\n\nExpenditure on GP/specialist attendances comprises MBS funding for patient/doctor encounters. Expenditure is reported unadjusted for inflation.\n\n\nBulk-billing is an arrangement in which a medical practitioner sends the bill directly to Medicare, so the patient pays nothing. Also known as direct billing.\n\n\nAge-standardisation allows fairer comparisons to be made between areas by accounting for variation in the age of populations within each area. This adjustment is important because the rates of many health conditions and health service use vary with age.\n\n",
