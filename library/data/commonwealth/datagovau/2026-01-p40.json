    "description": "This dataset was collected as part of the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE). The data shows business establishments with their trading name, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, location and CLUE block and small area allocation. The data covers the year period of 2007.\nA business establishment is defined as a \n\n\nCommercial occupant in a building\n\n\nSeparate land use\n\n\nAny permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\n\n\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\nFor more information please visit the City of Melbourne CLUE Portal and ABS ANZSIC Page.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has acquired the data through the City of Melbourne Open Data Portal.\n\n\nThe individual yearly tables have been extracted from the archived 2002-2017 tables.\n\n\nThe data in this table is a snapshot and not live.\n\n",

    "title": "Victoria - National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Map (PLUS)",
    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "We propose to monitor the bursts from the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst FRB 20240619D over six months using the Murriyang UWL receiver. The primary aim is to study the evolution of burst activity and polarization properties with frequency and time, and to discover any potential periodicity in the burst activity. These insights will enhance our understanding of the progenitor, emission physics, and the immediate magneto-ionic environment of FRB 20240619D, thereby informing the general FRB population. A total of 15 hours of observing between August and November 2024 resulted in over 1300 bursts detected using the UWL receiver. Some bursts exhibit complex spectro-temporal emission patterns. The burst rate, based on Murriyang and MeerKAT observations, indicates that the source was active until September 2nd, after which it became inactive. Given that two other repeating FRBs have exhibited periodic activity cycles, it is reasonable to expect that FRB 20240619D could become active again, making continued monitoring crucial. The UWL receiver's broad frequency coverage and sensitivity are essential for detecting many bursts and enabling simultaneous observations at different frequencies. This is important for understanding the burst activity evolution with time and frequency, spectral properties, and underlying emission mechanisms. The combination of sensitivity and wide bandwidth makes Murriyang the ideal telescope for monitoring this FRB. Results from these observations will be pivotal in understanding FRB 20240619D's place within the broader repeater population and its potential connection to broader FRB progenitor models.",

    "title": "The relative abundance (%) of planktonic foraminifera over time in core BAR 9403, located off the coast of Sumatra",
    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations. \n\nThe most obvious change in relative abundance in core BAR9403 (off the coast of Sumatra) is shown by sub-polar to transitional 'upwelling' species Ga. bulloides with abundances of 26% at approximately 14,000yrs BP and 22.7% during the Holocene. This is compared to the periods from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) where the relative abundance of Ga. bulloides is generally <10%. Gr. menardii, a tropical 'upwelling' species, also increases its relative abundance during MIS 2 from <8% during MIS 3 to a peak abundance of 16% at ~17,000yrs BP.",

    "description": "The Australian Priority Investment Approach to Welfare (PIA) policy initiative was established as part of the 2015-16 Budget, following a comprehensive review of Australia’s welfare system. The initiative uses data analysis to identify groups at risk of long-term welfare dependence. As part of the PIA, in September 2016, the Minister for Social Services announced a plan to allow limited public access to PIA data. \r\n\r\nA synthetic version of the PIA data has been created to provide access to administrative data for general users while maintaining the privacy of individuals. The synthetic PIA data relates to individuals who have made a claim for, are receiving or have received payments or services administered under social security law. This includes benefit types such as Aged Pension, Youth Allowance, Newstart and Disability Support Pension. The synthetic data contains a limited number of variables suitable for research, while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of individuals. The synthetic dataset has been created by applying a privacy-preserving algorithm on the original PIA data. This process results in each person’s true data being modified such that the overall group data very closely represents that of the original dataset, yet no one individual’s data remains in the synthetic dataset. That is, the dataset is a combination of synthetic records that, when combined, reflect the shape of the original dataset. \r\n\r\nThe synthetic PIA data contains a series of point-in-time quarterly snapshots dated from July 2001 to June 2015. This results in 56 separate quarters of administrative data. Each quarter includes 31 variables (listed below) that are consistent across all quarters. There are approximately 5 million individual records represented in each quarter. \r\n\r\nThe synthetic PIA data is available via free registration at Dataverse: https://dataverse.ada.edu.au/dataverse/pia_synthetic. \r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Peth (West) - Northbridge in WA with SA2 code 503021297, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This dataset contains hourly pedestrian counts since 2009 from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated on a monthly basis and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.The sensor_id column can be used to merge the data with the Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations dataset which details the location, status and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting pedestrian counts over time.Importants notes about this dataset:• Where no pedestrians have passed underneath a sensor during an hour, a count of zero will be shown for the sensor for that hour.• Directional readings are not included, though we hope to make this available later in the year. Directional readings are provided in the Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute) dataset.The Pedestrian Counting System helps to understand how people use different city locations at different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future. A representation of pedestrian volume which compares each location on any given day and time can be found in our Online Visualisation.Related datasets:Pedestrian Counting System – Past Hour (counts per minute)Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations",

    "description": "The Drainage Point Feature Class sits within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Assets Geodatabase.  The Drainage Point layer includes Stormwater Outlets, Stormwater Drain Pits, Retention Basins, Rubbish Traps, Grease Traps, Head Walls, and Oil Separators.   \n\nThe Assets Geodatabase is directly related to the Assets Maintenance System (AMS) which runs under SAP and contains similar fields, values and business rules. The Assets Geodatabase is the vehicle in which spatial assets are initially captured, edited and stored so that the features have coordinates and can be viewed spatially.   The data is collected across the entire NSW National Parks Estate and includes some off-park features for fire management, access and mapping purposes.  The spatial feature data is manually synchronised with the AMS.  The two systems run side by side and are linked by an ID field.  AMS is also set up to be used by other Department Planning, Industry &amp; Environment groups eg. Botanic Gardens and Parklands and previously Marine Parks.\n\nThe database includes the following asset Feature Class types - Barrier, Bridge or Elevated Walkway, Building, Communication Equipment, Crossing, Drainage Point, Environmental Monitoring Station, Extractive industry, Facility, Fence Handrail, Fire Management Zone, Gate, Hazards, Hydraulic Point, Hydraulic Storage Point, Hydraulic Valve, Irrigation System, Landing, Landing Strip, Lookout, Natural Feature, Other Structure, Parking Area, Pipe Channel Section, Power or Communication line, Power or Communication point, Sign, Step point, Stormwater Drainage Line, Surface, Survey Mark, Tower, Track Section, Treatment Disposal System, Visitor Area, Visitor Monitoring Point.\nDetailed documentation is available including:\n-  Data Dictionary (internal location - P:\\Corporate\\Tools\\Information\\Assets)\n-  Data Model\n-  Business Rules\n-  Functional Location and Naming Convention\n\nNote that for external supply the dataset is simplified with certain attribute fields being removed.  Those fields that have a name prefixed with \"d_\" contain descriptions extracted from the original geodatabase domains.",

Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._###\r\n\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is the national regulator of charities in Australia. \r\n\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits), need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary. \r\n\r\nThe ACNC maintains a register (known as the Charity Register), which contains information about charities. This dataset is a subset of the information available on the Charity Register.\r\n\r\nAdditional information for each charity (including governing documents and names of any Responsible Persons) can be found by searching the Charity Register at [acnc.gov.au/charity](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity).\r\n\r\nIn some situations, charities can apply to have some or all of their information withheld from the Charity Register.  If the ACNC has approved for the information to be withheld, it won’t appear on the Charity Register, or in this dataset. \r\n\r\nEach year, charities also lodge Annual Information Statements with the ACNC. These record further information about charities’ purposes, activities and operations for the year - the ACNC publishes datasets for each Annual Information Statement. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request by the charity to have their information withheld, but will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset. \r\n\r\nPlease use the attached explanatory notes to help with analysis of this dataset.",

Sometimes a charge may apply to an FOI request, and review mechanisms allow people to appeal decisions on an FOI request if they disagree.\r\n\r\nThe data below shows the number of requests received since 1982-83 and the amount of charges notified and collected. This data is sourced from data provided to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and previous FOI annual reports prepared each year from 1983 onwards. The 1982-83 data covers only seven months (December 1982 to June 1983), and the data about requests for personal information compared to other requests has only been collected from 2000-01 onwards.\r\n\r\nAgencies and ministers are also required to provide to the OAIC quarterly and annual statistical returns on FOI activity, review numbers and estimated costs. The returns data since 2011-12 is available here in CSV format and in a summary Excel spreadsheet. \r\n\r\nIn these files a column identified by either 'P' or 'personal' refers to FOI requests for predominantly personal information in relation to the criteria in row 1 above that heading. Similarly the adjacent column to the right identified by 'O' or 'other’ refers to all other FOI requests for that particular criteria. The column immediately adjacent, to the right of 'O' headed by 'T', contains the total of the 'P' and 'O' columns. \r\n\r\nThe Excel is optimised for readability and contains additional processing (such as applying a salary multiplier to agency estimated staff time data). Finally, the original survey questions for each year are included: each of the columns in the CSVs can be linked to a survey question asked that year. ",

The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2018 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

    "description": "Raster layer delineates the level of uncertainty depending on the data origin.\nGeneral Background: The National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) has been developed over the last 15 years from a variety of data sources. The commonwealth is reliant on states and territories to supply vegetation data, which is then collated into the NVIS. Because of varying levels of resources available to different regions, the data they are able to supply is of varying scale, age, origin and spatial mix. \nNVIS is widely used by various organisation including, researchers, NGO and governments, for a wide range of uses such as modelling, fire fuel loads and policy. To improve the interpretation of the NVIS dataset the Dept of the Environment & Energy has developed a suite of uncertainty layers and tools to facilitate the robust use of the NVIS.\nAim: to develop a raster Uncertainty layer that is intended to better describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS extant theme dataset.\nOutput: raster files scaled 0-1 that can be used for uncertainty, including data age, origin, scale and spatial mix. The layers can be added together to form one uncertainty layer. Python script/tools will also be provided so individuals can develop their own uncertainty layers and to be as transparent as possible.\nThe Uncertainty layers comprise 5 rasters, 1 composite and 5 individual layers:\n                 -      NVIS Uncertainty layer (composite of 4 below layers)\n                 -      Age: age of the NVIS data\n                 -      Origin: where the data came from\n                 -      Spatial mix: if the data is a mosaic\n                 -      Scale: scale that the data was mapped\nAge, scale, origin and spatial mix Information is supplied by the states and territories as part of the NVIS resupply process.\nThis dataset represents a scale of uncertainty in relation to data origin. Scale categories are below.\nTable 1.

    "description": "A polygon dataset showing critical industry Viticulture clusters in the Upper Hunter region. The viticulture cluster includes a highly integrated concentration of vineyards and associated wineries and tourism infrastructure in a rural landscape. The region's unique terrain and climate, its heritage vines and diversity of soil types all contribute to the specific quality and characteristics of grapes produced in the area, especially Hunter semillon and shiraz. Also of importance is the Hunter Valley wine tourism branding based on its natural environment and visual landscape attributes and its proximity to metropolitan areas. The mapped viticulture cluster includes the Pokolbin and Broke-Fordwich Geographic Indication (GI) sub-regions6 industry proposed GI subregions covering the Parish of Belford and localities of Lovedale and Mount View and part of the Upper Hunter Wine GI around Denman.\n Industry clusters that meet the following criteria:\n - there is a concentration of enterprises that provides clear development and marketing advantages and is based on an agricultural product;\n - the productive industries are interrelated;\n - it consists of a unique combination of factors such as location, infrastructure, heritage and natural resources;\n - it is of national and/or international importance;\n - it is an iconic industry that contributes to the region's identity; and\n - it is potentially substantially impacted by coal seam gas or mining proposals.",

DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.'

State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data.

    "title": "Geology and Geophysics of the  Offshore Maryborough,  Capricorn and Northern Tasman Basins: Results of AGSO Survey 91",
    "description": "The Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) completed a major marine multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection survey off southeast Queensland in December 1989 using RV Rig Seismic. The research cruise (AGSO Survey 91) was designed to investigate the structure, stratigraphy and evolution of offshore basins along this sector of the Australian continental margin. About half of the 2900 km of seismic data collected was recorded over the offshore Maryborough Basin; the remainder was collected over the Capricorn Basin and margins of the northern Tasman Basin. The survey included seismic ties to the only deep offshore wells in the region, Aquarius 1 and Capricorn 1A located in the northern Capricorn Basin. It was the first MCS survey shot in the region since 1974.\nSonobuoy refraction, gravity, magnetic and bathymetric data were also collected.\n\nThe Maryborough Basin developed in the earliest Triassic - mid Jurassic as an epicratonic downwarp, probably a foreland depression. Neocomian volcanism and rifting, perhaps generated by transtensional movements, led to a second phase of deposition that produced thick elastic shallow marine and deltaic sequences. Subsequent basin inversion in the mid Cretaceous produced major folding along northwest/NNW axes as well as normal and reverse faulting. Peneplanation following uplift has eroded up to several kilometres of section from the basin, leaving it as a remanent basin. The main causes of the uplift are believed to be (i) the mid Cretaceous deformation episode, (ii) rift flank uplift as the adjacent northern Tasman Sea opened (-63 Ma ago), and (iii) rise of the Eastern Highlands in the Late Cretaceous - Cainozoic due to crustal underplating associated with detachment\nfaulting and transit over mantle plumes.\n\nUp to 5 km of the Early Cretaceous Maryborough Formation (shallow marine elastics) and Burrum Coal Measures are preserved in a NNW-trending syncline beneath the western side of Hervey Bay, just off the coast northeast of Bundaberg. Depth to basement may be as much as 9-10 km. No major anticlines in the Early Cretaceous units are present beneath Hervey Bay. However, small culminations may exist in the more flat-lying strata of the basin deep northeast of Bundaberg.\n\nReinterpretation of onshore seismic data in the Maryborough Basin has provided new insight into the structural configuration of this part of the basin. \n\nSurvey 91 established that the Maryborough Basin does extend beneath the continental shelf southeast of Fraser Island. The section is folded and faulted, with broad anticlinal structures present. Seismic data quality in the Cretaceous and older section is poor in this area, perhaps a consequence low acoustic impedance contrast (?tight formations). Much of the shelf is underlain by about 2.0 s twt (-4 km) of Maryborough Basin section. A major syncline in Wide Bay contains up to 5 km of Early Cretaceous sediments. Basement here may lie at 8-9 km depth.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "title": "Tide gauge and water temperature data from three moorings in Jervis Bay: 05/12/88 - 11/01/89",
    "description": "Three pressure-sensor water-level recorders were deployed, at HMAS Creswell (Orange mooring), off Bowen Island (Black mooring) and off Point Perpendicular (Yellow mooring). These sensors recorded water level and water temperature at 10 minute intervals commencing on 05/12/88 and  finishing on 11/01/89. \n\nThe Yellow mooring line at Point Perpendicular broke during recovery, and was not recovered by divers until the 08/02/89. This tide gauge was (unintentionally) deployed on rocky steep sloping banks. The water level record revealed that the instrument had slipped down the steep banks on several occasions producing instantaneous changes in water level of up to 1m. These were removed from the data record. \n\nThe Black mooring was located at 35.1117 S 150.767 E with a sensor depth of 11m. \nThe Orange mooring was located at 35.1206 S 150.704 E with a sensor depth of 13m. \nThe Yellow mooring was located at 35.0967 S 150.802 E with a sensor depth of 20m.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 06bf0e30-2ae3-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "The IMOS AUV Facility has an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle called Sirius (IMOS platform code:SIRIUS), capable of undertaking high resolution geo-referenced survey work. This platform is a modified version of a mid-size robotic vehicle called Seabed built at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. \n\nThis class of AUV has been designed specifically for relatively low speed, high resolution imaging and is passively stable in pitch and roll. The submersible is equipped with a full suite of oceanographic sensors including a high resolution stereo camera pair and strobes, multibeam sonar, a depth sensor (Paroscientific), Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) including a compass with integrated roll and pitch sensors, Ultra Short Baseline Acoustic Positioning System (USBL), forward looking obstacle avoidance sonar, a conductivity/temperature sensor (Sea-Bird SBE 37-SIP) and combination fluorometer/scattering sensor (WET Labs ECO Puck Triplet Sensor) to measure chlorophyll-a, CDOM and turbidity. The vehicle is controlled by an on-board, PC-104 based computing platform which is used for sampling sensor information and running the vehicle's low level control algorithms.\n\nThe vehicle has repeatedly demonstrated its capacity to collect high resolution, near bottom imagery and multibeam data that has been used to study novel mapping algorithms, techniques for automated image classification and to generate high resolution three dimensional sea floor models facilitating the detailed study of benthic habitats.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 1, 2 and 5 who were fully immunised. Fully immunised means a child has received the scheduled vaccinations according to age for hepatitis B (hepB); diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (DTPa); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); polio (IPV); pneumococcal, meningococcal C, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), and varicella. The data spans the years of 2012-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data was sourced from the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), which is administered by the Australian Government Department of Human Services. The AIR is a national register that records immunisations given to children to help parents and guardians keep track of their children’s immunisations.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Immunisation rates for children in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe AIR may underestimate coverage due to incomplete submission of immunisation records or the inclusion of children who no longer reside in an area but have not been updated on the register.\n\n\nChildren identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander in this report reflect the indigenous status recorded on the AIR, which is based on Medicare enrolment records.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"NP\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nRows assigned a \"#\" in the \"Interpret with Caution\" column should be interpreted with caution as these area’s eligible population is between 26 and 100 registered children.\n\n",

    "description": "Landsat satellite imagery is used to derive woody vegetation extent products that discriminate between forest, sparse woody and non-woody land cover across a time series from 1988 to 2023. A forest is defined as woody vegetation with a minimum 20 per cent canopy cover, at least 2 metres high and a minimum area of 0.2 hectares. Note that this product is not filtered to the 0.2ha criteria for forest to allow for flexibility in different use cases. Filtering to remove areas less than 0.2ha is undertaken in downstream processing for the purposes of Australia's National Inventory Reports. Sparse woody is defined as woody vegetation with a canopy cover between 5-19 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe three-class classification (forest, sparse woody and non-woody) supersedes the two-class classification (forest and non-forest) from 2016. The new classification is produced using the same approach in terms of time series processing (conditional probability networks) as the two-class method, to detect woody vegetation cover. The three-class algorithm better encompasses the different types of woody vegetation across the Australian landscape.\r\n\r\nUnlike previous versions of the National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation data releases where 35 tiles have been released as part of the product, only the 25 southern tiles have been supplied in this release. The 10 northern tiles will be released as a separate product release, expected later in the financial year, as these are subject to a methodological change associated with the adoption of the Sentinel sensor and will be supplied at a different resolution. Please see the National Forest and Sparse Woody Vegetation data metadata pdf (Version 8.0 - 2023 release) for more information.",

    "description": "Radial data files contain radial components of sea surface parameters measured by HF ocean radars operated by Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network (ACORN), a facility of Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS).\n\nRegardless of the radar system (WERA or SeaSonde), the primary product is the radial component of the sea surface current along a line between the radar station and a point on the sea surface.  By combining radials measured at two stations surface current vectors can be constructed.  These surface current vectors can then be used to study tides, wind-driven currents and perform lagrangian particle tracking.\n\nA snap-shot of the radial surface current map is produced by a radar station every 10 min (WERA) or 1 h (SeaSonde).  These data are uploaded to the IMOS archive in real-time.  Real-time data are produced by the manufacturer of the radar station and no quality control flags are assigned by either the manufacturer or ACORN at this stage.\n\nEach real-time radial file contains a set of standard metadata fields, such as radar system type, operating frequency and bandwidth.  Other metadata fields describe radar system type-specific parameters.  Radial file metadata fields are described in a separate ACORN data document.\n\nIn addition, WERA radar systems provide the real-time heights of left and right bragg peaks, from which the wind direction can be inferred, and an estimate of the significant wave height.  These quantities are not quality controlled because they are output from the manufacturer's software without the detail necessary for ACORN to assign a quality control label.",

    "title": "Biological records for National Park islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef (NERP TE 9.3, JCU)",
    "description": "The database contains native and alien species records for National Park islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Attributes for each record include information on abundance, life history traits, habitat requirements, limitations of source, and relevant species information from government bodies including EPBC and NCA listings. Basic interaction information among species (alien vs. native) is also recorded. This dataset also has basic information about the islands such as area, location, and regional ecosystem types present on the island. \n\nOne shapefile, Island Threats, contains information on the presence and absence of a number of animals and plant threats on islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef as elicited from experts. Each spatially explicit point represents data for a given species on a specific island.\n\nAnother shapefile, Regional Ecosystems, contains information on the various Queensland Herbarium regional ecosystem (RE) types extracted for National Park Islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Individual polygons represent an area of a specific RE type.\n\nThe last shapefile, Features on Islands, contains information on the abundance of a number of native animals on islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef as elicited from experts. Each spatially explicit point represents data for a given species on a specific island.\n\nThis database was created as a basis for the decision support tool being developed for NERP 9.3. The database is the most complete dataset for the islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef at the time of release. \n\n\nMethod:\n\nDatabase:\nA comprehensive literature review was conducted for all published and ¿grey¿ source material containing biological records for National Park islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Unpublished species records were also compiled from sources such as WildNet, the Queensland Herbarium, and personal communications. For a given source, each species on each island received a unique record. Records were structured within the database so that each record remained associated with its source, allowing revisitation in order to review records within their original context. Attributes relevant to each record were extracted from source, including information on habitat requirements, life history traits, abundance, and source limitations e.g. incomplete sampling of island area. Additional attributes for each record were extracted from the Australian and Queensland government websites, including information on EBPC and CNA listings, and endemicity. \n\nIsland Threats:\nExperts who frequent the islands were consulted as to whether they believed a given threat was present or absent on the islands. These data were input into the associated access database Island_database.accbd, and then transformed into the point based shapefile.\n\nThe following is the list of threats considered in this dataset.\n* African Big Headed Ant\n* Black Rat\n* Brushtail Possum\n* Cane toad\n* Climbing Asparagus\n* Cobblers Peg\n* Red Junglefowl\n* Dwarf Poinsettia\n* Eastern Grey Kangaroo\n* Feral Cat\n* Feral Cattle\n* Feral Goat\n* Feral Horse\n* Feral Pig\n* Fox\n* Green Panic\n* Groundsel\n* Guinea Grass\n* Hog Deer\n* House Mouse\n* House Sparrow\n* Lantana\n* Morning Glory\n* Mother of Millions\n* Nightshade\n* Noogoora Burr\n* Periwinkle\n* Rubbervine\n* Singapore Daisy\n* Sisal Hemp\n* Soft Scale\n* Yellow Guava\n* Molasses Grass\n* Mossman River Grass\n* Mother-in-Law Tongue\n* Pink Periwinkle\n* Prickly Pear\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\nShape files of regional ecosystem (RE) types and National Park Islands in the Southern GBR were obtained from Queensland Herbarium (in 2014). These data were rearranged and merged to create a single shape file.\n\neAtlas editor note: It was noticed when mapping this shapefile that many of the polygon regions had multiple overlapping features, sometimes consisting of duplicates, and sometimes containing multiple RE codes. The cause of this in the dataset is unknown. A map of these overlaps was made by rendering them as black transparent polygons. This map is available in the download section of this metadata record. \n\nFeatures on Islands:\nExperts who frequent the islands were consulted as to the maximum and minimum number of individuals/pairs of native species on the islands. On each island there are multiple estimates for each species, one from each expert.\n\nThe following is the set of species that are included in this dataset.\n* Anous minutus (Black noddy)\n* Anous stolidus (Brown noddy)\n* Burhinus grallarius (Bush stone-curlew)\n* Calyptorhynchus lathami (Glossy black cockatoo)\n* Caretta caretta (Loggerhead sea turtle)\n* Charadrius ruficapillus (Red-capped plover)\n* Chelonia mydas (Green sea turtle)\n* Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae (Silver gull)\n* Egretta sacra (Pacific reef heron)\n* Epthianura crocea (Yellow chat)\n* Esacus magnirostris (Beach stone-curlew)\n* Falco peregrinus (Peregrine falcon)\n* Fregata ariel (Lesser frigatebird)\n* Fregata minor (Great frigatebird)\n* Gallirallus philippensis (Buff-banded rail)\n* Haematopus fuliginosus (Sooty oystercatcher)\n* Haematopus longirostris (Pied oystercatcher)\n* Haliaeetus leucogaster (White-bellied sea eagle)\n* Haliastur indus (Brahminy kite)\n* Hydroprogne caspia (Caspian tern)\n* Megapodius reinwardt (Orange-footed scrubfowl)\n* Natator depressus (Flatback sea turtle)\n* Onychoprion anaethetus (Bridled tern)\n* Onychoprion fuscata (Sooty tern)\n* Pandion cristatus (Osprey)\n* Phaethon rubricauda (Red-tailed tropicbird)\n* Phalacrocorax varius (Australian pied cormorant)\n* Phascolarctos cinereus (Koala)\n* Pluvialis squatarola (Grey plover)\n* Ptilinopus regina (Rose-crowned fruit dove)\n* Sterna dougallii (Roseate tern)\n* Sterna sumatrana (Black-naped tern)\n* Sternula albifrons (Little tern)\n* Sula dactylatra (Masked booby)\n* Sula leucogaster (Brown booby)\n* Thalasseus bengalensis (Lesser crested tern)\n* Thalasseus bergii (Greater crested tern)\n* Tringa brevipes (Grey-tailed tattler)\n* Xeromys myoides (False Water Rat)\n* Zosterops lateralis (Silvereye)\n\nFurther information on the methodology can be found in the final report for this project: Pressey, R., Wenger, A. (2015) Prioritising Management Actions for Great Barrier Reef Islands.\nhttp://www.nerptropical.edu.au/sites/default/files/publications/files/NERP9.3_final_report-FINAL-Complete.pdf\n\n\nLimitations of the data:\n\nDatabase:\nAbundance data varies over different units of time. For example in the ¿Total¿ column, 100 might indicate 100 individuals observed in a single survey, or over repeated visits to an island. The units of observation are maintained in the ¿Abundance¿ column, e.g. 100/birds January 2000. Values in the ¿Total¿ column should be interpreted in conjunction with the ¿Abundance¿ column.\nWe have removed any data for which we have data sharing agreements. Therefore, the database used for this project is much more comprehensive than we are able to submit.  \n\nIsland Threats:\nThe shapefile is limited to presence or absences only for a focal number of threats on targeted islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. There is no data on the number of individuals or the extent of the species on the islands. The presence or absence of a species is based on general consensus by experts. If there is no point for a given island/threat pair then the presence of absence of the species on that island is unknown.\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\nThe shapefile is limited to National Park Islands in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. Information on RE types on other islands exists but was not the focus of this work. In some cases multiple polygons of the same shape and size exist for the same region of an island. Here a number of RE types were recorded within the polygon/area but the exact spatial extent of the RE is unknown, only the percentage of the polygon/area that the RE covers.\n\nFeatures on Islands:\nThe shapefile is limited to best guess estimates of the maximum and minimum number of individuals/pairs of a select number of native species on an island. The extent of the species on the island and how the population has changed over time are not known.\n\n\nFormat:\n\nIsland_database.accbd\nFormat: Access database.\nThis database contains a number of tables which are categorised according to their name:\n1 \"Records:¿\" are record tables where each row is a specific record relating to the focus of the table.\n2 \"Attributes:¿\" are attribute tables which have information specific to each category (e.g. islands, native animals, regional ecosystems. Attribute tables typically list the primary keys for each category which link to the records tables. \n3 \"Stats:¿\" are tables that contain basic statistics on records tables. These have been created using queries and will have queries with associated query names. \n4 \"Queries:¿\" are tables that have been created from queries (other than specific statistics queries) run on records/attributes tables and will have queries with associated query names. \n\nThis database also contains a number of queries which are based on the records/attributes tables, a most of which are linked to stats or queries tables of an associated name. See the ¿Design View¿ of any of the tables for more information, in particular for column/field descriptions. \n\nIsland Threats:\nThreats_on_Islands.*, GIS shape file \nProjected Coordinate System: GDA_1994_MGA_Zone_55\nProjection: Transverse_Mercator\n\n\nData dictionary:\n\n- Isl_name: name of the island where the record occurs\n- LONG: x co-ordinate location of the island (descimal degrees)\n- LAT: y co-ordinate location of the island (descimal degrees)\n- Threat: Common name of the threat\n- Interactio: Whether the threat species is present (1) or absent (0) on the island\n\nRegional Ecosystems:\n\nRE_on_NP_Islands.*, GIS shape file\nProjected Coordinate System: GDA_1994_MGA_Zone_55\nProjection: Transverse_Mercator\n\n\nData dictionary:\n\n- RE_type: Code for the regional ecosystem type, see associated access database Island_database.accbd for RE type descriptions\n- PC_of_Poly: percentage of the polygon that the RE covers.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2003 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "title": "Petroleum generation and migration modelling for the Capel and Faust basins, eastern offshore Australia - GNS Science Report 2011-22",
    "description": "The Capel and Faust basins, located on the Lord Howe Rise in water depths between 1,300 m and 2,500 m, were the focus of a series of marine surveys by Geoscience Australia in 2006 and 2007. Their interpretation of high-fold 2D seismic reflection, gravity and magnetic, multi-beam bathymetry, sonobuoy refraction, heat flow and geological sample data suggested the basins have petroleum potential. Analysis of petroleum generation and migration, based on structural maps, lithological and other data supplied by Geoscience Australia, is the focus of this study. Basin models predict that most of the deeper depocentres in the Capel and Faust basins, mapped as containing Jurassic-aged pre-rift and Cretaceous-aged syn-rift source rocks, have the potential to expel oil and gas, and charge nearby syn-rift and post-rift reservoir formations from Cretaceous time to the present day.\nMulti-1D thermal and petroleum generation models predict: \n - Pre-rift (215 - 165 Ma) and Syn-rift 1 (130 - 100 Ma) megasequences within the deeper depocentres are within the oil or gas generation window; \n - Based on the expected presence of petroleum-generative coaly source rocks, total oil and gas expulsion from the major depocentres exceeds 5 MMbbl/km2 and 25 Bcf/km2 respectively from the Pre-rift source rocks, and 20 MMbbl/km2, and 300 Bcf/km2 respectively from the Syn-rift 1 source rocks. In terms of timing, 80% of total hydrocarbon expulsion is predicted by the end of the Eocene, with maximum expulsion taking place between the Late Cretaceous and the Late Eocene (c. 68-36 Ma);\n  - A significant increase in paleo-water depth in late Cenozoic time has supressed further heating related to post-Eocene burial. However, modelling predicts post-Eocene expulsion of oil and gas may have been partly enhanced by post-rift magmatism.\nIn this study total expelled oil and gas volumes are 'migrated across' mapped horizons to assess charge of and fill-spill relationships between structural traps. This map-based charge modelling assumes certain reservoir properties with no migration losses and predicts that: \n - Accumulations within potential reservoir facies, such as deltaic, shoreline and turbidite sandstones of the lower Post-rift unit (70 - 68 Ma) are dominantly gas with volumes generally about 5 to 9 Tcf at burial depths of 400 - 700 m; \n - Accumulations within similar sandstones of the upper Syn-rift 2 unit are mixed oil and gas (about 2 to 3 billion bbl oil and 10 Tcf gas) at burial depths of 400 - 800 m; \n - Similar accumulations are present in the lower Syn-rift 2 and Syn-rift 1 fluvial sands; \n - Most of the mapped structural traps are buried to relatively shallow depths and seal effectiveness for containment must therefore be a significant risk. Deeper structures and stratigraphic plays may further contribute to the petroleum potential in the basins.\nThe model presented here illustrates the potential for petroleum charge of structural traps in the Capel and Faust basins and highlights the risks associated with source rock distribution and type, reservoir distribution and quality, and seal effectiveness. Volumetric and charge assessments could be further refined using higher density seismic data and appropriate rock property data for reservoir and seal rocks in combination with 3D modelling.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "title": "Hanley’s River Snail Indicative Distribution in NSW",
    "description": "Hanley’s River Snail is a freshwater snail that was once common and\nwidespread in the Murray River catchment, including the Lachlan\nand Murrumbidgee Rivers. In the 1940s, the species was so\ncommon it supported collections of thousands of individuals for\nresearch purposes. However populations rapidly declined in the\n1960s and 1970s and by the 1980s they were reduced to a handful\nof locations, probably as a result of weir building and other activities\nassociated with river flow management. They are now virtually\nextinct throughout their natural range and living specimens have only\nbeen found from within three locations in NSW. They are a critically\nendangered species - www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/threatenedspecies/threatened-species-list/critically/hanleys-river-snail\nThe methods used to create the predicted current distribution of\nHanley’s River Snail are described fully in: NSW Department of\nPrimary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community Status 2015 – Final\nReport. \nAll available records of the species were collated and assessed for\naccuracy. For current distribution, only records after 1 January 1994\nwere used. Within the framework of the Australian Hydrological\nGeospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network, the records were\nassociated with attributes from the National Environmental Stream\nAttributes Database and River Styles® geomorphology. The\nAustralian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology\nnetwork (Geofabric) is a fully connected and directed stream network based a 9 second DEM. It allocates a unique stream segment\nnumber to each river reach in Australia. The Environmental\nAttributes Database is a set of lookup tables supplying attributes\ndescribing the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the\nstream and catchment environment that was developed by the\nAustralian National University (ANU) in 2011 and updated in 2012.\nThe data is supplied as part of the supplementary Geofabric\nproducts which is associated with the 9 second DEM derived\nstreams and the National Catchment Boundaries based on 250k\nscale stream network. 30 Stream variables were assessed for the\nmodelling.\nRiver Styles® provides a high resolution categorical classification of\nriver character within a nested hierarchy of criteria based on valley\nsetting, channel planform, geomorphic units, and bed material. The\nNSW Office of Water compiled a spatial dataset of River Styles®\nclassifications for a large number of the waterways of NSW. From 65\nRiver Style® categories we generated two new fields representing\nPlanform (34 categories) and Substratum (8 categories) for each\nstream segment. River Style® planform and substratum categories\nwere then assigned to each Geofabric segment.\nMaxEnt 3.3.3 is a widely used species distribution modelling program\nthat utilises presence records to generate probabilities of occurrence\nbased on a suite of environmental variables quantified across the\narea of interest. It was used to model the current geographic\ndistribution of each listed threatened freshwater aquatic species or\npopulation. We utilised logistic output to plot the predicted\ndistribution of each species. This output equates to a probability that\nthe species will be observed in each river reach, given the\nenvironmental conditions that exist there relative to the\nenvironmental conditions where the species is known to occur. For\nthis mapping, above 33% probability was considered predicted\npresence. Only stream segments with a modelled average daily flow\nof more than five megalitres were selected for output. In addition,\npredicted separate populations were connected by manual\ninterpretation. The predicted values for each river reach were\nconverted from the Geofabric framework to the higher resolution\n2013 NSW Strahler Stream Order Hydroline.",

    "description": "These data sets include Salinity, Carbon, Alkalinity, Oxygen and Nutrients (Silicate, Ammonium, Nitrite/Nitrate, Phosphate) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network - National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. \nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) from small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "This point dataset shows the position and names of Recreational Areas within the State of Queensland. This dataset has been derived from the Queensland Recreation Areas (Polygon) 2016 dataset by calculating each polygon's centroid. Recreational areas include: - civic Squares, gardens, golf gourses, miscellaneous areas (e.g. basketball courts, bowling clubs, caravan parks, netball courts, tennis courts, velodromes , ovals, parks, race courses, racetracks, rifle Ranges, showgrounds, zoos). This purpose of this dataset is to provide the position and names of Recreational Areas for use in Land Administration,Topographic Mapping and in the production of Navigational and Web Based Mapping applications. Additional Information: This data has been compiled from numerous sources to produce a state wide coverage with the boundaries aligned in most cases with the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB)or captured from the best available imagery with an attribute within the data describing the source and reliability. Source data include: Queensland digital cadastral database, Queensland regional mapping, Queensland orthophotography, satellite imagery, Geoscience Australia, community and government websites. The horizontal positional accuracy of the data that has been used to compile this dataset is as follows: Orthophotography +/- 1m, Satellite Imagery +/- 2.5m. The horizontal positional accuracy of DCDB is dependent on the accuracy of the DCDB at the time of extraction.Initially for whole of state data capture, the location of the features was sourced from existing government topographic maps, regional maps and photogrammetric data. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where necessary. The location and names of parks were extracted from the Queensland Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB). The data had been loaded into the DCDB from a \"Park and Canal Name Attribute Project\" commenced in September 1999 for data acquisition for PSMA. For golf courses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Golf Union Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For rifle ranges, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Rifle Association Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. For racecourses, the address of the feature was sourced from the Queensland Racing Website. The address was then used to identify the Lot/Plan description in the DCDB that formed the extent of the feature. The features were validated against current orthophotography and satellite imagery and modified where the spatial accuracy of the DCDB was outside 25k topographic data specifications. Features for ongoing data capture are sourced from government and community websites and National Park maps and their location is digitized from current orthophotography and satellite imagery. Additional data is supplied by Geoscience Australia as part of their 25K large scale data capture and commitment to the National Topographic Information Coordination Initiative (NTICI). In most cases these features have been identified through fieldwork by Geoscience Australia staff. ",

    "description": "Land and emergency management agencies in Australia and\noverseas recognise the importance of an access network to support bushfire\nmanagement activities. Ground and aerial access provides a platform for fire\nreduction and readiness activities and provides opportunities to contain fires\nbefore they escalate into major fires that could otherwise incur significant\ncosts and potentially significant losses to community, cultural and\nenvironmental values.\n\n\nFire access within the ACT consists of a network of roads,\ntracks and trails that support fire prevention, readiness and response\nactivities. The identification and maintenance of fire access is an integral\nelement of fire management across the ACT.\n\n\nAccess management is divided into four areas :\n\n\n1.     maintenance\n\n\n2.     upgrade\n\n\n3.     construction\n\n\n4.     vegetation removal.\n\n\nACT PCS Fire Management Unit currently manage and maintain\napproximately 3,218 kilometres of roads and fire trails within the ACT. The\nclassification of fire roads, tracks and trails is performance based to provide\nclear guidance to response agencies during incidents.\n\n\nGround access is defined in four classes :\n\n\n1.     Float road – an access road\nor trail accessible to a low loader float carrying a large bulldozer or other\nheavy equipment.\n\n\n2.     Tanker road – a fire trail\nof strategic importance accessible to a heavy tanker and a tipper carrying a\nsmall bulldozer.\n\n\n3.     Light unit trail – a fire\ntrail accessible at minimum standard for a light unit.\n\n\n4.     Dormant fire trail – a trail\nthat has been deliberately closed or not maintained and can be quickly\nre-opened with minimal works.\n\n\nThe objective of ground access works are to upgrade and\nmaintain road pavements within the parks and reserves of the ACT to the above\nfour classes standard under the current Bushfire Operational Plan. Many areas\nrequire ongoing general maintenance or upgrading to an appropriate standard.\nThis is done principally to provide reliable access for operational\nrequirements and for fire suppression activities in the event of a wildfire\nthat may threaten the ACT.\n\n\nVegetation removal work is conducted by mechanical mulchers\nthat reduce vegetation on roads and trails that impede access for operational\nand fire suppression requirements identified under the current Bushfire\nOperational Plan. The Parks and Conservation Service Fire Management Unit also\ncommit a number of other contracted resources (graders, trucks, rollers,\nexcavators and backhoes etc) to conduct daily scheduled maintenance as well as\nupgrade and construction services on a yearly basis within the ACT.\n\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.actmapi.act.gov.au/\">Bushfire Map</a> shows the Environment, Planning &amp;\nSustainable Development  Directorate (EPSDD) Bushfire Operations Plan\n(BOP) for the current financial year.\n\n\nThe EPSDD BOP is derived from the 5-year Regional Fire\nManagement Plans, which can also be viewed on this site. The EPSDD BOP details\nthe specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and\ninfrastructure activities proposed to be undertaken in the ACT in the current\nfinancial; year, in accordance with the Strategic Bushfire Management Plan\n(SBMP).\n\n\n",

The data spans the months of 2010 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who consume more than two standard drinks per day on average. Lifetime risky alcohol consumption is defined as those adults who consume more than two standard drinks per day on average, thereby increasing their lifetime risk. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN106 should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates have a relative standard error of 25% to 50%.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

Perhaps more importantly, the night time in-person spend is also an indicator of people's participation in activities outside their homes at night, which supports social cohesion and personal wellbeing. \nThe data is sourced from NSW Government Customer Experience Survey (CXS).\nThe following caveats apply to the value of the night-time economy measures:\n\n\n'Spend data' is provided by Westpac based on transactions captured by card payment terminals, adjusted for its market coverage and client profiles to reflect the population total.

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

Settlement Date uses a combination of either arrival date or grant date depending on where the settler was when their current SDB visa was granted. If a settler was offshore when their current SDB visa was granted then arrival date is used. If a settler was onshore when their current SDB visa was granted then visa grant date is used. SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Home Affairs, other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Government Data Portal.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere the recorded number of settlers is less than 5, the data has been set to null for confidentiality.\n\n\nSettlers which do not have a recorded LGA have been removed from the data.\n\n",

Data has been collected using a standard monitoring protocol outlined in 'Assessing estuary ecosystem health: Sampling, data analysis and reporting protocols. NSW Natural Resources Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Program', most recently updated in 2016 and available on the NSW environment website. The data has been used to monitor the aquatic ecosystem condition of over 160 estuaries in NSW over time. Adopting the principles of the National Water Quality Management Framework, the data has been used to develop NSW specific guideline values for a range of physico-chemical water quality indicators for each estuary type. This allows comparison of observed data to these guidelines to assess condition of any estuary in NSW. As part of the Marine Estate Management Strategy Implementation Plan Stage 1, a NSW water quality database has been developed, where this data is now stored. Water quality monitoring in NSW estuaries is ongoing, and updated data will be made available routinely.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2021 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au.

Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2. Although every effort was made to remove any erroneous polygons (such as street lights, back yard fences and powerlines), there are likely to be some errors remaining.\nCreative Commons by Attribution (CCBY) 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory).

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of people who delayed or did not see a GP when needed due to cost in the last 12 months. The data spans the financial years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. The claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim has been processed by the Department of Human Services. Data are reported for claims processed between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The data also contains the results from the ABS 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey.\nThe Patients' spending on Medicare Services data accompanies the Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services 2016-17 Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patients' out-of-pocket spending on Medicare services Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data is based on the patient's Medicare enrolment postcode, not where they received the health care service. Most peoples' Medicare enrolment postcode will be their residential postcode.\n\n\nThe data excludes pathology and imaging tests conducted in a hospital, and any dental imaging tests.\n\n\nIf respondents sought clarification on the definition of a medical specialist, interviewers were instructed to advise that medical specialists provide services which are covered, at least in part, by Medicare (e.g. dermatologists, cardiologists, neurologists and gynaecologists).\n\n\nImaging tests or diagnostic imaging include all tests that produce images or pictures of the inside of the body in order to diagnose diseases. Tests involve the use of radiant energy, including x-rays, sound waves, radio waves, and radioactive waves and particles that are recorded by photographic films or other types of detectors.\n\n\nPathology tests refer to laboratory tests that include analysis of specimens such as urine and blood in order to diagnose disease.\n\n\nThe survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "Monitoring Flying Fox Habitat  \n \nSensors have been installed at locations across Geelong’s Eastern Gardens to monitor the habitat and behaviour of the grey-headed flying fox. The sensors have been placed in five radiata pine trees to record temperature and humidity patterns across the gardens and between preferred roosting sites.  \n \nThere is a significant population of grey-headed flying foxes in the gardens, yet total population numbers are rapidly declining, making this important native pollinator a vulnerable species. Loss of habitat and heat-stress are two factors attributed to this decline. Understanding how climate change is impacting their behaviour and roosting patterns over time will help to inform protection measures across the country.  ",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems. The data spans the months of 2005 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "Temperate WA (Kendrick, Babcock, Smale): A cruise was undertaken in collaboration with the University of Western Australian and CSIRO to document benthic assemblages on temperate reefs off the coast of Western Australia in April, 2012. This cruise was the third in a 3 year series of IMOS AUV Facility cruises intended to establish a benthic habitat timeseries along the Eastern and Western coasts of Australia. These surveys have been repeated annually for three years. Surveys were conducted off Rottnest Island, Jurien Bay, and the Abrolhos Islands. Sites were surveyed at each location spanning three depths (15 m, 25 m, 40 m), both inside and outside MPAs, with three 25 m x 25 m full photo coverage quadrants devoted to each site. Site locations targeted kelp beds and were provided by the science party. The locations of individual quadrants within each site were selected to repeat surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011. Additional scientific operations carried out during the cruise consisted of CTD casts.",

    "description": "This dashboard is a key resource developed through the East Coast Flood Recovery Program to provide access to water quality data. The East Coast Flood Recovery Program 2023-2024 was a comprehensive program supporting long-term recovery from the 2022 floods by monitoring water quality in disaster-declared catchments along the East Coast of NSW. This dashboard presents data for three regions: The North Coast, Mid-Coast and Hawkesbury-Nepean River. The data available on the dashboard collates multiple water quality parameters from thousands of samples collected throughout the project, including water clarity (turbidity), algae (chlorophyll-a), nutrients and bacteria. This data has been collected through manual field sampling by the project team and in real-time via telemetered water quality loggers (2 land-based sites and 6 smart buoys).",

    "description": "Plant community structure and observed inundation in vegetation plots collected as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (CEWH) Flow-MER program in the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\nData provided by Flow-MER program Selected Area teams: Junction of the Warrego and Darling Rivers and Gwydir river system (University of New England), Lachlan river system (University of Canberra), Murrumbidgee river system (Charles Sturt University), Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system (Charles Sturt University), Goulburn River (Arthur Rylah Institute).\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH (2024) Vegetation Community Structure.

    "title": "Potential displacement of commercial fisheries by a Commonwealth marine reserve zoning scheme",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n\r\n The Government commissioned an independent review of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves that were originally proclaimed in November 2012. The Department of the Environment commissioned ABARES to assess potential displacement of commercial fishing by alternative marine reserve designs and zoning options considered by the Bioregional Advisory Panel. The report details potential displacement by the network proclaimed in 2012 and the network recommended by the Panel in 2015. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  • The potential impact of the Panel recommended (2015) zoning on commercial fisheries in the regions is relatively small, compared with the total gross value of production (GVP) from all wild capture fisheries. However, while much of the total impact is diffuse, some of the potential impact is concentrated in particular fisheries, entitlement holders and towns. \r\n• The Panel recommended (2015) zoning would potentially displace an estimated annual average 587.6 t of catch, with an annual average GVP of $4.51 million. This is less than the proclaimed network (2012), which would displace 1032 t of catch, with a GVP of $8.21 million. \r\n• For individual entitlements, there are a large number for which the potential impacts of the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning are relatively low (more than 700 entitlements with less than $2500 displaced per year) and a small number of entitlements for which the potential impacts are higher (17 entitlements over $50 000). The largest displacement from one entitlement was $164 000. These figures do not include South Australian entitlements because ABARES did not receive fisheries data at this scale for South Australian fisheries. A single business unit may hold multiple entitlements and so the impact on a business unit would be the sum of the individual entitlement impacts. \r\n• At the fishery level, the largest GVP displacements from the Panel-recommended (2015) zoning would be from the Western Australian West Coast Rock Lobster Fishery ($823 000), Commonwealth Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery ($585 800) and Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery ($488 200). \r\n• In terms of the proportion of GVP from the entire fishery, the largest displacements would be from the Commonwealth Coral Sea Fishery (71.2 per cent of fishery GVP), Western Australian North Coast Shark Fishery (33.9 per cent) and the Western Australian South West Trawl Fishery (13.2 per cent). \r\n• Towns with the highest potential GVP displacement were Mooloolaba in Queensland ($515 100), Geraldton in Western Australia ($449 200) and Fremantle in Western Australia ($406 300). \r\n• The estimated net economic impact of the Panel-recommended network would be reduced regional economic activity of $7.9 million in the short term. Potential short term employment impacts were separately estimated at 18 total jobs (estimate derived from previous economic modelling) and 49 jobs (estimate derived from previous surveys of fishers). Changes in economic activity at the state / territory level are expected to be negligible in terms of the size of the economies. These estimates have been made by rescaling previous economic modelling and survey results (from 2012); ABARES was not commissioned to undertake new economic modelling or surveys. \r\n\r\n Note: This document is hosted on the Department of Environment website.

    "description": "This dataset presents the statistics of hospitalisations with a principal diagnosis associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) excluding principal diagnosis of dialysis distributed by sex and age for the years between 2012-2015. The data is and is aggregated to the 2011 Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU) Population Health Areas (PHA), based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe CKD datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the PHIDU - PHAs.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

    "description": "The Australian Urban Health Indicators (AusUrb-HI) project, a collaboration between NCRIS facilities, AURIN, PHRN, and researchers, aims to improve understanding of urban and regional health. This dataset, developed with Cancer Council Queensland and the Australian Cancer Atlas, provides spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes in Queensland, exploring associations between various determinants and cancer patterns. The dataset’s goal is to identify spatial variations in breast cancer outcomes within Queensland, and motivate further research into their drivers.\nThis dataset includes seven spatial indicators of breast cancer outcomes for Queensland women, modeled using Bayesian statistics, covering the period of 2000-2019. These indicators, presented as Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) with 95% credible intervals and posterior probability differences (ppd), are at the Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2). The dataset provides modelled statistical indicators and geographic data, covering breast cancer outcomes, spatial epidemiology, health disparities, and cancer surveillance at the SA2 level (2016 ASGS) in Queensland, Australia. The intended application is for identifying geographical disparities in breast cancer, informing public health planning, and enabling further research.\nThe methodology uses linked health datasets from the Queensland Cancer Register, BreastScreen Queensland, and the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patients Data Collection. Bayesian spatial models with Besag-Yorke-Mollié (BYM) priors were applied, using a Poisson distribution with the log of expected counts as an offset, and incorporating spatial terms for neighboring regions. Models were validated using trace plots, density plots, Moran’s I statistics, and Geweke statistics.\nThe data is structured as a table, with each row representing an SA2 region, and columns representing indicator values and associated metrics. The complete attribute dictionary for the dataset is shown below:\n\nsa2: Five digital sa2 code using 2016 ASGS\nsa2name: Name of each sa2 area\n\nurban: Categorical variable with three levels: 1. brisbane/gold coast; 2. Cairns; 3. Rest of Queensland, with the first two representing the urban areas in Queensland. Categorised based on sa3 name.\n\n\nsir_incidence: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in incidence of breast cancer. SIR is using the total Queensland cohort as the reference population.\n\nlow_cri_incidence: The lower bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_incidence.\nhigh_cri_incidence: The higher bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_incidence.\n\nppd_incidence: The posterior probability difference of sir_incidence outcome, with ppd&gt;0.6 showing a significant difference from the Queensland average.\n\n\nsir_localised: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in proportion of invasive breast cancers that were diagnosed when localised. SIR is using the total Queensland cohort as the reference population.\n\nlow_cri_localised: The lower bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_localised.\nhigh_cri_localised: The higher bound of the 95% credible interval for the sir_localised.\n\nppd_localised: The posterior probability difference of sir_localised outcome, with ppd&gt;0.6 showing a significant difference from the Queensland average.\n\n\nsir_survive5yrs: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) showing the variation in surviving at least five years among women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.

    "title": "Darling River Snail Indicative Distribution in NSW",
    "description": "The Darling River Snail (also known as ‘River Snail’) is a mediumsized (20-25 mm) freshwater snail that was once common and\nwidespread in the Darling River and its tributaries. However\npopulations declined rapidly over the last few decades, probably as a\nresult of weir building and other activities associated with river flow\nmanagement. They are now virtually extinct throughout their natural\nrange. In the last decade, living specimens have only been found\nfrom within irrigation pipelines in southern NSW. They are a critically\nendangered species – www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/threatenedspecies/threatened-species-list/critically/river-snail/river-snail\nThe methods used to create the predicted current distribution of the\nDarling River Snail are described fully in: NSW Department of\nPrimary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community Status 2015 – Final\nReport.\nAll available records of the species were collated and assessed for\naccuracy. For current distribution, only records after 1 January 1994\nwere used. Within the framework of the Australian Hydrological\nGeospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology network, the records were\nassociated with attributes from the National Environmental Stream\nAttributes Database and River Styles® geomorphology. The\nAustralian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric V2 surface hydrology\nnetwork (Geofabric) is a fully connected and directed stream network\nbased a 9 second DEM. It allocates a unique stream segment\nnumber to each river reach in Australia. The Environmental\nAttributes Database is a set of lookup tables supplying attributes describing the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the\nstream and catchment environment that was developed by the\nAustralian National University (ANU) in 2011 and updated in 2012.\nThe data is supplied as part of the supplementary Geofabric\nproducts which is associated with the 9 second DEM derived\nstreams and the National Catchment Boundaries based on 250k\nscale stream network. 30 Stream variables were assessed for the\nmodelling.\nRiver Styles® provides a high resolution categorical classification of\nriver character within a nested hierarchy of criteria based on valley\nsetting, channel planform, geomorphic units, and bed material. The\nNSW Office of Water compiled a spatial dataset of River Styles®\nclassifications for a large number of the waterways of NSW. From 65\nRiver Style® categories we generated two new fields representing\nPlanform (34 categories) and Substratum (8 categories) for each\nstream segment. River Style® planform and substratum categories\nwere then assigned to each Geofabric segment.\nMaxEnt 3.3.3 is a widely used species distribution modelling program\nthat utilises presence records to generate probabilities of occurrence\nbased on a suite of environmental variables quantified across the\narea of interest. It was used to model the current geographic\ndistribution of each listed threatened freshwater aquatic species or\npopulation. We utilised logistic output to plot the predicted\ndistribution of each species. This output equates to a probability that\nthe species will be observed in each river reach, given the\nenvironmental conditions that exist there relative to the\nenvironmental conditions where the species is known to occur. For\nthis mapping, above 33% probability was considered predicted\npresence. Only stream segments with a modelled average daily flow\nof more than five megalitres were selected for output. In addition,\npredicted separate populations were connected by manual\ninterpretation. The predicted values for each river reach were\nconverted from the Geofabric framework to the higher resolution\n2013 NSW Strahler Stream Order Hydroline.",

    "description": "Site NTB-13 is sampled monthly by the Nyrstar Hobart as part of the  Derwent Ambient Water Quality monitoring program.\nSince 2003, ambient water quality monitoring has been carried out on a monthly basis at up to 28 sites throughout the Derwent estuary by Norske Skog Boyer, Nyrstar Hobart and the State Government. Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "##Description\r\nWhile at sea, Commonwealth fishers must record all catch and effort in their AFMA daily fishing logbooks. This dataset shows the annual fishing effort by fishery and gear, that fishers have recorded in their logbooks for Commonwealth fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nThese data are sourced from AFMA daily fishing logbooks, which fishers complete while at sea. Location of effort within a fishery is not included.\r\nFishing effort is measured differently depending on the fishing method used. In this dataset we provide the most common measures that are used by scientists. \r\n\r\n##Appropriate use and limitations of the data\r\nThe effort data in logbooks are estimates only, which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Effort data are used in combination with catch data, spatial data, and other relevant information (such as independent surveys) to inform stock assessments.\r\nThese data may differ from other summations over the same time-period (such as stock assessment reports) due to differences in data handling procedures. For example, scientists may standardise effort for assessments to account for issues such as changes in gear efficiency, catchability of fish and skipper expertise. They may also filter out effort from their assessments because of data quality issues.\r\nCare should be taken when interpreting trends in this data because there are many factors that can affect effort each year. Catch quantities can be impacted by management measures such as closures of fishing areas or reducing boat numbers. Similarly, changes in market demand can change fishing decisions and affect effort. \r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe dataset provided by AFMA is comprised of raw (unprocessed) data as received from fishers, and may contain errors or be incomplete. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.\r\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in April and May 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS022009 Leg 1.\n\nDeparted: \tLautoka Fiji, April 22, 2009\nArrived:  \tNuku'Alofa, Tonga, May 18, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",
