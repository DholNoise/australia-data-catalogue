    "description": "The Kimberley 200m mooring (IMOS platform code KIM200) is part of the Kimberley array. It was initially deployed on the 02/02/2012 at (15.76 S, 122.86 E). The site depth is 200m. This mooring array was discontinued, and this mooring removed in August 2014.\n\nMooring Designs replicate where possible similar instrumentation to the Shelf ITF moorings. Observations of currents, temperature and salinity are collected throughout the array with the coastal mooring also observing optical water quality parameters of fluorescence and turbidity. \n\nThe Kimberley array, in combination with the Pilbara array and the ITF Array will help determine the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow on the currents along the Northwest shelf  and as well as processed driving cross shelf exchange. \n\nThe Kimberly line will help document the southward flowing seasonal Holloway shelf current (thought to be connected to the Indonesian Throughflow). The Kimberly coast is characterised by high freshwater inputs, leading to a cross shelf density gradient.  The cross shelf arrays will allow variability in the  gradient of density and the resultant gravitational currents to be determined.",

    "description": "Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) vegetation maps. THPSS is a Threatened Ecological Community (TEC).  Using a 25 m Digital Elevation Modal (DEM) coupled with orthorectified aerial photography, the THPSS of the Sydney Basin were mapped in ArcGIS. Only valley-bottom swamps were mapped. Hanging swamps or hillslope drapes were excluded. In ArcGIS, the physical attributes of the swamps were attributed and measured. This included swamp area, elevation above sea level, swamp slope, catchment area, swamp and catchment elongation ratio, swamp length and distance to coast.\nFurther information on the enforceable undertaking and the terms of the THPSS Research Program can be found at www.environment.gov.au/news/2011/10/21/centennial-coal-fund-145-million-research-program.

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R2.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January 23, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, January 30, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "    \n\nGross Benefit Salinity (gb97s = p97s a pfe97) ($/ha/yr) dataset is one of 11\nnational surfaces, represented by ~1km grids, relating to economic\nopportunities associated with soil condition. All dollar values are given in\n1996/97 Australian dollars. There are three sub-types of data in this dataset:\nrelative yields, gross benefits and impact costs. Each is described as\nfollows:1. Relative yield (RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture,\nrelative to its full potential expressed as a percentage. It is equal to\nactual yield divided by potential yield. The relative yield surfaces, measured\nas a ratio (0 to 1) and represented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000;\nry_salt2020: The relative yield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020*\nry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative yield from soil acidity and soil sodicity*\nry_min: The limiting factor relative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid,\nry_esp and ry_min.* lim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity\nand salinity 2. Gross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit\nat full equity attainable through agricultural production if the yield-\nlimiting factor of salinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost.\nAs such it can be considered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the\nsoil. The gross benefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a;\ngb97e; gb97s a for soil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined\nlimiting factor gross benefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in\nagricultural profit at full equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity\nand extent over the time period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is\ndetermined only through changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in\ndryland salinity. Impact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full\nequity due to worsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords:\nEconomics, Natural Resources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil\nTreatmentData is in albers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a04.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "Report produced in collaboration between Universities and Commonwealth and State Government agencies.  \r\n\r\n Overview  \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  provide national assessments of the status of key wild-capture fish stocks. The reports provide scientifically based stock status assessments for 68 key species (or species complexes), which cumulatively contribute over 90 percent of the value and 85 percent of the volume from Australian fisheries. \r\n• Stock status assessments in the 2014 reports are based on the abundance and level of harvest in 2013. In total, 238 stocks were assessed across the 68 key species; 129 stocks were classified as sustainable, these contribute around 87.5 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. There were 7 stocks classified as transitional-recovering, 19 as transitional-depleting, 11 as overfished and 4 as environmentally limited. There were 68 stocks where status was classified as undefined; these stocks contribute 6.4 per cent of the total catch of the 68 species. \r\n• The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  focus on the status of targeted fish stocks. The status classifications do not consider broader ecosystem impacts of fishing, such as bycatch or habitat impacts, or social and economic considerations. These elements may be included in future editions, or companion reports. \r\n• The reports rely on a consistent national reporting framework that was developed collaboratively by fisheries scientists from around Australia. The framework provides transparency and consistency in stock status reporting across jurisdictions. \r\n• The Status of key Australian fish stocks reports 2014  builds on the 2012 inaugural edition with 19 new species. Four of the new species are caught in Commonwealth fisheries. The additional species were nominated by the states and the Northern Territory as either iconic species that are likely to be seen in retail outlets or historically overfished species. \r\n• There were minor alterations to the national stock status classification framework and species chapters. The main update to the framework is the inclusion of the new environmentally limited stock category. The  Status of key Australian fish stocks reports  Advisory Group included this additional category to describe stocks depleted below the limit reference point by environmental factors rather than fishing. \r\n• Between 2012 and 2014 there have been a number of changes to stock structure and stock status for some species. In both cases the changes are based on the most recent and reliable information available. \r\n• The reports were developed collaboratively by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) and government fishery research agencies from all states, the Northern Territory and the CSIRO; more than 100 fisheries researchers were involved. \r\n",

    "description": "In early 2011 PRL provided Geoscience Australia with the Old Drill Hole Clearing dataset.\nThis dataset shows the location of old drill lines cleared through the rainforest on Christmas\nIsland. Drill lines were cleared to test the land for phosphate deposits and were cleared from\nthe 1950’s through to the 1970’s, before Phosphate Resources Limited (PRL) began mining\non the island.\nThe Old Drill Hole Clearing dataset has been developed from the Peg and Line grid.   PRL used Surpac to create a road outline 7 m wide (this is the\nestimate of two dozer D6 blades widths) along each of the previous drill lines. They were\nthen stitched together and made into a polygon.\nThere seems to be a good correlation between the extent of the drill lines and evidence of\nclearing from the 1987 orthophotography.\nThe accuracy of the Peg and Line used as a base when the shapefile was produced is of\nrelevance. The error in the data appears to be in the vicinity of 100 metres. As clearing\nboundaries and coast (though highly simplified) of the same map plot in far better position\n(after transformation) in relation to the orthophotographs and other GIS themes, the majority\nof inaccuracy in this theme is probably inherited from the original map (abbsite.dwg). That\nis, it appears that the clearings and coast of abbsite.dwg are reasonably accurate though very\nimprecise (intended to be viewed at much greater scale), while the line and peg grid appears\nless accurate. Thus the grid on the GIS is mainly illustrative at this time.\nThere are no attributes assigned to the data.\nDisclaimer",

    "description": "The Exploring for the Future (EFTF) program is an Australian government initiative aimed at stimulating investment in resource exploration and development. It operates multiple interconnected projects, such as the Australia’s Resources Framework (ARF), a continental-scale endeavor to enhance understanding of Australia's geology and resource potential. A module of ARF, the Geochemistry for Basin Prospectivity (G4BP), studies Australian basins with prospective base metal mineral systems. \n\n\n\nThe current report focuses on the Neoproterozoic segment of the Stuart Shelf region in South Australia, a part of the Adelaide Rift Complex. This research is conducted collaboratively with the Geological Survey of South Australia, examining sediment-hosted copper potential in the rift complex.\n\n\n\nThe Adelaide Rift Complex is a geological formation that underwent extensive sedimentation from the Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian, particularly within the rift zone. Stuart Shelf sediments overlay Mesoproterozoic magmatic and Paleoproterozoic metasediment layers. The complex hosts multiple copper deposits, which are usually associated with movement of basinal brines that leach metals from lower basinal layers or rift-related volcanic rocks.\n\n\n\nTo improve understanding of the geology of the Stuart Shelf and related copper mineralisation, two primary objectives were set: \n\n\n\n1. Geochemical fingerprinting and baseline data collection: This involves compilation and reanalysis of existing data, along with new data collection aimed at providing comprehensive geochemical data for stratigraphic units within the Stuart Shelf.\n\n\n\n2. Identification of mineral system components: Utilising data from the first objective, this phase aims to identify potential metal and fluid sources and potential sites of metal deposition. \n\nIn conjunction with these efforts, a GA-GSSA geochemical sampling project is underway, tying geochemistry to lithostratigraphic units and facies. The newly acquired geochemical data will be integrated into the overall GSSA-CSIRO project to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the sediment-hosted stratabound mineral system.\n\n",

Each master report covers one Local Government Area and is entitled ‘Housing Affordability – Demand and Supply by Local Government Area’. \nThe Demand for Supply for LGA reports are available online at: https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/housing-affordability-demand-and-supply-by-local-government-area\nExplanatory Notes:\nData sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Census for Population and Housing and it is updated every 5 years in line with the ABS Census. \nThe nature of the income imputation means that the reported proportion may significantly overstate the true proportion. Census housing stress data is best used in comparing results over Censuses (ie did it increase or decrease in an area) rather than using it to ascertain what proportion of households were in rental stress.\nIncome bands are based on household income.\nHigh income households can also experience rental stress. These households are included in the total but not identified separately. Data is representative of households in very low, low and moderate income brackets.\nPlease note that there are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.",

    "description": "The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation produces floodplain mapping of rivers and major watercourses and provides floodplain development advice to ensure that proposed floodplain development has adequate flood protection and does not impact on the existing flood regime of the area.\n\nThis advice is related to major river flooding only. Other issues, such as stormwater drainage and environmental and ecological considerations are not addressed. \n\nBoth the floodway and flood fringe make up the 1 in 100 (1%) annual exceedance probability (AEP) floodplain, however there are areas where the floodplain exists, but the floodway and flood fringe does not. In such situations, a different floodplain management strategy applies (for example, the Swan River between the Narrows and Canning Bridges).\n\nThis dataset comprises two polygons - Flood fringe, and Floodway. The flood fringe is that part of the floodplain where development may be considered acceptable subject to certain building conditions that will provide adequate flood protection. The floodway is that part of the 1 in 100 (1%) AEP floodplain where development that is considered obstructive to major flows is not acceptable as it would increase flood levels upstream. No new buildings are acceptable in the floodway.\n\nNote: To see the full scope of the floodplain mapping, 12 dataset layers are required to be loaded in the following order:\n\nFLOODPLAIN DATASET LAYERS:    \nFPM Flood Level Points (m AHD)\nFPM Flood Level Contours (m AHD)\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Line\nFPM Extent of Flooding\nFPM Levee Banks\nFPM Location of Cross Sections\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodplain Development Control Area\nFPM Map Index\nFPM Bridges\nFPM Special Development Condition Area\nFPM 1 in 100 (1%) AEP Floodway and Flood Fringe Area\nFPM Floodplain Area\n\nThe dataset covers the following areas:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAvon River – Toodyay, Northam, York and Beverley Townsites. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nBlackwood River – Augusta, Bridgetown, Nannup and Boyup Brook Townsites.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nBrunswick River - Greater Bunbury \n</li>\n<li>\n\nCoblinine River &amp; Dorderyemunning Creek - Wagin Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nCollie River - Collie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nChapman River – Geraldton Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDenmark River – Denmark Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGascoyne River - Carnarvon Townsite and the Lower Gascoyne.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nGribble Creek - Kalgoorlie Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nHarding River - Roebourne Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nIrwin River - Dongara Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nLower Collie River - Greater Bunbury.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPreston River - Donnybrook Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSerpentine River, Peel, Birrega &amp; Oaklands Drains, Murray River and the Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary - Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Pinjarra and south to the Darling Scarp (Murray River) and Peel Inlet / Harvey Estuary to Wellard (Peel Main Drain), east to South Western Highway (Serpentine River) and north to Wungong Brook (Birrega Drain).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nSwan River, Canning River and Tributaries: Perth - Fremantle to Walyunga National Park (Swan River) and Canning Bridge to Brookton Highway (Canning River). Tributaries include Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Ellen Brook, Helena River, Henley Brook, Jane Brook, St Leonards Creek, Susannah Brook (Swan River) and Southern River/ Wungong Brook (Canning River).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nToby Inlet – Quindalup Townsite.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nVasse-Wonnerup Estuaries, Broadwater and New River - Busselton Townsite.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor further information on flooding and floodplain management in Western Australia please refer to our Water Facts publications: Flooding in Western Australia (Water facts 13) and Floodplain Management (Water facts 14).\n\nThis information is available at the following addresses:\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-13-Flooding-in-Western-Australia.pdf\nhttps://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2022-11/Water-facts-14-Floodplain-management.pdf\n\nGlossary:\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nAnnual exceedance probability (AEP) - the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage.\n</li>\n<li>\n\n1 in 100 AEP flood - this means that there is a 1 in 100 (or 1%) chance of a flow of this size or larger occurring in any one year. This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFlood fringe - the area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway where development could be permitted provided it is compatible with flood hazard and building conditions provide an adequate level of flood protection. These areas are generally covered by still or very slowly moving waters during a 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodway - the river channel and a portion of the floodplain where a significant flow or storage of water occurs during floods. If the floodway is even partially blocked, then the natural flooding regime of the area may be detrimentally impacted with flood levels being raised and affecting areas which may not have been previously affected. Development in floodways is to be avoided wherever possible.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for December 1988. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

Dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity samples were also collected at selected stations to continue the time series established during previous voyages, with these samples to be analysed on shore by the CSIRO carbon team. Additionally, Thermosalinograph (TSG) samples were continuously collected throughout the voyage, with on-board measurements of their salinity used to calibrate the ship's underway system.\nPlease cite the following manuscript when reporting or publishing data for silicate, phosphate, nitrate+nitrite (NOx) and nitrite:\nRees, C., L.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2018.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women who gave birth and reported smoking tobacco in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females who gave birth and reported smoking in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, divided by the total number of females who gave birth, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nSmoking refers to the use of cigarettes or inhaled tobacco.\n\n\nData excludes mothers whose smoking status was not stated.\n\n\nSmoking during pregnancy is self-reported smoking of tobacco.\n\n\nBecause of differences in definitions and methods used for data collection, care must be taken when comparing across jursidictions.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3 year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The 'Significance' of the mapped polygons reflects the 'Significance' of the species with the highest threat status for which the polygon represents potential habitat.  Only vegetation community polygons that represent threatened fauna habitat are included therefore the layer is not continuous.  \nThis dataset is part of the NRM Coastal Values Project.  The Project maps vegetation, fauna habitat and geomorphology from High Water mark to 100 metres inland for part of the coastline of the Southern and Northern NRM Regions of Tasmania.  The purpose of the coastal values mapping is to provide an easily accessible database on vegetation and geomorphology to support better strategic planning, land use planning and management on the coast.\n",

This dataset can be joined to the <a href=\"https://melbournetestbed.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/soil-sensor-locations/information/\">soil sensor locations</a> dataset using the site id column. This dataset contains a large number of records, to download only a particular sensor's readings see our attached <a href=\"https://help.opendatasoft.com/platform/en/exploring_catalog_and_datasets/02_looking_up_a_dataset/filtering_dataset.html\">guide on how to filter data</a>.\n\n📎 <strong>Note:</strong> An <strong>attachment ZIP file</strong> is available for download that contains the complete historical data for 2022.\n\nDifferent readings taken (based on unit column):- %VWC: Volumetric water content is a numerical measure of soil moisture. It is simply the ratio of water volume to soil volume.- ºC: Temperature in degrees celsius.- µS/cm: Salinity is the measure of the concentration of dissolved (soluble) salts in water from all sources. (microseimens per centimetre)Note this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every hour as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site.",

Applied, Approved and Under\nConstruction, and Complete.\n\nSite content is derived from a range of sources\nat various times and as such the content may not be free from errors, omissions\nor defects. Inconsistencies may occur in some data sets. The City of Melbourne\nuses its best endeavours to ensure that the information is reliable.\n\nThe massings in the Sketchup model are\nrepresentational only, sit on a two dimensional planar surface and are not\nintended for analytical or comparative purposes. The massings are derived by\nextruding simplified polygons of an indicative floor plate for the podium (if\nrelevant) and tower.

It measures and forecasts the statewide status and trends in population persistence and habitat carrying capacity, considering future climate change based on NARCliM1.0 climate models. The risk of future clearing of koala habitat is not part of the model. The model projects how the current pattern of native vegetation is able to support koalas into future climate.\nSpatial data identifies candidate areas for the establishment and enhancement of habitats that are capable of supporting koalas into the future. The project also identifies where translocating koalas into currently unoccupied regions has a higher likelihood of success.\nFor further detail refer to the KITL1.0 project technical report.\nKITL2.0 is currently under development. It also uses NARCliM1.0 climate models. Future versions of KITL will make use of updated climate and other input data, as it becomes available.",

Previously, students in support classes in mainstream schools were not included.\n\n\nStudents in schools for specific purposes (SSPs) are not included.\n\n\nStudents in distance education and Intensive English Centres are included with their appropriate grade levels.\n\n\nOC classes are not included in secondary students. IEC students are included.\n\n\nIn most scholastic years there are a small number of students in atypical age groups. For students under 18 years, these have been included in the nearest band. This is indicated with an asterisk. As a result, the sum of each row may not equal the totals reported.

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the _Public Sector Management Act 1994_, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the sectors reports is the public sector entity survey (PSES).\r\n\r\nThe 2016 PSES collected information across topics such as the application of _Commissioner’s Instruction No. 7 – Code of Ethics_, codes of conduct and general principles of human resource management, public interest disclosure, equal employment opportunity strategies and agency management at June 2016 or for the 2015/16 financial year. The survey was sent to chief executive officers and chief employees of public sector entities with over 20 full-time equivalents as at December 2015, including Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state. In 2016, 78 public sector entities completed the survey.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2016.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant entities to access online.\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2016 data.xls – individual agency responses to the PSES with a question key and response key. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset.\r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2016 data.sav – individual agency responses to the PSES, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset.\r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of PSES data is available in the State of the sectors statistical bulletin 2016.\r\n",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2013 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents projected implied dwelling requirements for 5-year periods between the years of 2011 and 2036 for the state of New South Wales (NSW). The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nHousehold projections show the number of households that would form if demographic trends continue and if assumptions about living arrangements are realised over the projection period. A household is two or more people who share a dwelling (house, apartment, townhouse, caravan, etc.) and share food and cooking facilities, and other essentials. Household projections show the future number and type of households living in private dwellings. Private dwellings are self-contained accommodation such as houses, apartments, mobile homes or other substantial structures. It does not include accommodation such as boarding houses, nursing homes or prisons.\nThe household projections also include the implied dwelling demand for those households.  This is the likely number of private dwellings needed to accommodate future population-driven demand.\nFor more information please read the Household Projections User Guide.Please note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nHousehold and dwelling numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. They should not be taken to be accurate to that level of detail.\n\n",

Each decision has been stamped and signed by the Secretary to Cabinet. A statement of certification as a correct copy is also stamped.\nThe circulation records include the decision number, location and date of the meeting, subject, submission number (number or oral submission), number of copies made and circulation details (number, name of minister or department, date and time).\nCabinet submissions were intended to lead to cabinet decisions and come in four distinct forms: policy, authority to prepare a Bill, authority to introduce a Bill, and authority to forward significant subordinate legislation. Submissions include the submission number, copy number and the name of the person or department making the submission. Each submission is stamped with the date and time received. Supporting documentation for submissions are included, such as plans, reports and bills. \nCabinet Minutes are held at Queensland State Archives",

The scale is <em>n chains/mile to one inch</em> and the plans are based on the Bonne Modified Conical Projection.\n\nBefore 1903, Public Plans of most of the areas covered by this series were drawn on sheets of the C, G, M, N and K collection of plans (see Record Series No. 979).\n\nFrom 1903, sheets of the 300 Chain cadastral series were used as bases for the Public Plans.\n\nAlready in 1910, some of the Public Plans on 300 Chain sheets were cancelled to, and continued on sheets of the 80 Chain series. In the 1970's, the 300 Chain series began to be retired in favour of sheets constructed on the Universal Mercator projection, with sheet lines conforming to the Australian Map Grid.\n\nThe sheets are hand coloured and annotated on lithographic bases (app. 68cm x 101cm), linen backed. Later plans are drawn on acetate sheets.\n\nThe plans in this series are held at the State Records Office at consignment 4567.",

    "title": "The collection of aerial photographs held by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre",
    "description": "Aerial photography has been an important means of acquiring spatial data in Antarctica and the subantarctic islands, though satellite imagery is playing an increasingly important role.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Data Centre's collection of aerial photographs includes (but is not limited to) the following.\n\n1 Vertical and oblique aerial photography of the Australian Antarctic Territory coastline and some inland areas, acquired by the US Navy during Operation Highjump in 1946/47.\n\n2 Vertical and oblique aerial photography flown by National Mapping (now part of Geoscience Australia) during 1954 - 1965 from fixed wing aircraft, mainly using a K17 trimetrigon camera. From 1960 the vertical camera in the system was replaced with a Wild RC9.  An Eagle V camera was also used in 1963. The photography was acquired along the Australian Antarctic Territory coastline  and over the Prince Charles Mountains.\n\n3 Comprehensive and systematic coverages of the Prince Charles Mountains and Enderby Land flown by National Mapping from a fixed wing aircraft in the 1970s using a Wild RC 9 camera.\n\n4 Photography acquired since 1977 from helicopters using non-metric Hasselblad and Linhof cameras. This photography was acquired principally for life science research and was not intended to be used for mapping. The photography was acquired over Heard Island, Macquarie Island, the Larsemann Hills, the Windmill Islands, the Vestfold Hills and Mawson Coast.\n\n5 Photography acquired since 1992/93 by the Australian Antarctic Division and AUSLIG (now part of Geoscience Australia) from helicopters using a Zeiss UMK camera. It has been used to acquire photography for large scale mapping of the Australian Antarctic Territory, Heard Island and Macquarie Island.\n\n6 Photography acquired since 2000 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a Wild RC8 camera. A revision of the guidelines for overflight heights over animal colonies required that animal census photography be done with a camera with a longer focal length than the Linhof camera previously used for this type of work.  This was in order to maintain the same scale at a greater height. The Wild RC8 camera has also been used for photography for mapping at the Windmill Islands.\n\n7 Photography of sea ice acquired since 2003 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a digital Nikon D1X digital camera.\n\n8 Photography of Adelie penguin colonies and other features acquired since 2009/10 by the Australian Antarctic Division from helicopters using a digital Hasselblad H3D-II 50 digital camera.\n\nDigital flight lines and photo centres have been generated to represent the runs along which the photographs were taken and the centres of the photographs.  \n\n \n\nThe photos are scanned on a needs basis. Most of the Operation Highjump photos have been scanned but overall a minority of the photos have been scanned.  Preview images have been created of the scanned photos. The scanning of the Operation Highjump photos is described by a separate metadata record: 'Digital images of Operation Highjump aerial photography'.\n\nThe collection can be searched in two ways.\n\n1 A web search - see Aerial Photograph Catalogue link below.  Preview images of the scanned photos may be viewed using this search. In addition to the search, the Catalogue has tabs with information about viewing or obtaining photographs, the cameras used and further historical information.\n\n2  The flight line and photo centre data can be downloaded as shapefiles (refer to url below) and overlaid on topographic data in GIS software such as ArcGIS.  The Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) has mainly large to medium scale data topographic data available for download - refer to url below.\n\nThere are some flight lines for which photo centres have not yet been generated and some photo centres for which flight lines have not yet been generated.  This is being done gradually over time.  The flight line and photo centre shapefiles available for download will be updated about every six months.\n\nAlso available for download is a document with information about the cameras and a timeline for the photography - refer to url below.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2003 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "A CYG area is an area or precinct where EPA knows groundwater has been contaminated by:\n    • an activity\n    • waste\n    • pollution\n    • contaminated land.\nCYG areas are where contaminant levels threaten one or more environmental values.\nThe groundwater in a CYG area may not be suitable for some uses. It may be harmful to human health and the environment.\nIt's important for anyone who wants to use groundwater in CYG areas to test it to make sure it's safe to use.\nEach CYG area has a status to help you understand how much groundwater investigation and clean-up has been done.\nEPA assigns a CYG area one of 3 statuses:\n    1. Post remediation – clean-up of groundwater has been done, but some groundwater contamination remains. All former groundwater quality restricted use zones (GQRUZs) have this status.\n    2. Under assessment – further monitoring, evaluation and/or remediation of the groundwater is expected.\n    3. Precinct – the source of groundwater contamination is not clear. There's evidence it comes from multiple sites. Clean-up of the groundwater cannot be effectively completed.\nWhen a particular area is not captured by a CYG area, it does not mean that the groundwater there is suitable for use. The groundwater may not have been tested. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the CYG area data published. EPA will not be held liable or responsible for any errors, or for any loss incurred from reliance on this data. For further information about a particular CYG area, refer to the accompanying assessment report (where available) or contact EPA.",

    "description": "This data was collected in September/October 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_V05.\n\nDeparted: \tGeraldton, WA, Sept 21, 2011\nArrived:   \tFremantle, WA, Oct 17, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). 13-C values were recorded for 5 foraminiferal species through the core, with results varying considerably throughout the last 30kyr. The 13-C values of the benthic Cibicidoides spp. are the lowest, whilst those for the planktonic species are comparable, once correlated for their vital effects (except Globorotalia truncatulinoides because no correction for vital effects is available). It is apparent from the 13-C values that there are 3 main 13-C phases during the glacial/interglacial transition: Glacial, Deglaciation and Holocene phases.",

    "description": "\nThis map contains district-based ACT canopy cover polygons at 1m resolution (vegetation cover above 3m) as at April/May 2020, detected with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The full ACT vector dataset has been split into districts and 1km tiles to allow for easier viewing.\n<strong>WARNING: Due to</strong><strong> complexity and high resolution this dataset </strong><strong>may draw slowly or appear to miss some trees. For best results, zoom in, view single districts separately, or download a local copy.</strong>\nLIDAR data was acquired in April/May 2020 for the ACT under contract by Aerometrex, at an average resolution of 12ppm. LiDAR is classified to Level 3 (for ground) and delivered as LAS v1.4 in in GDA2020 MGA zone 55. Visit <a href=\"https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data\">https://www.planning.act.gov.au/professionals/survey-spatial/spatial-information/lidar-data</a> for more info. Processing was completed on the LAS GDA2020 MGA Zone 55 LAS tile set using AHD vertical datum at 1m resolution. Dataset represents high vegetation above 3m (tree canopy or tree-approximate objects - see caveats).\nMethodology:<ul><li>High noise errors were reclassified.</li><li>Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surfaces were created using ArcPro 2.8 LAS Dataset Geoprocessing Tools at 1 m resolution.</li><li>Canopy Height Model CHM was determined = Digital Surface Model (DSM) - Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li><li>Pits (empty cells inside tree canopies) of 2 pixel (2x1m) were removed using Nibble.</li><li>An ACT Urban building footprint layer generated from the 2020 LIDAR dataset by Aerometrex was used to remove spurious canopy portions from building roof areas in the urban area.</li><li>An NDVI layer from pan-sharpened Pleiades multispectral satellite imagery, acquired in April 2019 (the Uriarra area) and November 2019 (rest of Urban Area) was used to delete erroneous non-vegetative surfaces in urban areas.</li><li>Canopy holes &lt;=1m2 were filled by Eliminate tool.</li><li>GDA2020 MGA Zone 55.</li><li>Tree canopy lower than 3m were removed. Converted to a binary raster, then converted to vector.</li></ul>\n\nOther available datasets: ACT 2020 Canopy Height Model (raster), ACT Trees (Individual Delineated Trees with Height) (vector), DEM, DSM, Contours, Building Footprints (© Australian Capital Territory &amp; Aerometrex Limited), ACT Permeability, shrub cover - contact spatialdata@act.gov.au. Full LAS Tile sets can also be obtained in the following vertical datums: GDA2020 ellipsoidal, AHD, AVWS - see <a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/</a>. Other derivative products (including other canopy products) are available on request or through the ACT <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com\">Geospatial Data Catalogue</a>.\nRoad, Block and Division Canopy 2020 Statistics also available here: <a href=\"https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about\">https://actmapi-actgov.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/act-canopy-cover-2020-statistics/about</a>\nCaveats:1. Please note that most (if not all) CHM-based tree delineation results should be thought of as &quot;tree-approximate objects&quot;, and not actual trees. 2.

This has been calculated with the number of people who did not claim a GP attendance, divided by the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as at 30 June 2016, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the financial year of 2016-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims data, which are administered by the Australian Government Department of Health. These claims data are derived from administrative information on services that qualify for a Medicare benefit under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and for which a claim is processed by the Department of Human Services.\nFor further information about this dataset visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Medicare Benefits Schedule GP and Specialist Attendances and Expenditure in 2016-17 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nMBS claims data do not include services that were provided free of charge to public patients in hospitals or were subsidised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, compensation arrangements or through other publicly funded programs including jurisdictional salaried GP services provided in remote outreach clinics.\n\n\nGP attendances are Medicare benefit-funded patient/doctor encounters, such as visits and consultations, for which the patient has not been referred by another doctor. GP attendances do not include services provided by practice nurses and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners on a GP's behalf.\n\n\nUnique GP patients were identified through the Patient Identification Numbers (PINs) in the Medicare claim records.\n\n",

    "description": "Flow cytometry data was collected in October 2008, in waters off South Australia. \n\nThe general purpose of the study is to be able to establish background knowledge on the ecosystem on the continental shelf of South Australia and the impact of upwelling/saline outflow events on microbial communities to ultimately develop a biogeochemical model of the region. Sampling was carried out during cruises conducted on board the RV Ngerin as part of the Southern Australian Integrated Marine System (SAIMOS). During each cruise, the physical, chemical and biological properties of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (FM) layer were investigated. Flow cytometry data has been collected for picophytoplankton, bacteria and viruses.\n\nSix main stations have been sampled over the course of the study, five are located on the 100 m isobath, i.e. RS (35.508S, 136.278E), B2 (35.418S, 136.148E), B3 (35.258S, 136.048E), B4 (35.168S, 135.418E) and B5 (35.008S, 135.198E), and one from an offshore station (B1; 36.188S, 136.178E) located southwest of Kangaroo Island. Note that combining the distances between stations (14–25 nautical miles), the average component of the current velocity at middepth along the shelf (0.01 m s21) and the average speed of the vessel (i.e. 9 knots) indicate that different water masses were sampled at each station. Additional samples have on occasion been collected from the National Reference Station (NRS) at Kangaroo Island (35.832S, 136.447E) and the SA Spencer Gulf Mouth Mooring (SAM8SG, 35.25S, 136.690E), where the saline outflow occurs.",

    "description": "Snow data is sourced from each of the resorts, using data collected each morning by on-mountain staff. The measuring of natural snow depths is done at up to four gauge locations (snow plots) at the resorts. From these locations an average overall depth is ascertained, as well as an average 24hr snowfall. The average depth in snow-making areas is calculated from depths taken from probing the areas where snow-making occurs.\nNotwithstanding that all Victorian alpine resorts (other than Mount Stirling) routinely make snow during the season when the conditions are suitable, snow depth in snow-making areas may not be reported in cases where only limited ski lift accessible terrain is open, particularly early or late in the season.\nIn addition, during the season, when there is an abundance of natural snow, accurate snow depth measurements in snow-making areas may not have been recorded. Rather, snow depth in snow-making areas may have been assumed to be equal to natural snow depth or may have been recorded as exceeding the reported snow depth (e.g. 146cm+). This means that recorded snow depths in snow-making areas, may be less than the actual snow depths in snow-making areas.\nIn addition the snow reporting service ceases when resort operations cease, be that before or at the official end of the snow season. As a consequence, no snow depths are reported subsequently, notwithstanding that significant snow depth may remain.",

    "title": "SGSEP - Rental Affordability Index - All dwellings for Australia (Polygon) Q1 2011-Q2 2021",
    "description": "This dataset presents the Rental Affordability Index (RAI) for all dwellings. The data uses a single median income value for all of Australia (enabling comparisons across regions), and spans the quarters Q1 2011 to Q2 2021. The RAI covers all states with available data, the Northern Territory does not form part of this dataset.\nNational Shelter, Bendigo Bank, The Brotherhood of St Laurence, and SGS Economics and Planning have released the RentalAffordability Index (RAI) on a biannual basis since 2015. Since 2019, the RAI has been released annually.\nIt is generally accepted that if housing costs exceed 30% of a low-income household's gross income, the household is experiencing housing stress (30/40 rule). That is, housing is unaffordable and housing costs consume a disproportionately high amount of household income. The RAI uses the 30 per cent of income rule. Rental affordability is calculated using the following equation, where 'qualifying income' refers to the household income required to pay rent where rent is equal to 30% of income: \nRAI = (Median income ∕ Qualifying Income) x 100\nIn the RAI, households who are paying 30% of income on rent have a score of 100, indicating that these households are at the critical threshold for housing stress. A score of 100 or less indicates that households would pay more than 30% of income to access a rental dwelling, meaning they are at risk of experiencing housing stress.\nFor more information on the Rental Affordability Index please refer to SGS Economics and Planning.\nThe RAI is a price index for housing rental markets. It is a clear and concise indicator of rental affordability relative to household incomes, applied to geographic areas across Australia. \nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using geometries provided by SGS Economics and Planning. Values of 'NA' in the original data have been set to NULL.",

    "description": "This data set is a summary of seismic survey transects from 1961 to 2015. The data was summarised to 0.1 deg grids and the number of km of the grid surveyed over a 5 year period was calculated. \n\nGeoscience Australia is releasing its 2014 version of the Marine Seismic Surveys Shape and Kml files. These files have been updated to include recent openfile surveys. The spatial files have been created from a cleansed, updated collection of p190 navigation files. This navigation collection has grown from the checking of navigation submitted to the GA Repository under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulations\n\nhttp://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_f5f24293-c9c1-6ed9-e044-00144fdd4fa6/Marine+Seismic+Survey+Shape+and+Kml+Files+-+2014+Version\n\nThis data contains geographical information in shapefiles that represent 2D and 3D seismic surveys from 1961 to 2013.They represent most of the seismic surveys shot around Australia. \nAccording to Mike Sexton (pers. comm., 2013; GA) 3D surveys are modern surveys that shoot with multiple cables, acquiring many times more data than a 2D survey. The cables have no impact on the environment.\n\n Over time, seismic surveys have used a variety of sources commencing with dynamite in the 1960s (usually 50 lbs, but sometimes 200 lbs). The shot spacing was usually of the order of 200 m. Since then, electrical discharges (sparkers), gas-exploders, vibratory sources and air guns have been used. The shot interval has been reduced to about 20 m.",

    "description": "This record describes the CTD data collected on Investigator voyage IN2024_V05, titled: \"Multi-year: Untangling the causes of change over 25 years in the southeast marine ecosystem (SEA-MES Voyage 3).\" The voyage took place between November 13, 2024 and December 12, 2024 (AEST), departing from Hobart and returning to Hobart.\nData for 94 CTD deployments were acquired using the Sea-Bird SBE911 CTD unit #24 (Serial Number 1332), fitted with 36 twelve-litre bottles on the rosette sampler. Sea-Bird-supplied calibration factors were used to compute the pressures and preliminary conductivity values. CSIRO-supplied calibrations were applied to the temperature data. The data were subjected to automated QC to remove spikes and out-of-range values.\nCalibration for Active Heave Compensation (AHC) appears to have changed post dry dock, resulting in loops on SeaSave plots after AHC is turned on. This also caused the CTD wire to become slack due to the compensation sending out too much wire. Rapp McGregor assisted the Chief Engineer to dial down the maximum winch speed to prevent wire slack from occurring on up heave, in the event the winch compensation was in phase with the actual heave. The issue was observed to cause an additive effect instead of the intended effect of keeping the CTD steady. The issue was further investigated and resolved following the voyage.\nThe final conductivity calibration was based on a single deployment grouping. The final calibration from the primary sensor had a standard deviation (SD) of 0.0015089 PSU, well within our target of ‘better than 0.002 PSU’. The standard product of 1-decibar binned averages were produced using data from the primary sensors.\nThe dissolved oxygen data calibration fit had a SD of 0.83742 μM. The agreement between the CTD and bottle data was good.\nFluorometer, transmissometer, PAR, CDOM and turbidity sensors were also installed on the auxiliary A/D channels of the CTD.\nThe collected data were processed (quality-controlled), and subsequently archived by the CSIRO National Collections and Marine Infrastructure (NCMI) Information and Data Centre (IDC).\nAdditional information regarding this dataset may be contained in the Voyage Summary and the Data Processing Report.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, divided by the number of females having their second birth whose first birth was by caesarean section and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who are having a singleton for their second birth and whose first birth was by caesarean section.\n\n\nExcluded are those females whose second birth is a multiple birth, those who are not having their second birth, and those who are having their second birth and whose first birth was a vaginal birth.\n\n\nData for Victoria in 2007 to 2009 were not available.\n\n\nData for WA in 2013 is not published as complete data due to only half a year being reported.\n\n\nFrom 2014, Caesarean section at most recent previous birth indicator data item was introduced into the Perinatal NMDS. Although not an NMDS/DSS item prior to 2014, data items appear to match the data element developed by NPDDC, Caesarean section indicator (last previous birth).\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "The River Tamar marine habitat project 1:25,000 depicts marine habitats from West Head [146d 43m, -41d 4m] to Launceston [147d 8m, -41d 27m]. The habitat types depicted in the dataset include Cobble, Reef, Sand, Silt, Seagrass, and Vegetated. The data was collected through intensive field sampling from September 2007 to March 2008 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The use of underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data and a Differential GPS unit allowed for the extensive area to be surveyed. The dataset is intended to be used to fulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995.",

    "description": "This record is an overview entry for biological data collected on Soela cruise SO 5/88. This cruise took place in the North West Shelf during 16 September - 14 October 1988, under the leadership of Keith Sainsbury. Biological data collected on this cruise include demersal fish and invertebrate samples from 105 stations, with up to 100 species being caught per 30 min trawl with the greatest diversity occurring at the shallower stations. 35 mm camera photography of 85 trawls including some video photography camera trials. Length frequency data for 14 species of fish (see taxonomy keywords). Otoliths and stomach contents for 4 of the main species (L. choerorynchus, S. undosquamis, N. furcosus and L. sebae) for ageing and dietary studies. Data from various fish traps and bait type trials. 3 hydrographic transects were completed with the submersible data logger (SDL) and sediment grab samples for organic nutrient content analysis. Over 300 taxa of fish, mollusc and crustacea specimens including photographs for the I. S. R. Munro fish collection in Hobart. Acoustic data from the region. Please note: This metadata record is a preliminary entry derived from information in the cruise plan and/or cruise report. Individual data types - which may span several cruises - will be indexed separately within this metadata system in due course. - Biological Field Data Sheets recorded during this voyage have been scanned to PDF, and are available (to CSIRO Staff) on-line. See the details link under \"Stored Media List\" (below).",

    "description": "The depiction of zones as defined under the PWS Management Zoning Policy for reserves where PWS is the managing authority and a statutory management plan is not in place.\n\nPWS manages over 800 reserves reserved under the Nature Conservation Act 2002 and managed under the National Parks and Reserves Management Act 2002.\n\nWhile statutory management plans have been prepared for most of the national parks and higher use reserves, many reserves do not have a plan to guide their management. The General Plan for reserves and associated zoning seeks to provide that guidance and direction.\n\nA core function of management plans is to establish zoning, in order to guide use and development. The zones in this dataset comply with the requirements of the PWS General Plan for Reserves, as well as the PWS Zoning Policy.\n\nAs per the PWS Zoning Policy, the zone categories include; Visitor Services, Utilities, Recreation, Protection and Natural.\n\nThe creation of interim zones was a computer generated process underpinned by the input and analysis of spatial data and then interpretation and refinement of the zone boundaries by professional staff to produce the final zones in the GIS.\n\nInput spatial data was sourced from the PWS GIS and Asset Management Systems, DPIPWE Natural and Cultural Heritage Divisions, Natural Values Atlas, Mineral Resources Tasmania and Land Tasmania's The LIST.\n\nBusiness rules were documented to guide PWS staff on which spatial datasets are sourced and how they are utilized in the zoning process to create each of the zone boundaries. This process has been encapsulated into a series of ArcGIS models that are executed on a desktop GIS. The models have been documented into technical business rules to guide GIS staff to rerun the model if required, eg. when source data substantially changes.\n\nLinks to the business rules and policy documents can be found below. This also includes descriptions and intent of the zone categories.\n\nReserve Management Zoning Policy - http://workspace-dpipwe.icognition.com.au/?urilist=1r608816\n\nGeneral Plan for Reserves Policy - http://workspace-dpipwe.icognition.com.au/?urilist=1r6705232\n\nGeneral Plan Business Rules for Zoning PWS Reserves - http://workspace-dpipwe.icognition.com.au/?urilist=1r6704439",

The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "title": "Torres Strait Geology - Age and Lithological Description - 1970 (Willmott WF, NRME)",
    "description": "This dataset shows the geology of the Torres Strait region. The polygons in this dataset are a digital representation of the distribution or extent of geological units within the area. Polygons have a range of attributes including unit name, age, lithological description and an abbreviated symbol for use in labelling the polygons. These have been extracted from the Rock Units Table held in the Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy Merlin Database.\n\nThe dataset was compiled in 1970 by WF Willmott (BMR), simplified from mapping in 1968 by DS Trail, WF Willmott, WD Palfreyman (B.M.R), WG Whitaker (G.S.Q.).\n\nThe islands were mapped using two dinghies operating from a 45-foot chartered launch. Air photography was available for the islands, except for Stephens, Darnley, and Murray Islands, the shapes of which are consequently uncertain. For the Torres Strait Sheet geology was plotted on photoscale maps (1:50,000) made by the Royal Australian Survey Corps, and later reduced to 1:250,000 scale. For the Daru-Maer Island Sheet the geology was plotted directly at 1:250,000 scale. \n\n\nData Format:\n\nShapefile with 297 polygon features and has a range of attributes including unit name, age, lithological description and an abbreviated symbol for use in labelling the polygons. \nDefinition source: The Rock Units Table held in the Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy Merlin Database. \n\n\nROCK_U_NAM: The Map Unit Name of the polygon. In the case of named units it comprises of the standard binomial name. Unnamed subdivisions of named units include the binomial name with a letter symbol as a suffix. Unnamed units are represented by a letter symbol, usually in combination with a map sheet number.\n\nAGE:Geological age of unit (Quarternary, Tertiary, Mesozoic, Late Carboniferous, Carboniferous) \n\nLITH_SUMMA: Provides a brief description of the map units as they have been described in the course of the project work, or as has appeared on relevant hard copy map legends. \n* Basalt lava and tuff\n* Coastal marine deposits: saltpans, mangrove swamps, lagoonal deposits; sand, mud\n* Clay, silt, sand, gravel; flood plain alluvium\n* Leucocratic and porphyritic biotite granite, hornblende-biotite adamellite, granodiorite\n* Rhyolitic welded tuff, rhyolite, agglomerate, volcanic breccia, andesite, siltstone, arenite\n* Porphyry\n* Residual and colluvial soil, sand, gravel, rubble, some semi-consolidated material\n* Lithics and crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite; volcanic rudite and breccia; rhyolite; andesite; some volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks\n* Lithics and crystal-rich dacitic to rhyodacitic ignimbrite; tuffaceous siltstone, sandstone\n* Crystal-rich rhyolitic ignimbrite; rhyolite; volcaniclastic rudite\n* Sandstone, conglomerate and shale\n* Younger dune sand and some minor older dune sand with dune ridges\n\nROCK_U_TYP: Provides a means of separating map units, eg for constructing a map reference. This item will contain one of the following: \n* STRAT- Stratigraphic unit, including sedimentary, volcanic and metamorphic rock units. \n* INTRU- Intrusive rock units;\n* COMPST- Compound unit where the polygon includes two or more rock units, either stratigraphic, intrusive or both; \n* COMPST- Compound unit, as above where the dominant or topmost unit is of the STRAT type; \n* COMPIN-  Compound unit, as above, where the dominant unit is of the INTRU type;  \n* WATER-  Water bodies- Large dams, lakes, waterholes. \n\nSEQUENCE_N: A numeric field to allow sorting of the rock units in approximate stratigraphic order as they would appear on a map legend.\n\nDOMINANT_R: A simplified lithological description to allow generation of thematic maps based on broad rock types.\n* BASALT\n* MISCELLANEOUS UNCONSOLIDATED SEDIMENTS\n* ALLUVIUM\n* GRANITOID\n* FELSITES (LAVAS, CLASTICS & HIGH-LEVEL INTRUSIVES)\n* COLLUVIUM\n* SEDIMENTARY ROCK\n* SAND\n\nMAP_SYMBOL: Provides an abbreviated label for polygons. Mostly based on the letter symbols as they appear on published maps or the original hard copy compilation sheets. These are not unique across the State, but should be unique within a single map tile, and usually adjacent tiles.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February and March 2009 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS012009.\n\nDeparted: \tWellington, New Zealand, February 03, 2009\nArrived:  \tNuku'Alofa, Tonga, February 25, 2009\nDeparted: \tNuku'Alofa, Tonga, February 26, 2009\nArrived:  \tLautoka, Fiji, March 23, 2009\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This data was collected in November - December 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Aurora Australis (IMOS platform code: VNAA) voyage AA1213V1.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, November 19, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart, Tasmania,  December 14, 2012\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser.  Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is at about 6 m depth. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the oceanographic lab next to the pCO2 system. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 70 seconds with warming usually less than 0.7ºC in cold waters near freezing. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system.",
