    "description": "This dataset shows the distribution of fresh and saline water 10 m below the water table in the Superficial aquifer, in the Esperance groundwater area. Salinity categories are not defined further than 6,000 mg/L which has been used to represent the saltwater interface. \n\nThis dataset is a derived location based on an assessment of data for the period November 2020 to November 2021. The 2016 Interpretation of TEMPEST Airbourne Electromagnetic Data from Esperance (Mira Geoscience) was also used in creating this dataset. This location can change pending known factors that impact the location of the seawater interface including the time of year, tidal movements, abstraction, recharge and throughflow.  \n\nThe full assessment of the SWI in this area is documented in report HR437 Esperance Seawater Interface Priority Area Assessment. \n\nThis dataset is sourced from the Statewide Seawater Interface Project, funded by the Government of Western Australia under the State Groundwater Investigation Program. \n\nIn the Esperance area, the project runs from April 2020 to March 2023 and the data are collected from: \n- Seawater interface monitoring (SWIM) bores installed or owned by the department\n- Downhole natural gamma and induction logging\n- Installation of data loggers and continuous static groundwater level (SWL) measurements from data loggers\n- Electrical conductivity (EC) depth profiling\n- Groundwater chemistry sampling.\n- Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey.\nThe above data that is owned by the department can be downloaded from the Water Information Reporting (WIR) Portal or by contacting the Department. AEM survey data can be downloaded via the interactive geological map tool GeoVIEW.WA from the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety. \nInformation on the SWI project can be found on the Western Australia State Government website (www.wa.gov.au).",

The data can be used for Ocean Colour sensor validation. Parameters measured are the concentration of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments and retrieved chlorophyll a estimate, the absorption coefficient for dissolved (aCDOM) particulate (a/p) and detrital or non-algal (a/d) components of the water column. 20 stations were sampled. The data was used primarily to validate ocean colour sensors MERIS, MODIS and SeaWIFs and the SST sensor AATSR. Samples were collected and analysed for  pigments, total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved and particulate absorption coefficients. CLW deployed instruments RAMSES, ac-9, Hydroscat and Hydrorad.",

    "description": "With population growth in the Adelaide city centre a priority for both the Government of South Australia and the City of Adelaide, a joint research study was commissioned by the two organisations into the market for Adelaide city living. \nThe work, undertaken by Hudson Howells in South Australia, identified key market segments for Adelaide, as well as providing insights into perceptions of Adelaide as a residential proposition, product preferences, competitor environment and relocation decision making.  \nThe research comprised four surveys and seven focus groups. Reports outlining the results of each study and the round of focus groups are available here as pdf files. Survey raw data is also provided here in excel and spss formats for use by the development community and others.\nIn particular providing the data in spss format allows for further statistical interrogation and additional insights into the Adelaide city living market.",

    "description": "Under the Urban Forest Strategy, there are ten Precinct Plans that provide detailed information about how planting will occur in local streets to meet the objectives of the strategy. A planting schedule for streets in each precinct has been developed in consultation with the community and is based on:\n\n-  Community priorities\n\n-  Location and density of vulnerable residents\n\n-  Opportunities for new planting\n\n-  Hot and very hot streets, as shown in thermal imaging \n\n-  Useful Life Expectancy of existing trees\n\n-  Existing canopy cover\n\n\nThis dataset shows the anticipated timeframe for tree planting in each street across the City of Melbourne. This timing is provisional and subject to change. The schedule for some streets may be moved forward or delayed by capital works, developments or renewal projects that impact on tree planting or survival. \n\n\nTo learn more about the Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans, visit http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sustainability/urbanforest/pages/urbanforest.aspx",

    "title": "Benthic cover and fish density on fringing reefs of inshore island groups of the GBR, 1999 ¿ 2014 (NERP 8.2, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset consists of site and zone means of the percent cover of major benthic categories and the density of fish functional groups on fringing coral reefs of the Keppel, Whitsunday and Palm Island groups, as a result of monitoring surveys carried out between 1999 and 2014. \r\n\r\nThis data extract summarises the results of a long-term monitoring project that assesses the effects of no-take marine reserve zoning in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \r\n\r\nSpatial zoning for multiple-use is the cornerstone of management for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Multiple-use zoning was first implemented widely in the GBRMP in the late 1980¿s and this original zoning plan was in place until 2004, when the marine park was completely rezoned under the Representative Areas Program (RAP). The overall proportion of the marine park area assigned into NTRs was increased from around 5% (~ 25% of the coral reefs) to 33.4%. The need to objectively assess the ecological consequences of zoning management has attracted an increasing amount of research effort in recent years.  Critical knowledge gaps still remain however, and research is required to determine how and to what extent NTR networks may help to protect biodiversity, sustain stocks of fished species and increase ecosystem resilience.  \r\n\r\nThis project was established in 1999 and expanded in 2004, with the primary objective of providing a robust assessment of the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on inshore coral reefs of the GBRMP. The project uses underwater visual census (UVC) to provide a spatially and temporally replicated assessment of fish and benthic communities and will include concurrent surveys of coral health within no-take (Green) and fished (Blue) zones on high-use inshore reefs. It is one of the few long-term monitoring projects specifically assessing the effects of zoning management within the GBRMP and the only one with a solid baseline data set that was established prior to the implementation of the 2004 zoning management plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nUnderwater visual census (UVC) was used to survey reef fish and benthic communities on fringing coral reefs of the Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday and Keppel Island groups. Within each island group, sites are evenly distributed between zones that have remained open to fishing (General Use and Conservation Park zones), NTRs that were closed to fishing in 1987, and NTRs that were established in 2004 (Marine National Park zones).\r\n\r\nWithin each site UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (50m x 6m, 300m2 survey area). Transects were deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 metres depth.  Using SCUBA, two observers recorded approximately 190 species of fish from 15 Families (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, Siganidae and Zanclidae). A third diver (observer 3) swam directly behind observers one and two, deploying the transect tapes.  This UVC technique reduces diver avoidance or attraction behaviour of the surveyed fish species.  To increase accuracy of the fish counts, the species list was divided between the two fish observers.  Observer one surveyed the fish families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Serranidae and the larger species of Labridae targeted by fishers. Observer two surveyed the families Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Siganidae, Zanclidae and small ¿non-targeted¿ species of Labridae. Pomacentrids and small labrids were recorded by observer two during return transect swims within a 2m band (1m either side of the tape, 100m2 survey area).  \r\n\r\nBroad-scale structural complexity of the reef habitat was estimated by observer one using a simple method that applied a rank (1-5) to both the angle of the reef slope and the rugosity for each ten-metre section of each transect. Observer three utilised a line intercept survey method to record a benthic point sample every metre along each transect tape (50 samples per transect).Benthos sampled in the benthic survey was live and dead hard coral within morphological categories (branching, plate, solitary, tabular, massive, foliose, encrusting) live soft coral, sponges, clams (Tridacna spp.), other invertebrates (such as ascidians and anemones), macro-algae, coral reef pavement, rock, rubble and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nNot all island groups could be surveyed in each year, usually due to funding limitations and unpredictable weather events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nThe data are contained within two worksheets of an Excel file (215 kB). All benthic data is in % cover, and fish data are in density (individuals per 1000 m2). The first worksheet shows the data averaged for each site, and the second worksheet has average values for each zone (Fished, NTR 1987 and NTR 2004).\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nNames in rounded brackets () are the matching names in the shapefile. This was done to meet the 10 character limitation of this format.\r\n\r\n- SE - Standard Error\r\n- mean - Mean over the transects at a site.\r\n- Total Fish Densit_mean (TFishDenMn)\r\n- Total Fish Densit_SE (TFishDenSE)\r\n- Fish Species richness_mean (FishRichMn)\r\n- Fish Species richness_SE (FishRichSE)\r\n- Fishery Target Spp_mean (FishTargMn) - Pooled group of fish species designated as 'Primary target¿ in the species list file. \r\n- Fishery Target Spp_SE (FishTargSE)\r\n- Grazers_mean (GrazersMn) - Pooled group of fish species listed as ¿grazers¿  in the species list\r\n- Grazers_SE (GrazersSE)\r\n- Corallivores_mean (CorallivMn)\r\n- Coraliivores_SE (CorallivSE)\r\n- Planktivores_mean (PlanktivMn)\r\n- Planktivores_SE (PlanktivSE)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_mean (TerrPomaMn)\r\n- Territorial Pomacentrids_SE (TerrPomaSE)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_mean (PlectSppMn)\r\n- Plectropomus spp_SE (PlectSppSE)\r\n- SCI_mean - Structural complexity Index..

Where an organisation has identified multiple outlets at one outlet address the Department has removed duplicate entries.\r\n\r\nEmergency Relief services are delivered by community organisations and help people address immediate basic needs by providing financial and/or material support in times of crisis.\r\n\r\nThe type of assistance offered by each organisation varies, however may include one-off assistance such as:\r\n\r\n* food, transport or chemist vouchers\r\n\r\n* part-payment of utility account/s\r\n\r\n* food parcels or clothing\r\n\r\n* budgeting assistance and/or\r\n\r\n* referrals to other services that help to address underlying causes of financial crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information has been extracted from data provided to the DSS by the Emergency Relief providers through the FOFMS online funding management portal.\r\n\r\nAs the nature of service delivery varies across regions, some community outreach services may not be reflected in the outlet information. The lead contracting organisation information may be presented in the data where sub-contracted organisations provide services. The address of some services such as those providing support or shelter to women escaping domestic violence have been withheld and outlet latitude/longitude coordinates assigned to the centre point of their SA3.\r\n\r\nFurther information about DSS funded services can be found at the DSS Grants Service Directory: http://serviceproviders.dss.gov.au/",

    "description": "The Joseph Bonaparte Gulf survey (SOL5117, GA survey #0325) was conducted on the R.V. Solander between 30 July and 30 September 2010 in collaboration with staff from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Museum and Art Gallery of Territory (MAGNT). This was a follow up survey from a survey in 2009 (SOL4934, GA survey #0322). The SOL5117 survey was undertaken under a Collaborative Agreement between GA and the AIMS. SOL5117 survey collected acoustic multibeam data (bathymetry and backscatter), sub-bottom profile data, as well as detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical) and biological (towed-video, benthic sled, Smith McIntyre grabs) data for seabed environments (banks, channels and plains) from 4 offshore grids along a N-S transect.  In addition, shipboard photographs were taken of barcoded biological specimens. The aims of the survey were to map, identify and investigate potential geohazards and unique, sensitive environments that relate to infrastructure; and to use exisitng data to evaluate the capacity to predict geohazards and sensitive environments.\n\nUnderwater video footage and still photographc images (12 megapixel resolution) from towed-video were collected from 46 (Leg 1) and 33 (Leg 2) stations, although quality varies among transects and some still images were not of suitable quality for analysis. Video and image files or associated parent folders are named by station number, gear code (CAM = underwater camera system) and then the deployment number. For example, 'stn48CAM35' would represent a video transect from Station 48 that was the 35th video transect on the survey.",

This information will be used to assess and map the vulnerability of biodiversity to the impacts of current and future extreme events in the Wet Tropics bioregion. The information gathered in the Wet Tropics can potentially be applied to other regions in Australia and elsewhere to predict and mitigate the impacts of extreme climatic events on biodiversity. Outcomes will include: Maps of exposure and the sensitivity of organisms to temperature extremes, identification of thermal hotspots and refugia and a list of biodiversity values particularly at risk from extreme events.\n\nThis project is now complete.",

The VPHS is an important\ncomponent of the population health surveillance capacity of the Department of\nHealth.\nThe VPHS has been conducted each year since 2001, and previously was based on\na sample of approximate 7500 adults aged 18 years and over, randomly selected\nfrom households in the state. In 2008, the sample was expanded to\napproximately 34,000 to enable analysis at the local government area (LGA)\nlevel. The VPHS is an ongoing source of high quality information on the health\nand wellbeing of Victorian adults. Further information about the VPHS,\nmethods, and previous survey reports can be found on Health Status of\nVictorians website.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The 18-O values of the different foraminiferal species down the depth of the core show relatively consistent inter-species offsets throughout the glacial and interglacial periods. This provides us with confidence that the 5 individual species presumably remained within the same water mass. Because each foraminifera species fractionate carbon and oxygen isotopes differently, amended 18-O values are given whenever possible to account for these well-known biological vital effects. Comparison of the 18-O values with SPECMAP (Martinson et al., 1987) provides us with a chronology for core GC12.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the total number of distinct specialist homeless services clients. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

    "description": "The NSW Bush Fire Prone Land dataset is a map prepared in accordance with the Guide for Bush Fire Prone Land Mapping (BFPL Mapping Guide) and certified by the Commissioner of NSW RFS under section 146(2) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. Over time there has been various releases of the BFPL Mapping Guide, in which the categories and types of vegetation included in the BFPL map have changed. The version of the guide under which, each polygon or LGA was certified is contained in the data. An area of land that can support a bush fire or is likely to be subject to bush fire attack, as designated on a bush fire prone land map. The definition of bushfire vegetation categories under guideline version 5b: \nVegetation Category 1 consists of: \n\nAreas of forest, woodlands, heaths (tall and short), forested wetlands and timber plantations. \nVegetation Category 2 consists of: \nRainforests. \nLower risk vegetation parcels. These vegetation parcels represent a lower bush fire risk to surrounding development and consist of: - Remnant vegetation; - Land with ongoing land management practices that actively reduces bush fire risk. \nVegetation Category 3 consists of: \nGrasslands, freshwater wetlands, semi-arid woodlands, alpine complex and arid shrublands. \nBuffers are created based on the bushfire vegetation, with buffering distance being 100 metres for vegetation category 1 and 30 metres for vegetation category 2 and 3. Vegetation excluded from the bushfire vegetation categories include isolated areas of vegetation less than one hectare, managed lands and some agricultural lands. Please refer to BFPL Mapping Guide for a full list of exclusions.The legislative context of this dataset is as follows: On 1 August 2002, the Rural Fires and Environmental Assessment Legislation Amendment Act 2002 (Amendment Act) came into effect.The Act amended both the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and the Rural Fire Services Act 1997 to ensure that people, property and the environment are more fully protected against the dangers that may arise from bushfires. Councils are required to map bushfire prone land within their local government area, which becomes the trigger for the consideration of bushfire protection measures when developing land. BFPL Mapping Guidelines are available from www.rfs.nsw.gov.au\nThis dataset is update upon certification of each LGA BFPL change or spot change.\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Alice Springs for 2018. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

The accuracy of the transducer is 1 in 10,000 of full scale over the calibrated temperature range.\nThe overall accuracy of the system is better than +/- 3 mm for a known water density.\nData is retrieved from the gauges by lowering a coil assembly on the end of a cable over a projecting knob on the top of the gauge and by use of an interface unit, a serial connection can be established to the gauge. Time setting and data retrieval can be then achieved.\n\nData has been retrieved from this gauge once since deployment. The records are complete since deployment.\n\nConversion of raw data to tidal records is done as detailed in document: Details of Conversion of Raw Data.\n\nLevelling\nOne attempts has been made at establishing an absolute height for this gauge using timed water level measurements.\n\nDocumentation dated 2008-10-17\nZhong Shan.\nThe battery in the submerged gauge at Zhong Shan has probably been exhausted. The gauge will be removed at an opportune time.\nThe gauge has not recently been download. There will still be some records available.",

The work can be broadly divided into four parts. 1. An autumn traverse where seismic reflection stations were established every 10 miles around a triangle with corners at Cape Folger, the Dome Centre and Cape Poinsett. 2. A mid winter traverse to the inland glaciology station S-2 for a programme of seismic ice velocity studies. 3. A spring traverse where a rectangular grid network of seismic, gravity, and elevation stations were installed in a region between S-2 and 80 miles south of S-2. 4. Two attempts at recording reflections off the Mohorovicic discontinuity shot in the vicinity of Wilkes.",

    "title": "Wamberal Lagoon Flood Study",
    "description": "Wamberal Lagoon is a small coastal lagoon within the Gosford City and Wyong Council Local\nGovernment areas (Figure 1). The lagoon has a surface area of approximately 0.5 square\nkilometres, and discharges to the Pacific Ocean at Wamberal Beach. The total catchment area\nto the Pacific Ocean is approximately 6.6 square kilometres and thus the area of the lagoon\nrepresents 8% of the total catchment.\n\nA number of properties surrounding the lagoon are very low lying, and flooding in the past has\ncaused damage and disruption. There has not been significant loss of property on any occasion\nin recent years. In an attempt to reduce the flood problems, Council mechanically opens the\nentrance when the lagoon approaches a critical level. This task of opening the lagoon to the\nocean during floods can be both difficult and at times dangerous. The ocean and channel\nentrance conditions appropriate to design flood conditions were therefore major considerations\nin the study.\n\nIn the last 30 years the catchment has changed from a predominantly rural community to a more\nurbanised community. The lagoon and part of the adjoining foreshore have been dedicated as\nthe Wamberal Lagoon Nature Reserve and there has been an increase in population and a\nheightened awareness of environmental issues. These changes have affected the lagoon and\nthere is the potential for further changes. There is a need therefore to define the existing flood\nproblem and carefully manage future development within the catchment and upon the\nfloodplain.\n\nAs the first stage in the development of an overall Floodplain Management Plan for Wamberal\nLagoon, Gosford City Council engaged Webb, McKeown &amp; Associates to prepare a Flood\nStudy.\n\nThe primary objectives of this Flood Study are to:\n<ul>\n<li>determine the flood behaviour of Wamberal Lagoon and its tributaries under existing\nconditions,</li>\n<li>set up a numerical model of the catchment to determine flood flows velocities and\nlevels for design events,</li>\n<li>formulate  the  model  such  that  the  effects  on  flood  behaviour  of  catchment\ndevelopment and flood mitigation options can be investigated.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Flood Study does not consider local flooding which may result from inadequate urban\ndrainage provisions. These issues are being examined in other separate studies undertaken\nby Council.\n\nThis report details the results and findings of the Flood Study.  The key elements are:\n<ul>\n<li>a summary of available data,</li>\n<li>reasons for the choice of hydrologic and hydraulic models,</li>\n<li>calibration of these models,</li>\n<li>establishment of design flood behaviour,</li>\n<li>sensitivity analyses of the adopted parameters.</li>\n</ul>\n\nA number of previous studies have been undertaken in the local area. A compilation of all\nrelevant previous reports is contained in Reference 1 and several of these are discussed in\ndetail in Section 2.3. All levels in this Report are to Australian Height Datum (AHD). AHD is the\ncommon national plane approximating mean sea level.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who gave birth and had at least one antenatal visit in the first trimester, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAn antenatal visit is a planned visit between a pregnant woman and a midwife or doctor to assess and improve the wellbeing of the mother and baby throughout pregnancy. An antenatal visit does not include a visit where the sole purpose of contact is to confirm the pregnancy, or those contacts that occurred during the pregnancy that related to other non-pregnancy related issues. An antenatal visit in the first trimester is defined as occurring before 14 weeks' gestational age.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid\n\n\nIn WA and ACT, first antenatal visits that occur outside of the hospital may not be included, so these data should be interpreted with caution\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a recorded week of gestation at the first antenatal visit for the area is less than 100\n\n",

Survey data and reports.\n\nSandMap Pty Ltd has been contracted by Moreton Bay Regional Council to undertake investigation surveys into two sites located close offshore from the Redcliffe Peninsula, QLD. These surveys will inform coastal modelling currently being undertaken as part of coastal design projects and may also be used to set-out coastal protection structures such as groyne extensions and seawalls encroaching below the low tide mark.\n\n\n\n\nThe project design levels were based on the Australian Height Datum (AHD).\nAll reported depths for charted hydrographic surveys are referenced to Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) and related to MSQ tidal stations at Scarborough Boat Harbour and Woody Point. In the survey area, LAT is 1.23m below AHD as established by MSQ and referred to in a 2016 hydrographic survey (Plan 133106).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who went to any hospital emergency department for their own health in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months from April to December for 2001 and includes the total over the months. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates. The 2019 and 2018 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "Remotely sensed topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) information were acquired targeted sections of the NSW coast (Tweed Heads, Byron Bay, Port Stephens, Central Coast) using Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB - a combination of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) sensors) during June - July 2011. This resource is a shapefile that defines the combined extent (428 km2) for the four surveyed areas. Data were acquired by Fugro Pty Ltd on behalf of NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (now NSW Department of Planning and Environment) using a Riegl VQ-820-G ALB (LiDAR) and Fugro LADS High-Definition sensors aboard sub-contracted Corporate Air Cessna C441 (VH-VEH). Funding was provided through NSW Office of Environment and Heritage with an objective to acquire high quality, high resolution baseline data to support coastal erosion studies The survey requirement was to provide data at a minimum of 5 x 5 m laser spot spacings from the mean high-water mark to a minimum of 200m inland, and from the shore, seaward (LADS - bathymetry) to the point of laser extinction (~30m water depth depending on in-water conditions). Positioning data were collected on the ellipsoid ITRF 2014 GRS80 in UTM Z56 and post-processed using local base stations (CORSnet NSW) to provide a Post Processed Kinematic GNSS solution for final aircraft trajectory before being applied to all data. Data types available are as GeoTiff (L3) transformed to GDA94 Z56. Other data types may be available as ESRI topo-bathy rasters and contours, tab delimited ascii XYZ, relative reflectance data (terrestrial, marine) and Quality Control (QC) documentation (contained within survey report) via the NSW DCCEEW Information Asset Register (IAR) (metadata, coverage shape), SEED (https://seed.nsw.gov.au  or upon request. The data are intended to inform coastal and marine management and are ‘not for navigation’.",

    "description": "This record describes, and links to a working paper produced through the Resource Management in Asia-Pacific (RMAP) Program based at The Australian National University in Canberra.\n*****\nThe Indonesian Government argues that the sea bridges the many islands and different peoples of Indonesia. Politically, this might be appropriate as a means of encouraging people to think that wherever and whoever there are, they are united as Indonesians. However, when this ideology is used for maritime resource management, it creates problems. One issue derives from the fact that people do not think that the Indonesian sea is 'free for all' Indonesians. I will argue that people, however vaguely, talk about 'we' and 'they' in defining who has the right to a particular fishing ground and who should be excluded. By analyzing conflicts that have taken part in different places in Indonesia, I will demonstrate that ethnicity and regionalism have been used as the defining factor of 'We' and 'They.' In particular contexts, ethnicity and regionalism define whether fishermen can access marine resources. Thus, at the practical level the sea does not unite Indonesians, and it is in fact, ethnicity and regionalism that divides the Indonesian seas.",

    "description": "This data set extends the MDBA published Murray-Darling Basin managed floodplain (https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/murray-darling-basin-managed-floodplain) to include all areas watered with Commonwealth environmental water 2014-2021. Areas that are added are mapped by polygons from the ANAE classification of the Murray-Darling Basin data set that were identified as receiving inundation by Commonwealth environmental water by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder’s (CEWH) Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019) and the first two years of the Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (Flow-MER) program.\r\n\r\nThe MDBA published Murray-Darling Basin managed floodplain (https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/murray-darling-basin-managed-floodplain) is a spatial data set that estimates the extent of the Murray-Darling Basin that can be influenced by environmental water under the Basin Plan. It includes:\r\n\r\n* actively managed areas that can receive environmental water via large headwater storages or via The Living Murray ‘environmental works’ sites on the River Murray floodplain\r\n* passively managed areas that receive environmental water via flow rules in water resource plans or via natural events\r\n* areas that may be inundated with high flows if key constraints are overcome\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. For more information on methods and reporting using these data see https://www.dcceew.gov.au/water/cewo/monitoring/mer-program\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program participants acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWH Flow-MER (2022) Flow-MER MDB managed floodplain.

    "title": "AIHW - Mental Health Services - Emergency Department Presentations by Demographics (SA3) 2014-2018",
    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of emergency department presentations in public hospitals by patient demographics and location. Mental health-related emergency department (ED) presentations are defined as presentations to public hospital EDs that have a principal diagnosis of mental and behavioural disorders. However, the definition does not fully capture all potential mental health-related presentations to EDs such as intentional self-harm, as intent can be difficult to identify in an ED environment and can also be difficult to code. The data spans the financial years of 2014-2018 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nState and territory health authorities collect a core set of nationally comparable information on most public hospital ED presentations in their jurisdiction, which is compiled annually into the National Non-Admitted Patient Emergency Department Care Database (NNAPEDCD). The data reported for 2014–15 to 2017–18 is sourced from the NNAPEDCD. Information about mental health-related services provided in EDs prior to 2014–15 was supplied directly to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) by states and territories.\nMental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. MHSA is updated progressively throughout each year as data becomes available. The data accompanies the Mental Health Services - In Brief 2018 Web Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Mental health services in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCaution is required when conducting time-series analyses. The data source changed in 2014–15 from data provided by state and territory health authorities (2004–05 to 2013–14) to the NNAPEDCD. Additionally, due to the methodology applied for mapping the data over time, years prior to 2017–18 may be an undercount or data may not be displayed where SA3s have changed over time.\n\n\nMental health-related emergency department presentations included in this report are those that had a principal diagnosis that fell within the Mental and behavioural disorders chapter (Chapter 5) of ICD-10-AM (codes F00–F99) or the equivalent ICD-9-CM or SNOMED codes. It does not include codes for self-harm or poisoning.\n\n\nFrom 2014–15 onwards, diagnosis information was not reported using a uniform classification. The mapping of SNOMED codes (used by NSW) to ICD-10AM may lead to an under-estimation of mental health-related presentations.\n\n\nChanges in the volume of patients over time for NSW may be attributed, in part, to the increased number of hospitals included in the data for this jurisdiction.\n\n",

The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nHousehold projections show the number of households that would form if demographic trends continue and if assumptions about living arrangements are realised over the projection period. A household is two or more people who share a dwelling (house, apartment, townhouse, caravan, etc.) and share food and cooking facilities, and other essentials. Household projections show the future number and type of households living in private dwellings. Private dwellings are self-contained accommodation such as houses, apartments, mobile homes or other substantial structures. It does not include accommodation such as boarding houses, nursing homes or prisons.\nThe household projections also include the implied dwelling demand for those households.  This is the likely number of private dwellings needed to accommodate future population-driven demand.\nFor more information please read the Household Projections User Guide.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nHousehold and dwelling numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. They should not be taken to be accurate to that level of detail.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\n<strong>Moreton Bay City Flood Database</strong>\nRiver and Creek Flooding\nVersion 3.1.0 (October 2023)\nThis theme shows river and creek flooding caused by long duration heavy rainfall, typically lasting between 1 hour and 1 day. Sometimes this rain falls over a whole catchment or a number of catchments. This extended period of heavy rainfall causes the water levels in the river or creek to rise and escape the main channel. It may take a number of hours or days for these floodwaters to rise, reach a peak and then subside.&nbsp;\n<i>Existing Conditions Maximum Scenario:</i>&nbsp;Maximum of modelled flood behaviour in rivers and creeks for different design rainfall events under existing climate and catchment conditions&nbsp;- with and without structure (bridges and culverts) blockage.&nbsp;\n<i>Purpose</i>:&nbsp;To determine flood levels and flows for different design rainfall events for design of infrastructure&nbsp;with and without bridges and culverts being blocked by debris.\n<i>Methodology:</i>&nbsp;Coupled hydrologic (WBNM) and hydraulic (TUFLOW) modelling using a two-dimensional regular grid, 1D culvert structures, 2D bridge structures and a design burst rainfall approach&nbsp;based on Australian Rainfall and Runoff 2019 guideline (ARR2019). Blockage calculated based on ARR2019 recommendations.&nbsp;<i>Refer technical publications available from Council's website for further detail.</i>&nbsp;\n<i>Flood Height:&nbsp;</i>Indicates the approximate water surface level of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event, expressed in metres above mean sea level. This dataset represents the flood height values as contour lines using a contour interval of 0.2m.\n<i>Modelled Probability:</i>&nbsp;The dataset includes three possible flood events of different probability.\n<i>Likelihood: Likely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 5%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 20 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood:&nbsp;Possible</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):&nbsp;1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):&nbsp;100 Year</i>\n<i>Likelihood: Unlikely</i><i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): 0.1%</i><i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI): 1,000 Year: 0.1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year</i>\n<i>Version Notes&nbsp;3.1.0</i>&nbsp;- First edition of Generation 3 models, incorporating 2019 LiDAR, ARR2019 for Hydrology and TUFLOW HPC for Hydraulic modelling. All ARIs and all aspects. (BCR 5yr, 10yr, 50yr and 2000yr runs completed by CMB). BYR and MAR no structure blockage only. MAR ARR hazard calculated using WaterRIDE.

Model does not include underground structures however rainfall was scaled down to account for the possibility of some run-off being contained within the underground system. A post-process was applied to eliminate areas of shallow depth, low velocity and low velocity depth product. Additional removal of model errors and small property intersects using spatial analysis and manual techniques.<i>Existing Conditions Scenario:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Modelled estimate of the extent of overland flow paths following a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability storm outside the river and creek flood extent and with some model errors and small property intersects removed.<i>Purpose:</i>&nbsp;To determine flood extent along overland flowpaths in areas outside the extent of the river and creek flood modelling. Suitable for public dissemination.<i>Flood Extent:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indicates the approximate extent of potential inundation during a computer-modelled flood event (not actual recorded levels). The inundation area may be less accurate where the property is flat near the outer limit of inundation, or where the ground surface has been modified since being surveyed.This dataset represents the flood extent as vector polygons without attribution.<i>Modelled Probability:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The probability of flooding represented by this dataset is:&nbsp;1% Chance of Flooding in Any One Year<i>Likelihood:</i>&nbsp;Possible<i>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP):</i>&nbsp;1%<i>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI):</i>&nbsp;100 YearA large uncommon flood event that is rarely observed but neverthess still possible. Over a long period of time an event of similar size may occur on average once every 100 years. It is therefore likely an event of this size will occur at least once during a single lifetime. It is less likely, but still possible, for a flood of this size to occur more than once in a single lifetime. A flood event of similar size occurred in the middle and upper reaches of the Caboolture River during January 2011.<i>Version Notes&nbsp;1.25.0 - Sub set of F01 Version 1.24 with areas removed where field Public = N in F00N Version 1.18.8 (April 2025)</i><i>Version Resolution: 1.0m</i><i>Data Reliability: D</i><i>Indicates that Council can only provide an extent but not levels as the flood data is of limited reliability</i>\n<i><strong>Further Information</strong></i><i>For additional information on flooding in the Moreton Bay Region please see Council's website </i><a href=\"https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Services/Property-Ownership/Flooding\">Flood information for residents of Moreton Bay - City of Moreton Bay</a>",

It also returns real-time data for metropolitan train, tram and bus services (where this data is made available to PTV), as well as disruption information, stop facility information, and access to myki ticket outlet data.\nNEW: PTV has created a new version of the PTV Timetable API – Version 3, documented in Swagger.\nVersion 2 of the PTV Timetable API has also been updated.\nA migration guide has also been created to assist API users moving from Version 2 to Version 3.\nTrain timetable data is updated daily, while the remaining data is updated weekly, taking into account any planned timetable changes (for example, due to holidays or planned disruptions). The PTV timetable API is the same API used by PTV for its apps. To access the most up to date data PTV has (including real-time data), you must use the API dynamically.\nFrequently Asked Questions: http://ptv.vic.gov.au/apifaq\nAll information about how to use the API is in the Swagger (for Version 3) or the documentation (for Version 2). PTV cannot provide technical support for the API.",

Agricultural climate metrics focus on climate conditions that are important to Australian agricultural productivity, for example the annual number of heat stress days for livestock or total growing season rainfall for grain cropping. The metrics are evaluated for a historical baseline (2001-2020) and global warming levels (GWLs) 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Data are provided in netCDF format, and each grid location gives the minimum, median, and maximum metric values across the ensemble of global climate models climate models for each GWL, as well as the mean of the historical period. Projection data are provided for values (e.g. total rainfall in mm) as well as change from the mean historical baseline (e.g. % change in rainfall from historical baseline). \n\nMore information can be found in the technical report¹. \n<ol>\n<li>Darbyshire R, Blamey L, Bolt A, Brodie S, Buhagiar L, Bustamante RH, Greenwood S, Holzworth D, Hopper M, Huth N, Keogh T, Mayberry D, Nidumolu U, Paroz A, Rich J, Rosauer D, Roxburgh S, Thomas I and van Herwaarden A (2025).

    "description": "This dataset is the 2016 release of the Victoria in Future series of data and presents Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for the state of Victoria. The data is presented in 2015 Victoria in Future Small Area (VIFSA) boundaries and covers each year for the years 2011 to 2031.\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for Local Government Areas (LGA) and VIFSAs for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).\nVIFSAs are:\n\n\nsmaller than LGAs and fit entirely within them\n\n\nlarge enough to avoid the uncertainty attached to some projections at SA2 level\n\n\nas far as possible distinct from ABS classification, so as to avoid confusion and misinterpretations.\n\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.\nFor more information please visit the DELWP VIF Portal.\nNotes: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nThese detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).\n\n\nThe base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.\n\n",

    "description": "AUV Sirius (IMOS Platform code: SIRIUS) spent two weeks in Tasmania in October 2008 surveying sites as part of the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facility (CERF) Marine Biodiversity Research Hub.  \n\nThe AUV deployments focused on sites along the Tasman Peninsula in South East Tasmania and in the Huon Marine Protected Area (MPA).  The objective of the cruise was to describe biological assemblages associated with rocky reef systems in deep shelf waters beyond normal diving depths. Detailed multibeam mapping of the survey areas had been undertaken prior to the AUV deployment to determine suitable survey locations and to identify any hazards to operation. \n\nAt each location, multiple reefs were selected for detailed survey work at a range of depths from approximately 50 m to 150 m.  Dive profiles were designed to include sufficient replication to quantitatively determine abundances of key species/features within depth strata, within reefs, between reefs (km to 100 km scale), and between differing levels of reef complexity.  \n\nOver the course of the 10 days of operation, the vehicle undertook 19 dives and visited all the sites of interest identified prior to the voyage.  At the conclusion of the trip the dataset included over 1TB of geotiff imagery, multibeam, AUV tracks, 3D textured meshes and hydrographical data.\n\nThe sites visited in October 2008 were:\n- Waterfall Bay\n- O'Hara Reef\n- Patch-Reef-North\n- Hippo North\n- Chevron Rock\n- Little Hippo North\n- Little Hippo South East\n- Hippo South\n- Chevron Rock South\n- Blowhole\n- Sisters\n- Port Arthur Channel\n- Port Arthur Patch-Reef\n- High Yellow\n- Butt's Reef\n- Zuid Pool\n- Butt's Pockmarks",

The present study updates the classification and mapping of 30 communities, with the updated mapping provided in digital form for inclusion in the council's GIS. The survey area included all of the Hornsby LGA, from Eastwood to Brooklyn to Wisemans Ferry, excluding Marramarra NP, Muogamarra NR, Long Island NR, and Ku-ring-gai Chase NP east of the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway.\nIn the initial study, the classification of the plant communities was based on the floristic composition of the tallest vegetation layer (usually the tree species composition). The assessment was subjective but based on species data from a total of 404 sample sites. An additional 209 sites were examined for the updated study. The classification has been refined to include 8 EECs, two rainforest communities (instead of one in the original classification), and recognition of the distinctive vegetation of Dangar Island as a separate community.

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

    "description": "AusCPR: Phytoplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The phytoplankton abundance data are analysed as per Richardson et al 2006. Phytoplankton are usually counted from water samples after settling but in the CPR analysis we count the phytoplankton in situ. With CPR samples, the phytoplankton is captured by the mesh and are caught by the silk strands, by phytoplankton mucilage, and/or by other organisms on the silk. It is thus possible to see the phytoplankton cells directly on the mesh. In essence, the phytoplankton is already concentrated. Washing the phytoplankton off the silks to count in the standard manner may result in loss of or damage to cells before analysis.\n\nIt is advised that anyone using the data should first read this methodology or contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A laboratories in Queensland and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.  For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank.

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\nJP – 2090 RCP 4.5 – Juvenile period as years until 50% of individuals in the population have \nflowered under future conditions (30-year period centred on 2090) with the RCP 4.5 emissions \nscenario based on a model featuring annual precipitation.

    "description": "**Please note  this dataset is an archived version of the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF). For the latest version of the G-NAF please go to this url: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf**\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGeoscape G-NAF is Australia’s authoritative, geocoded address file. It is built and maintained by [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/) using authoritative government data. Further information about contributors to G-NAF is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nG-NAF is one of the most ubiquitous and powerful spatial datasets. It contains more than 15 million Australian physical address records. The records include geocodes, which are latitude and longitude map coordinates. G-NAF does not contain personal information or details relating to individuals.\r\n\r\nUpdated versions of G-NAF are published on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\nUsers have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing either GDA94 or GDA2020 datums.\r\n\r\n**Changes in the August 2025 release**\r\n\r\n* Nationally, the August 2025 update of G-NAF shows an overall increase of 40,716 addresses (0.30%). The total number of addresses in G-NAF now stands at 15,794,643 of which 14,950,491 or 94.66% are principal.\r\n\r\n* In the ACT, there have been minor updates to the address parsing of flat-numbered addresses aimed at: improving the address representation of flat-numbered addresses; improving address coverage; and improving address alignment between contributors. This change affects approximately 4,000 addresses.\r\n\r\n* A small number of additional address sites have implemented the use of the BUILDING_NAME attribute as part of the merge criteria to improve address coverage for flat-numbered addresses in NSW and QLD. These changes have resulted in the creation of approximately 400 addresses in NSW and 120 in QLD.\r\n\r\n* A focus has been applied to Tasmanian street-locality addresses to reduce the number of these addresses. For the August 2025 release, there is a reduction of some 900 street-locality addresses in Tasmania.\r\n\r\n* Geoscape has moved product descriptions, guides and reports online to https://docs.geoscape.com.au.\r\n\r\nFurther information on G-NAF, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/g-naf) or through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/).

Where a road segement has multiple names, TR_ROAD_REGISTER will have multiple overlappling road lines while TR_ROAD will have one road with multiple names.\n\nTR_ROAD_REGISTER facilitates road searching and efficent road name lablelling.\n\nIn addition the dataset has an atttribute MIN_CLASS_CODE which is the the minimum CLASS_CODE for all TR_ROAD road lines that have the unique cominbination of identifer vaules.  For example, if the road segments associated with the unique road identifer have CLASS_CODES of 0  (Freeway), 1 (Highway) and 2 (Arterial), the MIN_CLASS_CODE of that road will be 0 (Freeway).   This value faciliates feature filtering at different scales and symbolisation.",

It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from the National Mortality Database (NMD) and includes data supplied by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages, the Coroners and the National Coroners Information System and coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nYear or period refers to the year of death registration.\n\n\nDeaths have been combined over a 5 year period due to small numbers.\n\n\nDeath and population counts are annual averages for the 5-year period between 2011 and 2015. They were derived by dividing the total count for the period by 5. Rates are based on the combined deaths and populations over the 5-year period.\n\n",

    "description": "We have made the first direct detection of an ultra-long period magnetar, using a low-frequency sky survey performed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). Its radio emission is highly polarised and periodic on a timescale of ~20 minutes. Its dynamic spectrum shows high-fluence narrow-timescale “spikes” which are unresolved by our data, with fluence approaching the Fast Radio Bursts generated by the\nGalactic centre magnetar. The source was visible in Q1 2018 but has since entered a quiescent state. In the event that it switches back on, we requre follow-up of this source to determine an accurate position, a wide-band spectral index, a precise dispersion measure, determination of its polarisation properties at high frequencies, and to better understand the emission on short timescales. Therefore, we are requesting triggered observations with ATCA and Parkes based on MWA monitoring. This semester we request to extend the triggering criterion to any similar source detected in an upcoming monitoring campaign of the Galactic plane using the MWA.",

    "description": "Wellman (1971) has presented erroneous data relating to lineaments in Papua New Guinea. The main faults and folds in Papua New Guinea as determined by ground and remote sensing surveys by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, the Geological Survey of Papua New Guinea and by oil exploration companies are shown on the new BMR - GSPNG 1:1,000,000 Scale geological map of Papua New Guinea.\n\nWellman (1971) in a recent issue of this journal produced an account of fault systems in the Pacific region. However, his Figure 5and related text (p.205) cannot go unchallenged in so far as they refer to the eastern part of the island of New Guinea, i.e., Papua New Guinea.\n\nAn example of the inaccuracy of Figure 5 (Wellman, 1971), is the omission of major faults such as the Owen Stanley Fault (Fig.1) and the Frieda Fault (Fig.2), and the depiction of a non-existent major fault system (which he called the New Guinea Fault).\n\nExhaustive examinations of airphotos, both vertical and oblique, at scales from 1:20,000 to 1:80,000, and of side-looking airborne radarimagery, by numerous officers of the Bureau of Mineral Resources and theGeological Survey of Papua New Guinea during the last 5 - 10 years have failed to detect the lineations shown by Wellman. Furthermore, these studies, and extensive field mapping by government and oil exploration company geologists over the last 25 years, have revealed the existence\nof the fault and fold systems shown here in Figures 3a and 4.\n\nAlthough a strike slip type of movement is suspected for some of these faults only vertical movements have been proved. Thus the sinistral movement claimed for the imagined \"New Guinea Fault\" should not be regarded as typical of the fault system of Papua New Guinea.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

This is a proportion of those who consented to participate in the On Track survey within the school.\nMoreover, the information about the survey as well as the annual results (current and historical) are also available from DET website (https://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/research/Pages/ontrack.aspx), where the datasets are listed and available in the Data and reports &gt; Year 12 completers summary section.",

Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

The dataset is presented by 2011 Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) boundaries following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA) publishes Greater Capital Cities Statistical Area (GCCSA) and SA3 breakdowns of the number of debtors with business and non-business related personal insolvencies on a quarterly basis, using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nExplanatory notes can be found at AFSA Regional Statistics \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAFSA suppressed the data for regions with small numbers of individuals to protect the privacy and confidentiality of insolvent debtors. Whenever necessary to suppress data, cells are nulled. Generally, AFSA publishes data with three or more debtors.\n\n\nRegional personal insolvency activity statistics are reported based on the number of debtors.\n\n\nState totals include 'Other (not in ASGS).\n\n\nAURIN has added month and year columns for filtering purposes\n\n",

It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp. Other Territories (LGA code 99399) were split across two records in the original data, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally On Track (N) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=2\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 2 in this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally On Track (%) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=10\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 10 in this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally At Risk (N) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=2\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 2 in this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally At Risk (%) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=10\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 10 in this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (N) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=2\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 2 in this dataset.\n\n\nKowanyama (S) (LGA code 34420) results for \"Developmentally Vulnerable (%) 2018\" had a value of \"&gt;=90\" in the original data, it has been assigned a value of 90 in this dataset.\n\n",

The policy and guidelines do not apply to noise from existing railways or major roads in the vicinity of an existing noise-sensitive land use, or an increase in traffic along an existing railway or major road in the absence of a major redevelopment.\n\nIt is expected that a review of the operation and effectiveness of the policy would be conducted within two years of the commencement of the policy.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of statistics related to the leading causes of death by sex. The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nCause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\n\n\nYear refers to the year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of the cause of death data; deaths registered in 2014 are based on revised version; deaths registered in 2015 and 2016 are based on preliminary versions. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.\n\n\nCause of death information are based on the underlying cause of death and are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Deaths registered in 1997 onwards are classified according to the 10th revision (ICD-10).\n\n\nUnknown/missing includes deaths where place of usual residence was overseas, no fixed abode, offshore and migratory, and undefined. Summary measures and cause of death data are not presented for any SA4 with less than 10 deaths in a single year.\n\n\nPopulation counts are based on estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Australian estimated resident population data are sourced from Australian demographic statistics (ABS cat. no. 3101.0).\n\n",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for February 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

This has been calculated with the number of females who had a third or fourth-degree perineal laceration after giving birth vaginally, divided by the number of females who gave birth vaginally, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2013-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nBirths included are vaginal births, including non-instrumental and instrumental births.\n\n\nBirths excluded are caesarean sections.\n\n\nThird-degree laceration is defined as perineal laceration, rupture or tear as in second-degree laceration occurring during delivery, also involving: anal sphincter, rectrovaginal septum, and sphincter not otherwise specified.

    "title": "ACTGOV Mature Tree 2020 Crowns",
    "description": "This dataset shows mature tree crown polygons across Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) derived from 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model. Mature Tree crowns are defined as those larger than 100m2 canopy footprint, and higher than 8 metres tall. Includes native and non-native tree representation and estimates height. Also see <a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1c62bf7c475748afb1ca5b1ae2239afd\">Mature Tree Centre Points.</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Methods:</strong>\nThe canopy dataset is derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data captured by Aerometrex and the ACT Government (<a href=\"https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/\">available here</a>) at 12ppm over the ACT and region in April 2020. Tree crowns were delineated using a one metre 2020 LiDAR Canopy Height Model (CHM) via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynn 2004; Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020).A 3X3 low pass smoothing algorithm was applied to the CHM raster. The CHM was then loaded into R and manipulated using the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel 2020). A variable window filter, which was used in parallel with watershed segmentation, was applied to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The following metrics was used for the variable window:function(x){((x^2)* 0.009 + 2.5)}. A minimum height of 3 metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The watershed segmentation method was implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting segmented raster was converted to a simplified polygon layer, and joined with the treetops point layer. Polygons smaller than 3 square metres were removed. Tree crown polygons larger than 100m2 and higher than 8 metres were filtered as &quot;mature trees&quot;. Dataset represents native and non-native species.\n\n\n\n<b>Tree Crown Delineation Method</b>\nThe inverse watershed delineation (IWD) method is the popular technique for segmenting individual tree crowns using LIDAR data (Marcu, et al., 2017) (Wannassiri, et al., 2013). LiDAR-based IWD methods have been successfully applied in conifer-dominated systems, while broadleaf-dominated systems have proven to be more challenging (Hastings, et al., 2020). A common problem with the IWD method is the overestimation of tree crowns, especially in dense tree stands. This problem can be partially overcome by a) aggressively filtering the data, and b) using a variable window filter (VWF) algorithm to detect dominant treetops, which then feeds into the IWD.\nIn this project, 2015 and 2020 tree crowns were delineated from the respective CHM’s, via a marker-controlled watershed delineation method (Popescu &amp; Wynne, 2004) implemented via the ForestTools R-package (Plowright &amp; Roussel, 2021). The R-code used in this project is included in metadata lineage.\nA variable window filter was applied within the ForestTools package to determine locations of treetops. This algorithm employs a variable moving window for the CHM to filter pixels, and the highest value within the window is regarded as a treetop. The size of the moving window differs and depends on the positive relationship between crown width and tree height. The derivation of the appropriate window size to search for treetops is based on the assumption that there is a relationship between the height of the trees and their crown size. The higher the trees, the larger the crown size.\nVarious functions were tested to define the window search radius, including simple linear functions. The function described by Popescu &amp; Wynne was eventually chosen to inform the window search radius of the tree top detection algorithm, as it achieved the best results for mature trees.\nA minimum height of three metres was set for the treetop detection algorithm. The resulting dataset, which contained attributes for unique tree identifiers, tree height and moving window size, was saved as a point shapefile. The IWD method was then implemented within the ForestTools R-package to outline tree crowns, using the previously identified treetops as markers. The resulting raster dataset contained unique identifies corresponding with the tree tops point dataset. The ensuing segmented rasters were converted to polygon layers and joined with the treetops point layers.\n\n<b>Delineated Tree Crown Model Validation</b>\nMap products produced by remote sensing analysis typically uses ‘ground truth’ to determine accuracy. In practice, accuracy assessments evaluate the remote sensing-derived map product relative to some higher quality determination of the map. These higher quality data, referred to as ‘reference data’, is compared to the map product using statistical sampling (Stehman, 2009).\nValidation of the 2015 mature tree crown polygons was done by randomly selecting 40 points from the dataset and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons (digitized from 2015 aerial photography). The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 32 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 8 of the reference polygons. The overestimation of the canopy projective area by the delineation model can be partly attributed to the low pass filter that was used to smooth the canopy height model during the delineation process, which effectively added pixels to the perimeter of tree crowns in the CHM.\nA similar process was followed to validate the 2020 mature tree crown model, using the same 40 randomly selected points and checking them against manually digitized crown area polygons from 2020 aerial photography. The validation showed that the model tended to overestimate the tree canopy area for 33 of the reference polygons, while underestimating the tree canopy area for 7 of the reference polygons.\nAlso see\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2f277dfd24964ef3943d99b34c38ebad\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 1m - Districts - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://actgov.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2eb04c29f971499aa3aebe4abaa36059\">ACTGOV Canopy Cover 2020 Statistics - Overview (arcgis.com)</a></li></ul>\n\nReferences:\nPlowright, A &amp; J Roussel.

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",
