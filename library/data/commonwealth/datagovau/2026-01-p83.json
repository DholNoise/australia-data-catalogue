    "description": "Pedestrian involved accidents constitute a significant proportion of all traffic accidents, and the number of injuries per accident in pedestrian accidents is approximately three times the number of other types of traffic accidents. As with other types of accidents, pedestrian accident countermeasures can be applied to the human body, the vehicle and the environment, during the pre-crash, crash and post-crash phases. This paper is primarily concerned with reducing injuries to pedestrians through a study of the vehicle during the crash phase of pedestrian accidents.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> This resource was originally published on opengov.nsw.gov.au.

    "description": "This experiment tested the effects of secondary treated sewage effluent on infaunal assemblages that were collected 50m from a sewage outfall ('outfall' assemblage). Twelve intact sediment cores were collected from this site on the Western Treatment Plant foreshore (Port Phillip Bay, Victoria) and brought back to the laboratory. Four cores were assigned to each of three treatments, which were no dose of effluent, high dose (7mls effluent per minute) or a 'no escape' treatment. The experiment ran for 13 days in December 1999. Throughout the experimental period, dissolved oxygen levels were measured and animals that migrated from the sediment were collected, counted and identified. At the end of the experiment, infauna remaining in the sediment were counted and identified and the wet weight biomass of each species group was recorded.",

These include dinosaur tracks, other ichnofossils and plant macrofossils in the Lower Cretaceous Broome Sandstone, along with associated geological features that provide insights into the depositional environments represented by this rock unit. A suite of overlying and adjacent Pleistocene and Holocene geological units preserving other heritage-listed ichnofossils also occur in these areas. \nAreas preserving features that are relevant to The West Kimberly National Heritage listing are subject to protection under the federal EPBC Act.\nThis dataset originates from observations performed by The University of Queensland’s Dinosaur Lab and is compiled and published through the DCNHMP (2025) project.\nThe DCNHMP project area is approximately 50km of the intertidal zone (the area between highest astronomical tide and lowest astronomical tide) around the town of Broome. The project area extends 15km east-southeast from Broome along the northern shore of Roebuck Bay to Crab Creek and southwest then north away from Broome along the Dampier Peninsula coastline to conclude 25km northwest of Broome at Willie Creek.\nThis dataset is one of three datasets produced by the DCNHMP.

    "description": "The iron Staining Risk theme is divided into two categories:\n\n1) High risk\n2) Low risk\n\nHigh Risk:\nThe iron staining classification represents areas delineated as having an elevated iron / manganese staining risk according to data available at the time of publication. The map does not include all locations that may have iron staining potential. Groundwater staining is commonly caused by the presence of ferric iron in the groundwater (refer to section on groundwater staining), however staining is also caused by manganese and calcium. This set was developed for ‘Perth Groundwater Atlas (2nd Edition), 2004’.\n\nLow Risk: \nGenerally areas away from present or past wetlands with neutral to alkaline pH's will tend to be low in iron concentration. As soil strata are highly variable, neighbourhood bores should be checked to confirm the status of local iron staining risk.\n\nNotes:\nThe accuracy of the 'Perth Groundwater Atlas (2nd Edition), 2004' is limited by the number of sampled monitoring bores. A high density of monitoring bores is generally associated with well-developed suburbs. A reduction in the density occurs in the outlying areas of the Atlas, such as those locations close to the Darling Scarp in the eastern edge of the dataset,\nor in the southern portions of the map sheet.\n\nThis dataset was formerly known as Iron Staining Risk (DOW-063)",

    "description": "## **Abstract** \n\nThis dataset and its metadata statement were supplied to the Bioregional Assessment Programme by a third party and are presented here as originally supplied.\n\n\n\nThis is Version 1 of the Australian Soil Clay product of the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia.\n\n          \n\nThe Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia has produced a range of digital soil attribute products. Each product  contains six digital soil attribute maps, and their upper and lower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths: 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm. These depths are consistent with the specifications of the GlobalSoilMap.net project (http://www.globalsoilmap.net/). The digital soil attribute maps are in raster format at a resolution of 3 arc sec (approximately 90 x 90 m pixels).\n\n          \n\nThese maps are generated by combining the best available Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) products available across Australia.\n\n          \n\nAttribute Definition: 2 micrometre mass fraction of the less than 2 mm soil material determined using the pipette method;\n\nUnits: %;\n\nPeriod (temporal coverage; approximately): 1950-2013;\n\nSpatial resolution: 3 arc seconds (approx 90m);\n\nTotal number of gridded maps for this attribute: 18;\n\nNumber of pixels with coverage per layer: 2007M (49200 x 40800);\n\nTotal size before compression: about 8GB;\n\nTotal size after compression: about 4GB;\n\nData license : Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC By);\n\nTarget data standard: GlobalSoilMap specifications;\n\nFormat: GeoTIFF.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe National Digital Soil Property Maps are generated by combining the best available digital soil mapping to calculate a variance weighted mean for each pixel. Two DSM methods have been utilised across and in various parts of Australia, these being:\n\n              \n\n              1) Decision trees with piecewise linear models with kriging of residuals developed from soil site data \n\n              across Australia. (Viscarra Rossel et al., 2014a);\n\n              2) Disaggregation of existing polygon soil mapping using DSMART (Odgers et al. 2014a).\n\n              \n\n              Version 1 of the National Digital Soil Property Maps combines mapping from the:\n\n              \n\n              1) Australia-wide three-dimensional Digital Soil Property Maps;\n\n              2) Western Australia Polygon Disaggregation Maps;\n\n              3) South Australian Agricultural Areas Polygon Disaggregation Maps;\n\n              4) Tasmanian State-wide DSM Maps.\n\n              \n\n              These individual mapping products are also available in the CSIRO Data Access Portal \n\n              (https://data.csiro.au).

It shows the number of business establishments per city (CLUE) block, classified by their CLUE industry (from ANZSIC) and small area allocation.\n\nA business establishment is defined as a \n•  Commercial occupant in a building \n•  Separate land use \n•  Any permanent presence of economic activity in accordance with standard Industry classification (ANZSIC).\nHence, if one organisation has its presence in several buildings in the CLUE area, each time it will be counted as a separate establishment. Consequently, the count of establishments presented in CLUE represents the number of locations, rather than 'enterprises'.\n\nFor more information about CLUE see <a href=\"http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/clue\">http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/clue</a> \n\nFor more information about the ANZSIC industry classification system see <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1292.0\">http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1292.0</a>",

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "\n\n\nThis dataset shows the modelled regional connectivity links for generalist species (birds and small mammals). Based local corridor values based on least cost paths through a local links dataset (see Barrett and Love 2012) at 2012. Categories indicate quality of regional connectivity between larger high value habitat patches. \nDataset has been re-categorised from  the original raster data source to eliminate \"no value\" cells and converted to a vector.\nRegional Linkage Value: This layer is derived from a two-step process. The first process is a “join the dots” links analysis using 550,000 paths between point pairs selected at random. Points were grouped in high value woodland habitat patches only. This least cost pathway analysis was then run through the local links paths, that is regional links were preferentially routed along paths that did not have a canopy gap of &gt;100m. High values indicate that more paths were found, i.e. more important for regional connectivity between high value habitat patches.\nconnectivityLinkageValue:\nRepresents the categorisation of the \"accumulated least cost pathway\" value for each linkage between habitat patches.  Least cost pathway indicates the a combination of habitat suitability of nodes along the path, and a the barriers to migration along that pathway.\nThe ACT connectivity mapping was undertaken by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A full study report has been produced, and is entitled Fine Scale Modelling of Fauna Habitat and Connectivity Values in the ACT Region. This study built upon an earlier report entitled the Ecological Connectivity for Climate Change in the ACT and surrounding region, commissioned by the ACT Government as part of Weathering the Change Action Plan 1. The report was undertaken by the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University (Manning et al 2010). It is recommended that both reports be consulted when use is being made of the connectivity mapping available. Reports can be downloaded from the EPSDD website at https://www.act.gov.au/environment/research-and-data/conservation-research-and-technical-reports (Technical reports 21 and 27).\nUpdates: This dataset is static. \nFit for purpose: 2012 temporal coverage. This dataset should be used as a modelled tool for aiding landuse, strategic town planning, and conservation planning in the ACT including revegetation targets and informing environmental impacts of infrastructure and building projects. Cell size 15x15m.\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from errors.",

    "description": "Along with other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT is moving toward national best practice in flood risk management. This is the most comprehensive review of Canberra’s catchments and their associated flood risk to date. A 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of occurring in any year. This means that if you experienced a 1% AEP flood last year, the chance of experiencing a similar flood this year is still 1%.It used to be known as 1 in 100 year flood, but this term is misleading as it suggests such a flood will only occur once every 100 years.\n\n\nSee more about riverine flooding in the Australian Capital Territory - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps.\n\n\nSee some frequently asked questions and answers relating to flooding - https://www.environment.act.gov.au/water/riverine-flood-maps/flood-risk-and-flood-map-information.\n\n\n\n\nFloodplain data on this website:\n\n1.

Does not depict real-time information about a flood.\n\n5. Does not provide any information about other sources of flooding, including but not limited to flooding from overland flow, the bursting of pipes or overflows from a natural or artificial lake or dam.\n\n6. Does not represent historical flood events which have impacted the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n\nAccordingly,\n\n1.

Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data with the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) SA3 2016 dataset.\n\n\nSome data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.\n\n\nWhere data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.\n\n\nColumns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset includes all parking expiations issued by the Adelaide City Council, and includes data such as payments, current status and exemptions for all parking expiations issued during the last three years.\nThe dataset is refreshed on the 6th day of every month and includes data up to the end of the previous month. The data is re-written each month as statuses etc. do change for expiations issued during the period.  The data is valid as of the date the extract is run.\nFAQs\nWhy is the amount paid greater than the Expiation Amount?\nThe expiation amount is the amount of the original Expiation Fee on the date the Expiation Fee is issued.  After this time additional fees such as Reminder Fees, Search Fees and some others can be incurred which are added to the Expiation. \nAll Expiation Fees, Reminder Fees, Search Fees etc. are set by the State Government.\nWhat is FERU?\nFERU is the Fines Enforcement and Recovery Unit, who are responsible for the recovery and enforcement of unpaid Expiations.  If an Expiation Remains unpaid Council will refer the matter to FERU to recover the debt.  Expiations can also be referred to FERU when a payment plan is entered into.\nWhen an Expiation has been referred to FERU the Offence Balance in the data is $0.\nWhy is the Offence Balance a negative figure?\nOn some occasions Adelaide City Council receives payments (either one or multiple payments) in excess of the amount payable for an Expiation. Council has a procedure in place to identify these payments and try to return the money.",

It was created as part of an initiative to innovatively monitor coastal dune erosion and visualize these changes over time for future management and mitigation. This data includes Orthomosaic, DSM, DTM, Elevation Contours, 3D Mesh, 3D Point Cloud and LiDAR constructed from over 500 images captured from UAV (drone) and processed in Pix4D. All datasets can be freely accessed through DataWA.\nLink to Animated video fly-through of this 3D data model\nLink to the Sketchfab visualisation of the 3D textured mesh\nThe dataset is a Sparse 3D Point Cloud (i.e. a 3D set of points): the X,Y,Z position and colour information is stored for each point of the point cloud. This dataset is of the Floreat dog beach (2021 Flight-3 project area).",

    "title": "IMOS - ACORN - Phased array HF ocean radar system (WERA)",
    "description": "Coastal ocean surface radar is a land-based technique which uses scattering from the rough sea surface to obtain echoes which are Doppler shifted by the dynamics of the sea.  It has been shown (Crombie, 1955) that the scatter is predominantly a Bragg interaction between the radio wave and the sea surface gravity wave that is propagating in the same direction and with half the wavelength of the radio wave.  This Bragg interaction gives two strong first-order lines in the echo spectrum; one from the resonant gravity wave moving radially away from the station, and one from the resonant gravity wave moving towards the station.\n\nPhased array systems determine the azimuthal angle between the station and a point on the sea surface by forming a narrow beam; the range to the point is set by the propagation delay for the electromagnetic wave.  For the phased array systems, the two radar stations each operate for alternating periods of 5 minutes on and 5 minutes off, and out of phase, so that they can use the same frequency without interfering with each other.  During each 5 minute of operation the radar measures the component of the surface current at each point projected onto the radial from the station to the point.  \n\nAt the end of 10 minutes, the radial components of surface currents can be combined from the two stations to find the vector at each position on the grid.  While surface currents are generally the data of most interest, the phased array systems can also produce significant wave heights and wind directions at each grid point and a calculation of the full directional wave spectrum at ranges of up to about half the maximum range (which is 150 km).\n\nWERA HF ocean radar systems are used in the Capricorn Bunker Group (Tannum Sands and Lady Elliot Island), Queensland, at South Australian Gulf (Cape Spencer and Cape Wiles), South Australia, for Rottnest Shelf (Fremantle and Guilderton), Western Australia, and at Coffs Harbour (Red Rock and North Nambucca), New South Wales.",

    "description": "There are presence absence records for vegetation and matched hydrological data from 687 1 x 1 m quadrats recorded from 11 wetlands and wetland complexes (28 sampled hydrological gradients (referred to as transects) across the upper and lower southeast of South Australia. Plant data were collected in spring 2013. Hydrological monitoring data at each site consisted of continuous (6 hourly) surface water level data from a state agency monitoring network. Observed water levels at the monitoring instrument on the day of monitoring were related to the observed depth of water at each quadrat, assuming a flat, level water surface and obtain a datum for each quadrat relative to the monitoring instrument. The continuous monitoring record was then used to calculate a range of different hydrological predictors indicating the variation at each quadrat. The hydrological dataset provided are the univariate summary statistics recording different aspects of surface water dynamics for each quadrat. Hydrological predictors (sum-exceedance value, hydroperiod and maximum inundation depth) were calculated for annual and seasonal periods in the three-years prior to plant data collection. See metadata and relevant publication for additional details on calculation. Hydrological predictors for each quadrat are provided in a single matrix of sites by predictors, with relevant location details for the quadrat (xy coordinates, site, transect). Included is a single electrical conductivity class for each transect (ordinal variable - low moderate, high - see metadata). Vegetation data are provided as a single matrix (quadrats x plant functional group) showing presence absence of each functional group in each quadrat. There is also a lookup table giving the assignment of each plant species to a plant functional group.",

The data spans over the 2013/14 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) boundaries.\nJobs in Australia is a new release that provides aggregate statistics from the recently developed Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers.\nJobs in Australia describes all job relationships accumulated over the course of a year. This means that job counts in this publication are higher than the estimates of filled jobs published in the quarterly Australian Labour Account, which provides a point-in-time, or stock measure. These statistics about jobs also differ from Labour Force Survey statistics, which estimate the number of people who held a job in each month.\nThis data is Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data (catalogue number: 6160.0) used with permission from the ABS.\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThe purpose of this publication is to provide new information about the number and nature of filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. It includes information about multiple job-holding and employment in local areas. Jobs in Australia counts all jobs held during the reference year. This complements and expands on quarterly stock estimates of filled jobs presented in the Australian Labour Account.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

A ground examination revealed an order of radioactivity sufficient to warrant geological and radiometric surveys. A total of 1026 feet of costeaning was bulldozed. The increase of radioactivity with little depth and the satisfactory sample values justify exploratory drilling and possibly underground development, which will be started in 1953. The information available to date places the Brodribb deposit in an entirely different geological category from that of the Rum Jungle deposit. Even if the Brodribb deposit proves to be only of very low grade uranium, an entirely new and extensive province for uranium exploration will be opened.",

Most products involve putting together forecasts for the last 30 days to form an ensemble.\n\n\nModel Climatologies\nModel climatologies in same format as the forecasts and hindcasts. These can be used to creat forecast anomalies and therefore removing model biases. Each set starts on the first of the month. Note, for realtime forecasts starting on different days of the month, one should interpolate the two surrounding climatologies starting on the first of the month.\n\n\nForecast model output includes monthly means of global fields of upper ocean temperatures, currents, and salinity. Atmospheric fields include global fields of all surface fluxes (momentum, radiation, sensible and latent heat), and winds, temperatures, humidity, clouds, etc. \nA subset of daily data, suitable for driving offline mixed layer models and downscaled models, including surface fluxes, surface winds, surface currents and temperature, is also archived.",

Emissions are reported annually through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) platform, which is a requirement of Global Covenant of Mayors and C40 membership. \n\nEmission sources are broken down across the sectors: Stationary energy, Transportation and Waste. They are categorized by their \"scope\" which distinguishes between emissions that physically occur within the city (scope 1), from those that occur from the use of electricity and supplied by grids potentially crossing city boundaries (scope 2), from those that occur outside the city but are driven by activities taking place within the city’s boundaries (scope 3). All GHG emissions are presented in units of metric tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e).\n \nIn cases where there are limitations on data availability notation keys have been used. NO indicates that an activity or process does not occur or exist within the city. IE signifies GHG emissions for this activity are presented in another category of the inventory. NE is used when emissions occur but have not been estimated or reported due to unavailability of data.\n\nPreparing and reporting this data helps us to understand where the city's emissions come from. It allows us to plan our emission reduction activities to take effective action to mitigate climate change.",

    "description": "The Theme 5.3 study was undertaken to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns in seagrass composition, abundance and reproductive phenology in the Pilbara region. Key environmental parameters, especially light, that influence seagrass survival and can be altered by dredging were also characterised.\nFrom August 2013 to March 2015 (18 months), surveys of seagrass abundance were undertaken in the Exmouth Gulf region. The locations surveyed (South Muiron Island, Bundegi and Exmouth Gulf) encompassed a range in water clarity from clear to turbid. Less frequent surveys were undertaken at other locations in the Pilbara: Thevenard Island, Rosemary Island and Balla. Measurements of seagrass abundance were also obtained from monitoring conducted as part of the dredging and dredge-spoil management plan for Chevron Australia's Wheatstone Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project.\nDuring each survey measurements were made in the field, photographs were taken or samples were collected in order to measure the following variables:\n1.  percentage cover of seagrass and other benthos;\n2.  above- and below-ground biomass, shoot density, leaf length, leaf width and number of flowers;\n3.  density of seagrass seeds;\n4.  sediment grain size;\n5.  stable isotope ratios (Ô13C and Ô15N) of seagrass leaf tissue; and\n6.  water quality (light, conductivity, temperature, salinity, nutrients, suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who perform insufficient weekly physical activity. Insufficient physical activity is defined as those aged 18-64 years who did not complete over 150 minutes of physical activity, and at least 5 sessions over a week, and those aged 65+ years who did not complete 30 minutes of activity on at least 5 days in a week. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN107 should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates have a relative standard error of 25% to 50%.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations.The highest species abundance of foraminifera in core MD032607 was recorded by Globigerina bulloides (~45%) during the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6) and, generally, was the most abundant with an average abundance of 19.5%. The dominance of the sub-polar, transitional species, Ga. bulloides in this core suggests the influence of cold, nutrient-rich water during certain isotopic stages. Conversely, the dominant warm and oligotrophic species Globigerinoides ruber recorded its lowest abundance in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, and is totally removed from the record (0%) at 146K, 142K, and 139K yrs BP.",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2023 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2023 AIS data. This report - the 11th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

NSW Transport Theme  – Transport Services is part of the Transport Facility Point feature class. Features that make up the NSW Transport Theme  – Transport Services  include:Airports - An airport is a listed public or private known landing strip. This point feature dataset is part of the NSW Transport Theme.  Airport data points are positioned within the cadastral parcel in which they are located. Train Station - A place where passengers are exchanged between vehicles or between transport modes. This point feature dataset is part of the NSW Transport Theme. Railway station data points are positioned within the cadastral parcel in which they are located. Bus Interchange - A connection or terminal point for long distance bus travelers or other major transport interchange. This point feature dataset is part of the NSW Transport Theme.  Bus interchange data points are positioned within the cadastral parcel in which they are located Initial Publication Date05/02/2020Data Currency01/01/3000Data Update FrequencyDailyContent SourceData provider filesFile TypeESRI File Geodatabase (*.gdb)Attribution© State\n of New South Wales (Spatial Services, a business unit of the Department\n of Customer Service NSW).

A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.\nThe dataset contains: several csv files with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.\nThe transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including:\n\nSome cards are missing\nTranscripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information\nSome cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not\nSome of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card\nAs the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.\n\nIt is still a very valuable dataset as it contains a wealth of information about early settlers in Western Australia.

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The Landgate Perth Metro aerial mosaics cover approx. 9,400sqkm and in the summer, are typically captured over several days - weather permitting.\nHowever, flying the same extent in winter months poses many additional challenges including reduced number of flying hours (to avoid long shadows), and interruptions caused by cloud and the smoke from prescribed burns . This means this capture can extend to several weeks - sometimes even months. For these reasons, the use of a singular 'capture date' for metro captures as indicated in the SLIP index layers is potentially flawed and misleading and can be inaccurate.  \nWhen referenced to the aerial mosaic, this dataset can assist users in identifying the actual capture date over a specific area of interest - if required. It is a thematic record of the photo centres of each frame that are used in the creation of the mosaic and provides an indication (within approx 100m) of the capture date.",

These included Gourdon Bay, Quondong - Coulomb Point, Perpendicular Head and Packer Island. The marine benthic communities at these prospective sites are largely undescribed. On behalf of the Northern Development Taskforce (NDT), the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DECWA) has approached CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) to undertake a joint benthic community survey of four locations in this region.\n\nThis survey data will compliment the limited existing data and will used by NDT to rank and select suitable sites to be included in a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SAE). This selection process will be used to identify a suitable hub site that will minimise the degree of habitat disturbance by avoiding areas of high biodiversity and significance for threatened species and high productivity and structural complexity that may contain complex marine habitats, endemic species and important wildlife.",

The data spans over the 2013-14 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 SA2 boundaries.\nJobs in Australia provide aggregate statistics and are sourced from the Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. An 'employee Job' refers to a job for which the occupant receives remuneration in wages, salary, payment in kind, or piece rates. This excludes self-employment jobs held by Owner-Managers of Unincorporated Enterprises (OMUE).\nThe job counts in this release differ from the filled job estimates from other sources such as the Australian Labour Account and the Labour Force Australia. The Jobs in Australia release provides insights into all jobs held throughout the year, while the Labour Account data provides the number of filled jobs at a point-in-time each quarter (and annually for the financial year reference period), and Labour Force Survey data measures the number of people employed each month. \nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThis release provides statistics on the number and nature of jobs, the people who hold them, and their employers. These statistics can be used to understand regional labour markets or to identify the impact of major changes in local communities. The release also provides new insights into the number of jobs people hold, the duration of jobs, and the industries and employment income of concurrent jobs.\nThe scope of these data includes individuals who submitted an individual tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), individuals who had a Pay As You Go (PAYG) payment summary issued by an employer and their employers.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

The ADVs were each synchronized with a co-located temperature sensor, permitting the calculation of turbulent heat fluxes in addition to a multitude of other turbulent properties.\n\nVertical extent was between 390 metres and 420 metres below Mean Sea Level.",

The echosounder's nominal frequency is 12 kHz. \n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. \n\nThere are 53 files totalling 3.89 GB of raw data and 53 files totalling  9.61 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

Each restriction consists of a set of columns:\n\n<b>How the data joins:</b>\nThere are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions. \nThe way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don’t currently join.\n\n<b>Field information:</b>\n- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)\n- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive. (1-5=Monday to Friday)\n- StartTime: The time each day when the restriction applies.\n- EndTime: The time each day when the restriction ends.\n- TypeDesc: The type of restriction. Eg: \"2P Meter\" (two hour parking, paid for using a meter), \"Disabled Only\" (only vehicles with disabiled permits can park).\n- Description: A compact, human-readable description of the overall restrictions. TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces\n- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).\n- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\n\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times. Each restriction is a set of columns with a number: FromDay1, ToDay1, StartTime1, EndTime1, etc.\n\n<b>Disclaimer:</b>\nWhile all due care has been taken to ensure the data of this website is accurate, current and available please note: \n·         there may be errors or omission in it\n·         there may be occasions where the data is not available and/or the website will be unavailable. \n\nThe City of Melbourne and its employees accept no responsibility for any loss, damage, claim, expense, cost or liability whatsoever (including in contract, tort including negligence, pursuant to statue and otherwise) arising in respect of or in connection with accessing, using or reliance upon the data in this website, or the unavailability of the data or the website.",
