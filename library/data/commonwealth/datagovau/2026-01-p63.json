    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who perform insufficient weekly physical activity. Insufficient physical activity is defined as those aged 18-64 years who did not complete over 150 minutes of physical activity, and at least 5 sessions over a week, and those aged 65+ years who did not complete 30 minutes of activity on at least 5 days in a week. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN107 should be interpreted with caution, as the estimates have a relative standard error of 25% to 50%.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "The advent of deep-sea drilling in the 1950's prompted the use of planktonic foraminifera (unicellular protozans) as palaeoceanographic indicators. They provide a natural archive of past environmental changes due to their global distribution, their prolific productivity and sensitivity to environmental variations.The highest species abundance of foraminifera in core MD032607 was recorded by Globigerina bulloides (~45%) during the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6) and, generally, was the most abundant with an average abundance of 19.5%. The dominance of the sub-polar, transitional species, Ga. bulloides in this core suggests the influence of cold, nutrient-rich water during certain isotopic stages. Conversely, the dominant warm and oligotrophic species Globigerinoides ruber recorded its lowest abundance in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, and is totally removed from the record (0%) at 146K, 142K, and 139K yrs BP.",

    "description": "_This dataset is updated weekly. Please ensure that you use the most up-to-date version._\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) is Australia’s national regulator of charities.\r\nSince 3 December 2012, charities wanting to access Commonwealth charity tax concessions (and other benefits) need to register with the ACNC. Although many charities choose to register, registration with the ACNC is voluntary.\r\n\r\nEach year, registered charities are required to lodge an Annual Information Statement (AIS) with the ACNC. Charities are required to submit their AIS within six months of the end of their reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe AIS collects information about a charity’s programs, HR and financial information.\r\n\r\n##AIS data\r\nThis dataset can be used to find 2023 AIS information lodged by multiple charities.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used to filter and sort by different variables across all AIS information. AIS Information for individual charities can be viewed via the [ACNC Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/).\r\n\r\nOur explanatory notes (see below) detail the information collected in the AIS and the data outputs you can expect.\r\n\r\nThe ACNC has also published a report analysing 2023 AIS data. This report - the 11th edition of the Charities Report - can be found on our website.\r\n\r\n##Interpreting AIS data\r\nWhen comparing charities’ financial information it is important to consider each charity's unique situation. This is particularly true for small charities, which are not compelled to provide financial reports – reports that often contain more details about their financial position and activities – as part of their AIS. For more information on interpreting financial information, please refer to the [ACNC website](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/about-acnc-charity-register/information-charity-register).\r\n\r\n##Withheld information\r\nRegistered charities can apply to the ACNC to have some or all of the information they provide withheld from the ACNC Register. However, there are only limited circumstances when the ACNC can agree to withhold information. If a charity has applied to have their data withheld, the AIS data relating to that charity has been excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is possible that some information in this dataset might be subject to a future request from a charity to have their information withheld. If this occurs, this information will still appear in the dataset until the next update. Please consider this risk when using this dataset.\r\n\r\n##More ACNC data\r\nThe ACNC also publishes other datasets on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/organisations/org-dga-4d907503-b2aa-4c38-ac13-1273e791cb08) as part of our commitment to open data and transparent regulation.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The Landgate Perth Metro aerial mosaics cover approx. 9,400sqkm and in the summer, are typically captured over several days - weather permitting.\nHowever, flying the same extent in winter months poses many additional challenges including reduced number of flying hours (to avoid long shadows), and interruptions caused by cloud and the smoke from prescribed burns . This means this capture can extend to several weeks - sometimes even months. For these reasons, the use of a singular 'capture date' for metro captures as indicated in the SLIP index layers is potentially flawed and misleading and can be inaccurate.  \nWhen referenced to the aerial mosaic, this dataset can assist users in identifying the actual capture date over a specific area of interest - if required. It is a thematic record of the photo centres of each frame that are used in the creation of the mosaic and provides an indication (within approx 100m) of the capture date.",

The data spans over the 2013-14 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 SA2 boundaries.\nJobs in Australia provide aggregate statistics and are sourced from the Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. An 'employee Job' refers to a job for which the occupant receives remuneration in wages, salary, payment in kind, or piece rates. This excludes self-employment jobs held by Owner-Managers of Unincorporated Enterprises (OMUE).\nThe job counts in this release differ from the filled job estimates from other sources such as the Australian Labour Account and the Labour Force Australia. The Jobs in Australia release provides insights into all jobs held throughout the year, while the Labour Account data provides the number of filled jobs at a point-in-time each quarter (and annually for the financial year reference period), and Labour Force Survey data measures the number of people employed each month. \nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThis release provides statistics on the number and nature of jobs, the people who hold them, and their employers. These statistics can be used to understand regional labour markets or to identify the impact of major changes in local communities. The release also provides new insights into the number of jobs people hold, the duration of jobs, and the industries and employment income of concurrent jobs.\nThe scope of these data includes individuals who submitted an individual tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), individuals who had a Pay As You Go (PAYG) payment summary issued by an employer and their employers.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

Counts are of rented occupied private dwellings (excludes caravans etc in caravan parks and not classifiable households(a)), based on place of enumeration on census night which; includes overseas visitors; excludes Australians overseas; and excludes adjustment for under-enumeration. The data is by LGA 1991 boundaries. Periodicity: 5-Yearly. \nThis data is ABS data (cat. no. 2101.0 &amp; original geographic boundary cat. no. 1261.0.30.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The tabular data was processed and supplied to AURIN by the Australian Data Archives. The cleaned, high resolution 1991 geographic boundaries are available from data.gov.au.\nFor more information please refer to the 1991 Census Dictionary.\nPlease note:\n\n\n(a) Not classifiable households are those dwellings which were temporarily unoccupied at the time of the census, but thecollector had ascertained that it was normally occupied, or the household contained only persons aged under 15 years.\n\n\n(b) Comprises households where at least one, but not all, member(s) aged 15 years or more did not state an incomeand/or at least one spouse, offspring, or co-tenant was temporarily absent.\n\n\n(c) Comprises households where no members present stated an income.\n\n",

Each restriction consists of a set of columns:\n\n<b>How the data joins:</b>\nThere are three datasets that make up the live parking sensor release. They are the on-street parking bay sensors, on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions. \nThe way the datasets join is as follows. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute. The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street car park bay restrictions by the bay_id attribute. The on-street parking bays and the on-street car park bay restrictions don’t currently join.\n\n<b>Field information:</b>\n- FromDay: The first day in the range on which this restriction applies (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)\n- ToDay: The final day in the range, inclusive. (1-5=Monday to Friday)\n- StartTime: The time each day when the restriction applies.\n- EndTime: The time each day when the restriction ends.\n- TypeDesc: The type of restriction. Eg: \"2P Meter\" (two hour parking, paid for using a meter), \"Disabled Only\" (only vehicles with disabiled permits can park).\n- Description: A compact, human-readable description of the overall restrictions. TKT A stands for Ticket Area covers multiple bays within that area. DIS ONLY and DIS are both disabled parking spaces\n- Duration: The time that a vehicle can park in the spot (assuming they can legally park there).\n- DisabilityExt: For bays that aren't limited to disabled permits, how much time a vehicle with disabled permit can spend in the spot. Usually twice the regular amount of time.\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\n\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times. Each restriction is a set of columns with a number: FromDay1, ToDay1, StartTime1, EndTime1, etc.\n\n<b>Disclaimer:</b>\nWhile all due care has been taken to ensure the data of this website is accurate, current and available please note: \n·         there may be errors or omission in it\n·         there may be occasions where the data is not available and/or the website will be unavailable. \n\nThe City of Melbourne and its employees accept no responsibility for any loss, damage, claim, expense, cost or liability whatsoever (including in contract, tort including negligence, pursuant to statue and otherwise) arising in respect of or in connection with accessing, using or reliance upon the data in this website, or the unavailability of the data or the website.",
