The Australian Government ICT Trends Report 2014–15 (the Report) informs the general community and industry about Government ICT use and expenditure.\r\nAll Non-Corporate Commonwealth agencies participate in the annual ICT benchmarking exercise. Agencies provide data about their ICT costs, personnel and infrastructure. The Department of Finance (Finance) uses the data to assess the whole-of-Australian-Government ICT environment. \r\nThe Report provides aggregate figures on:\r\n•\ttotal ICT expenditure, breakdowns of expenditure by service tower, and by cost element;\r\n•\tICT personnel, including by service tower, whether internal or external, and by level; and\r\n•\tICT infrastructure deployed by agencies, including numbers of servers and desktop devices.\r\n\r\nThe report is also available at http://www.finance.gov.au/governance-awards-data/ict-benchmarking/\r\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in July and August 2010 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS062010.\n\nDeparted:  Fremantle Australia, July 29, 2010\nArrived:  \t Fremantle, Australia, August 9, 2010\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This data release consists of flux tower measurements of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer in semi-arid eucalypt woodland using eddy covariance techniques. It been processed using PyFluxPro (v3.3.0) as described in Isaac et al. (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2903-2017</a>. PyFluxPro takes data recorded at the flux tower and process this data to a final, gap-filled product with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER). For more information about the processing levels, see <a href=\"https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki\">https://github.com/OzFlux/PyFluxPro/wiki</a>.\n\nThe Great Western Woodlands (GWW) comprise a 16 million hectare mosaic of temperate woodland, shrubland and mallee vegetation in south-west Western Australia. The region has remained relatively intact since European settlement, owing to the variable rainfall and lack of readily accessible groundwater. The woodland component is globally unique in that nowhere else do woodlands occur at as little as 220 mm mean annual rainfall. Further, other temperate woodlands around the world have typically become highly fragmented and degraded through agricultural use. The Great Western Woodlands Site was established in 2012 in the Credo Conservation Reserve. The site is in semi-arid woodland and was operated as a pastoral lease from 1907 to 2007.  The core 1 ha plot is characterised by <em>Eucalyptus salmonophloia</em> (salmon gum), with <em>Eucalyptus salubris</em> and <em>Eucalyptus clelandii</em> dominating other research plots.  The flux station is located in Salmon gum woodland. For additional site information, see https://www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes/great-western-woodlands-supersite/ . ",

    "description": "The area tested by drilling comprises approximately 30 acres of the Parish of Cullen Bullen in the County of Roxburgh, and is immediately to the east of the Portland-Mudgee railway line about 1.5 miles northward from Cullen Bullen Station. The purpose of drilling was to test the Irondale and Lithgow seams of the Upper Coal-Measures for thickness and quality, and thus determine whether or not the more detailed investigation of proving is warranted. Seven holes, with an average depth of 116 feet, were drilled by Goldfields Diamond Drilling Co. under contract to the bureau of near sites chosen by the Geological Survey of N.S.W. The total footage drilled was 810 feet and coal-core recovery averaged 89%. Core drilling in the Tyldesley Area has indicated the presence of 41,000 tons of banded high-ash coal in the lower split of the Lithgow Seam. The coal is considered unsuitable for exploitation by open cut methods and a proving campaign is not recommended.",

The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of mothers who smoked during pregnancy, and the denominator as the total number of mothers with a stated smoking status.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid.\n\n\nA woman's smoking status during pregnancy is self-reported.\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the number of mothers with a stated smoking  status for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nRelative Yield From Acidity (%) dataset is one of 11 national surfaces,\nrepresented by ~1km grids, relating to economic opportunities associated with\nsoil condition. All dollar values are given in 1996/97 Australian dollars.\nThere are three sub-types of data in this dataset: relative yields, gross\nbenefits and impact costs. Each is described as follows:1. Relative yield\n(RY): This is the yield of the crop or pasture, relative to its full potential\nexpressed as a percentage. It is equal to actual yield divided by potential\nyield. The relative yield surfaces, measured as a ratio (0 to 1) and\nrepresented with a 1km grid, include: * ry_salt2000; ry_salt2020: The relative\nyield of salinity in the year 2000 and 2020* ry_Acid; ry_Esp: The relative\nyield from soil acidity and soil sodicity* ry_min: The limiting factor\nrelative yield a minimum of ry_salt2000, ry_acid, ry_esp and ry_min.*\nlim_fact:Factor most limiting yield a of acidity, sodicity and salinity 2.\nGross benefit (GB): The gross benefit is the additional profit at full equity\nattainable through agricultural production if the yield-limiting factor of\nsalinity, acidity or sodicity were repaired without cost. As such it can be\nconsidered an approximate investment ceiling on treating the soil. The gross\nbenefit grids are measured in $/ha/yr and include:* gb97a; gb97e; gb97s a for\nsoil acidity; sodicity; salinity* gb97m a the combined limiting factor gross\nbenefit. 3. Impact cost (ic97s): This is the decline in agricultural profit at\nfull equity due to worsening dryland salinity severity and extent over the\ntime period 2000 to 2020. It is measured in $/ha/yr. It is determined only\nthrough changes in crop yield as a consequence of changes in dryland salinity.\nImpact cost can be considered the loss in profit at full equity due to\nworsening salinity over the 20yr time period. Keywords: Economics, Natural\nResources, Australia, Salinity, Sodicity, Acidity, Soil TreatmentData is in\nalbers and unprojected, using WGS84 and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_easc_r9cl\n__08312a07.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "The <strong>Climate Vulnerability Assessment</strong> was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Methodology Report</a> which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\n\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: <em>Horticulture and Viticulture</em>, <em>Broadacre Cropping</em>, <em>Forestry</em>, <em>Extensive Livestock</em>, <em>Marine Fisheries</em>, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment/publications-and-reports\">Summary Report</a> gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\n\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/climate-vulnerability-assessment\">project's web pages</a> to access these reports and for further information.\n\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the <strong>dryland canola</strong> model in the Broadacre Cropping node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally high magnetic fields. From the 30 known magnetars, only six have had radio emission detected so far. The remaining 24 magnetars are generally only searched for radio emission after an X-ray outburst. This added a strong selection bias to whether magnetars are radio loud or not. From the known six radio loud magnetars, we know that the radio emission changes quickly with time and for the magnetar XTE J1810-197, it has been observed that the radio flux increases strongly without an enhancement in X-ray flux. Thus, it remains unclear whether the radio quiet magnetars are in fact radio quiet and the radio X-ray relation appears to be rather complex.\n  In this proposal, we propose a regular monitoring campaign of 4 radio quiet magnetars with bi-weekly observations using the Parkes UWL receiver. For 3 of the sources, we will have accompanying X-ray observations and thus, this will give an unique data set to probe the relation between radio and X-ray independent outbursts. Any detection of radio emission, i.e. single pulses or folded profiles, would be a major discovery and help to constrain the emission mechanisms of magnetars. This will also help to improve the understanding of the emission mechanism of fast radio bursts. However, also a non-detection of radio emission will provide upper limits that serve as a baseline before any future outburst of the observed magnetars as well as allow to constrain the formation process of magnetars in contrast to pulsars.",

    "description": "During 1951 three separate sets of La Cour pattern Quartz Horizontal Magnetometers were received from the Danish Meteorological Institute. These instruments which are only semi-absolute, were calibrated at the Rude Skov Magnetic Observatory against the standard adopted by that observatory. As the Australian observatories are based on the International Magnetic Standard housed at Cheltenham near Washington, U.S.A. (hereinafter referred to as I.M.S.) it was decided to compare them against the Toolangi magnetometer as soon as possible after their arrival in Australia. Moreover, as the stability of these instruments depends on the torsion properties of a quartz fibre and on the magnetic moment of a magnet, regular comparisons should be made with an absolute magnetometer and the results used to control drift that might occur. The comparisons made immediately after the arrival of the instruments in Australia would thus constitute a starting point in the future control of the Q.H.Ms. [An account is given of work done between 1951 and 1952. Results are appended.]",

    "title": "Intertidal Marine Vegetation Strategies (IMVS)",
    "description": "The Intertidal Marine Vegetation Strategies (IMVS) are products of the NSW Marine Estate Management Strategy (MEMS). The separate reports and data packages cover the floodplains of NSW estuaries. The first IMVS covers the Tweed River estuary, and as IMVS for other estuaries and marine parks are released, the datasets will be added to SEED. The IMVS, supporting documents and geodata packages are centralised information sources to aid management of saltmarsh and mangrove habitats in NSW now and into the future.\n\nMapping of high macrophyte potential and identification of intertidal marine vegetation ‘hotspots’ where management actions may be meaningfully undertaken applies the methods outlined in the Marine Vegetation Management Strategies: a framework for estuary wide prioritization of protection and rehabilitation. This publication outlines the theoretical processes behind the applied prioritisation approach and provides comprehensive detail and justification on the study approach and methods used. \n\nEach estuary or marine park specific IMVS identifies macrophyte potential hotspots where a tailored suite of management actions has been developed to increase the resilience of intertidal marine vegetation. Actions address key threats and risks to saltmarsh and mangrove communities to safeguard the ongoing provision of ecosystem services and environmental, social, cultural, and economic values in response to sea level rise and other impacts. Importantly, a landholders’ right to carry out agricultural or developmental activities on their land is not altered by their properties being identified in any IMVS documents and any involvement in delivering recommended management actions is entirely voluntary.\n\nThe IMVS includes information on recommended management actions categorised under Hydrology, Sediments, Vegetation and People and Planning approaches. More detailed information on the objectives and suitability of these management approaches can be found in the following documents:\n\nIMVS: Key approaches to Mitigate Risk and Support Adaptation \n\nIMVS: Integrated Landscape and Seascape Conservation\n\nIMVS: Weed Management Guide.\n\nNote that the recommendations are based on site-specific conditions and available information at the time of writing. As both environmental and anthropogenic conditions are dynamic, appropriate management strategies may be subject to change and current site assessments are required. Initiating changes to protect or restore hydrology or sedimentation may be complex and have unanticipated environmental, social, cultural and economic outcomes. When recommended projects are planned, expert assessment and a scrutiny of proposed actions by relevant authorities is still warranted as works may result in changes to the key ecological drivers of intertidal wetlands.\n\nImplementation of recommended actions must comply with regulatory requirements. Proposal assessments must be undertaken on a case-by-case basis as the approval pathway is not the same for every relevant Local Environmental Plan or SEPP. The planning approval pathway also depends on how a proposal is classified, the specific works to be undertaken, the location and land zoning, and whether the proponent is a public authority or private entity. There may also be other regulatory approvals that apply. Given the complexities of jurisdiction and classifications of works it is important to seek and retain written planning advice (for example, from a town planner and relevant approval authorities) during the planning stage so that environmental protection actions can be demonstrated as being compliant with current legislation and policy.\n\nThe geodata packages include information on high macrophyte potential, identified hotspots, recommended management actions (under Hydrology; Sediments; Vegetation; and People and Planning approaches), current mapped intertidal macrophytes, and projected intertidal vegetation with 0.5m and 1.5 m sea level rise.  Links to relevant resources are also provided.\n\nThe IMVS datasets for the following study areas can be accessed in the Related Datasets section below.",

The only changes made to the data were to move eight grid points to line up with the orthophotography.  For these edited points, the ‘x’ and ‘y’ fields were updated using the Field Calculator in Quantum GIS.  Attributes include; road name, fence name, type of infrastructure and x and y coordinates.\nAccuracy is high as the layer was based on the 2011 orthophotography.\nDisclaimer",

    "title": "Native Bees Remnant Patches",
    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "title": "Pest animal and Weed Management Survey: National landholder survey results",
    "description": "Overview  \r\n Established pests and weeds represent a high ongoing cost to Australian agriculture. The Australian Government has invested $50 million through the Australian Competitiveness White Paper to improve the way pest animals and weeds are managed and to increase the capacity of farmers to deal with these threats. This is through investment in projects that: develop new and improved control tools and technologies; improve land manager awareness and access to control tools and technologies; improve land manager knowledge of best practice pest animal and weed management; and increase land manager and community participation in pest animal and weed management activities. \r\n\r\n To enable the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to evaluate outcomes of this investment, baseline data is required to provide a national overview of the status and management of established pest animals and weeds. Currently, there is insufficient data available to establish the baseline. Therefore a national survey of agricultural land managers was undertaken to collect data on pest animal and weed status, impacts and management actions at the property and local area levels. \r\n\r\n This report presents the results of responses from 6470 agricultural land managers, representing broadacre, dairy, horticulture and other livestock industries across all natural resource management regions in Australia. \r\n\r\n Key Issues  \r\n Nearly 80 per cent of respondents were actively managing a pest animal, and 85 per cent were actively managing weeds on their property in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Shooting and ground baiting continue to be widely used tools for vertebrate pest management. Herbicide is used by 90 per cent of landholders in the management of weeds and reported as effective by the vast majority. \r\n\r\n The majority of respondents reported that pest animal and weed control methods they were using were at least moderately effective. \r\n\r\n Agricultural businesses spend a significant amount on managing pest animals and weeds. An average of $19,620 was spent per agricultural business on undertaking pest animal and weed management activities. This include pest animal and weed management related expenditure on traps, baits, herbicides, pesticides/insecticides, fuel, fencing materials, and labour (including the cost of contractors) on the property in the last 12 months. \r\n• For those managing pest animals they spend an average of $7,023 per year (pest animals including feral, natives, insects and other pests (for example, parasites and mites)). \r\n• Agricultural businesses spend an average of $17,917 per year on weed management activities, this includes all activities undertaken as part of the businesses’ usual production cycle activities, for example spraying weeds before planting a crop. \r\n Pest animal and weed control activities took an average of 77 person days per agricultural business by owners/operators (including family members) and 39 person days by contractors, employees and other people (for example, volunteers) in the last 12 months. \r\n\r\n Nearly eight per cent of landholders were members of a pest animal or weed management group. The majority of the groups had developed a plan for coordinating management activities or collaborating with other stakeholders. \r\n\r\n A majority of land managers reported: new and improved control methods; access to information on control options and methods; more management activities by other land managers (private and public); and better access to biological controls as important actions that could improve pest animal and weed management.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for October 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record.

These areas have been underserved because of their high cost, difficult terrain and lower population densities.\r\n\r\nFor more information on PUMP go to https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/pump",

Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2013 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

The 333 kHz was set to passive for the duration due to an issue with the transducer. Active acquisition of the 18, 38, 70 120, and 200 kHz frequencies was sporadic throughout the voyage due to calibrations of other acoustic instruments. Dedicated acoustic interference tests were performed throughout the voyage with different frequencies on active or passive to assess the impact of other acoustic systems on the EK80 data. Details on these tests are contained within the EVERlog records. \nData are stored in .raw, .bot and *.idx format at CSIRO. There are 2428 files totalling 30.8 GB of raw data in this dataset.\nNo processing has been conducted on this data.\nAdditional information regarding this dataset is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for January 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital point coverage of glacial sediments, collected and identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each glacial sediment sample is represented as a point which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected on glacial moraine ridges and along raised beach ridges and shorelines represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on the landscape. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and  glaciation cycles within the Windmill Islands.",

    "description": "This layer provides the boundaries of the Groundwater Catchments of Victoria and is a product of the NWC funded Secure Allocations, Future Entitlement (SAFE) Project. The Groundwater Catchments (GC) have been developed to provide complete coverage of Victoria while considering the following:\n\n(1) Reflect aquifer systems and groundwater movement; and,\n\n(2) Align with physical (i.e. surface water) and administrative boundaries where appropriate.\n\nThe GCs are aligned within Victoria’s Groundwater Basins (GB). Boundaries that related directly or in-directly to the physical characteristics of groundwater resources included groundwater flow divides, surface water flow divides, topographic divides, and geological structural features that influence aquifer extent and groundwater flow direction.\n\nAdministrative boundaries directly linked to the management of groundwater resources include:\n\nThe Victorian State Boundary (Water Act (1989);\n\nWSPA: Water Supply Protection Area (formally declared under provisions of the Act);\n\nGMA: Groundwater Management Area (described and lodged as a plan with the Central Plan Office);\n\nRWC: Rural Water Corporation administration areas - Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water (GWMWater), Goulburn Murray Water (GMW), Lower Murray Water (LMW) and Southern Rural Water (SRW); and\n\nMDBA: Murray Darling Basin Authority (Federal Water Act (2007)).\n\nThe description of water resource management is often described in terms of surface water and groundwater.  In reality, the two resources are connected; however there are differing degrees of interconnection depending on the groundwater system and location within the surface water catchment. In preparing the Groundwater Catchments (GC), surface water catchments were directly considered. The key surface water boundaries considered are:\n\nVictorian Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDL) Catchment boundaries;\nBureau of Meteorology (2011) Surface Water Basins (Australian Hydrological Geospatial Framework, product suite v2 2011);\nVictorian Surface Water Basin Catchment (Australia’s River Basin, 1997); and,\nGeoscience Australia (500 sqkm) National Nested Catchment.",

    "description": "A study of the response of phytoplankton to rainfall in Sydney Harbour on 4th November 2004 is reported here. \n\nSydney Harbour is an important port and recreational region for the city of Sydney. Phytoplankton can be used as one of the indexes of water quality. The concentration of phytoplankton is influenced by the nutrients in the water and the amount of nutrients is thought to alter according to the urban and industrial wastes that drain from the city of Sydney.    \nThe amount of phytoplankton before and after rainfall at Pyrmont in Sydney Harbour was observed. The concentration of chlorophyll after a period of rainfall from the 15th October to the 4th November 2004, as measured from the surface to 7m deep, was almost 5 times as much as that as before the rain event. The maximum chlorophyll concentration observed by fluorometer was 27 [ug/litre].",

This ratio uses near infrared and shortwave infrared imagery to highlight areas of vegetation impacted by fire. Larger dNBR values generally indicate more severe fire damage whereas negative values may indicate regrowth following a fire. Image sources are either Sentinel 2 (S2) or Landsat 8 (LS8); image source and reference dates are indicated in lineage section of this record.",

Physical removal involves using hand tools, power tools or machinery to remove or change the structure of the vegetation. This usually involves removing or thinning shrubs and thinning and pruning trees. Debris created by physical removal may be piled and burnt, chipped on site or removed from the site. Physical removal is usually only undertaken in small areas, but may be undertaken more widely in areas such as pine plantations.",

    "description": "This dataset provides daily measured streamflows into the four (4) major harvesting catchment dams in megalitres (ML). The streamflow is a calculated value which represents the observed 24-hour accumulated streamflow into the dam; net of any evaporation losses or rainfall gains from the dam surface. The streamflow measurement process requires reservior level, reservior gains and dam outflow data. The reservior level and dam outflow data is collected using telemetry devices. The reserviour levels are validated by Melbourne Water field operators. The dam outflow accounts for all water releases, including for consumption and for environmental purposes . The data is recorded at 8am daily. This data can be used in long and short-term catchment streamflow analysis.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

The report focuses on the beef industries of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Australia. There are two objectives. The first is to assess the main drivers behind growth of beef exports from each country between 2000 and 2014. The second is to project the value of beef exports between 2014 and 2030 under scenarios reflecting hypothetical and actual changes to policies and operating environments. \r\n\r\n A bilateral trade decomposition model was designed to quantify the historical drivers of beef exports from Australia and its major competitors in South America, with the aim of drawing implications for projections of future bilateral trade flows. Projections are developed for the period from 2014 to 2030 that are indicative of the prospects for both regions to expand their exports under three policy scenarios. \r\n",

    "description": "This report provides a description of the CERF Marine Biodiversity Hub's survey of the Carnarvon Shelf, Western Australia, in August and September, 2008. The survey was a collaboration between the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Geoscience Australia (GA) aboard RV Solander, as part of the Hub's Surrogates Program. The purpose of field surveys in the Surrogates Program is to collect high-quality, accurately co-located data to enable the robust testing of a range of physical parameters as surrogates of patterns of benthic biodiversity in strategically selected, spatially discrete areas that are representative of much broader benthic environments. \n\nThe report describes the methods employed in the survey and the datasets collected. Additional processing of most of the physical data (wave and current measurements, multibeam sonar bathymetry and backscatter, sediment grab samples, acoustic sediment profiles) and biological data (towed underwater video and stills photography, bottom sediment samples, near-bottom plankton samples) collected is required before comparative analysis between the data sets can commence. However, a number of initial interpretations of the physical data have been made and examples of the types of biota encountered in the towed video and stills photography and initial interpretations of the benthic communities encountered, are provided. The survey was focussed on three strategically selected study areas on the southern Carnarvon Shelf at Mandu, Point Cloates and Gnaraloo. A small additional area was also examined near the Muiron Islands, in the mouth of Exmouth Gulf, at the end of the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of cancer mortality data in Australia for all cancers combined, and six selected cancers (female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma of the skin, and prostate cancer) with their respective ICD-10 codes. The data spans the years 2011 to 2015 and is aggregated to Statistical Area 3 (SA3) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe source of the mortality data is the Australia Cancer Database, the National Mortality Database and the National Death Index. Cause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are maintained by AIHW in the National Mortality Database.\nFor more information, please visit the data source: AIHW - Cancer incidence and mortality in Australia by small geographic areas.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nColorectal deaths presented are underestimates. For further information on complexities in the measurement of bowel cancer in Australia, refer to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\nWhere records are null, data was not publishable because of small numbers, confidentiality or other concerns about the quality of the data.\n\n",

The mooring is located at Latitude:-32, Longitude: 115.416.\n\nPhysical sampling will be undertaken at each of the reference stations on a monthly basis. The physical samples will be analysed for nutrients, plankton species, both visibly and genetically, and pCO2. Biological sampling will greatly improve Australia's capability to meet its obligations for ecosystem based management and allow many researchers the opportunity to investigate possible long term changes in ecology that are likely to be linked to climate variability and wide scale validation of remotely sensed (satellite) observations of plant biomass.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of live births that were of low birthweight from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers. The data spans every two years between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe Child and Maternal Health Indicators have been calculated from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database and Register of Births and National Perinatal Data Collection. This measure has been calculated with the numerator as the total number of low birthweight liveborn singleton babies from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers, and the denominator as the total number of live births from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Child and Maternal Health Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThis dataset uses the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of a low birthweight baby as weighing less than 2,500 grams.\n\n\nData at the area level exclude births to Australian non-residents and women who could not be allocated because their usual residence was not stated or was not valid.\n\n\nMultiple births and stillbirths have been excluded.\n\n\nPercentage for an area are suppressed for publication and marked as 'NP' if the total number of liveborn singleton babies for the area is less than 100.\n\n",

Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth.

The smallest size fraction (<100µm) dominates at all depths. There are small peaks in the coarser grained material at the bottom of the core which relate to pteropod layers in the sediment.",

Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

    "description": "Data Notes:\n\n\nData is derived from the National Schools Statistics Collection (NSSC), which is managed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \n\n\nEnrolments are full-time equivalent (FTE). For the purposes of reporting, only students in Year 11 and 12 may be part-time. Hence there is no difference between \"full-time\" and \"full-time equivalent\" enrolments for K-10 or ungraded in NSW government schools.                \n\n\nUngraded students are students who are not assigned to a particular grade. These students are often enrolled in support classes or schools for specific purposes (SSPs). From 2020, only support students in SSPs are recorded as ungraded.                               \n\n\nIf a school has a total FTE enrolment greater than 5 for all its grades, then the grade-level FTE data is published. \n\n\nIf a school has a total FTE enrolment equal to or less than 5, the grade-level FTE data is suppressed and only the school level FTE data is published. Where only one grade at a school had a value of &lt;=5, the ungraded cell has also been suppressed for privacy reasons. Where there are no ungraded students, the grade with the next lowest total is also suppressed.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nEducation Statistics and Measurement Unit, Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation.\n",

    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

The habitat types depicted in the dataset include Reef, Cobble, Seagrass and Sand. The data was collected through intensive field sampling from August 2007 to May 2008 by marine researchers at the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute. The use of underwater camera equipment, echo sounder data and a Differential GPS unit allowed for the extensive area to be surveyed. The dataset is intended to be used to fulfil coastal management objectives according to The Living Marine Resources Act 1995.",

    "description": "Hillslope water erosion hazard was digitally mapped as part of the DPIPWE Water for Profit Program to enhance identification of Enterprise Suitability by effectively incorporating a sustainability measure of vulnerable soils.  The mapping shows areas where a water erosion hazard might exist if sufficient groundcover is not maintained, which could lead to soil resource degradation through soil, organic matter and nutrient loss, resulting in sedimentation and contamination of drainage lines and waterways after significant rainfall and runoff events.  Assigned classes are; Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High and Extreme as classified ratings of a soil erosion.  The index was generated as an erodibility factor (K) as part of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), combining Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) inputs of the soil properties Coarse Fragments, Sand %, Silt %, Clay %, Organic Carbon %, Soil Permeability, and Soil Structure, with Slope and Slope-Length (from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model).  The mapping covers the entire state of Tasmania at 30m resolution.",

    "description": "These data sets include Salinity, Carbon, Alkalinity, Oxygen and Nutrients (Silicate, Ammonium, Nitrite/Nitrate, Phosphate) analysed from samples collected as part of the Integrated Marine Observing Systems (IMOS) National Mooring Network - National Reference Station (NRS) field sampling. \nNine Sites are included in the IMOS NRS field sampling stations. Maria Island (TAS), Kangaroo Island (SA), Esperance (WA), Rottnest Island (WA), Ningaloo (WA), Darwin (NT), Yongala (QLD), North Stradbroke Island (QLD) and Port Hacking 100 (NSW). \nSampling at these sites is conducted by several members of IMOS NRS Biogeochemical project. Sampling at the sites began between 29/9/2008 and 8/11/2010 and is currently ongoing for 7 sites. Sampling ceased at Ningaloo and Esperance (WA) sites in Aug/Sept 2013.\nSampling is conducted monthly (Esperance and Ningaloo were 3 monthly) from small vessels. Depths sampled range from surface to 105 metres depending on the site. Depths are usually sampled at 10 metre intervals. Details including information on station locations, depths sampled and sample types collected are shown in the PDF link below extracted from the IMOS NRS NATIONAL REFERENCE STATIONS BIOGEOCHEMICAL OPERATIONS - A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK, Version 2.2 July 2012. A link to the full handbook is also provided which includes full details of the sampling regime and analyses.\nHistorical data collected as part of CSIRO Coastal Monitoring program is available for three of the National Reference Station sites:\nMaria Island Coastal Station Data 1944-2008, Port Hacking 100m Coastal Station Data 1953-2010 and Rottnest Island Coastal Station Data 1951-2009.\nThe links to the metadata and access for these data is provided below.\nData storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Station metadata can be found through this resource. Data is available freely via the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au.",

    "description": "The 2019-20 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2019-20 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for OutcomeX in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2019-20 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__\r\nThe PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos. 1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2018-19 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2019-20 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2018-19\r\n* 2019-20\r\n* 2020-21\r\n* 2021-22\r\n* 2022-23\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture and Water Resources Portfolio\r\n* Attorney-General’s Portfolio\r\n* Communications and the Arts Portfolio\r\n* Defence Portfolio\r\n* Defence Portfolio (Department of Veterans’ Affairs)\r\n* Education and Training Portfolio\r\n* Environment and Energy Portfolio\r\n* Finance Portfolio\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio\r\n* Health Portfolio\r\n* Home Affairs Portfolio\r\n* Industry, Innovation and Science Portfolio\r\n* Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities Portfolio\r\n* Jobs and Small Business Portfolio\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio\r\n* Social Services Portfolio\r\n* Social Services Portfolio (Department of Human Services)\r\n* Treasury Portfolio\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nBudget Paper Tables: The list below shows the data tables from the Budget Papers which are available in Excel and CSV formats.\r\n\r\n* Overview Glossy - Appendix C - Major Initiatives\r\n* Overview Glossy - Appendix D - Major Savings\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 3 - Table 7 - Reconciliation of underlying cash balance estimates\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 4 - Table 1 - Australian Government general government receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 4 - Table 7 - Australian Government general government (cash) receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 4 - Table 9 - Reconciliation of 2018-19 general government (accrual) revenue\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 5 -  Table 3 - Estimates of expenses by function\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 10 - Table 1 - Australian Government general government sector receipts, payments, net Future Fund earning and underlying cash balance\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 10 - Table 3 - Government general government sector taxation receipts, non-taxation receipts and total receipts\r\n* Budget Paper 1 - Statement 10 - Table 4 - Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 1.1 - Agency Resourcing Table\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 1.2 - Special Appropriations Table (and summary)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 1.3 - Special Accounts Table (and summary)\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 2.2 - Staffing by Agency\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 3.1 - Departmental Expenses Table\r\n* Budget Paper 4 - Table 3.2 - Net Capital Investment Table",

This complements local counts undertaken by the Newcastle Cycleways Movement. The count is conducted by volunteers who record bike rider movements on a count sheet.",

    "description": "The workshop on 'Coastal Management in Northern Australia' was organised by the N.T. Branch of the Australian Marine Sciences Association and the North Australia Research Unit of The Australian National University. The workshop was held in conjunction with the 'Conference on Coasts and Tidal Wetlands of the Australian Monsoon Region', at the Museum of Arts and Science, Conacher Street, Bullocky Point, Darwin, NT between 4-11th November 1984. This record links to the proceedings of the workshop currently archived in the ANU institutional repository, Demetrius.\n*****\nCoastal zone management is primarily about conservation of resources. As an objective, conservation must be viewed not only as a way of retaining what we have but also for creating what we want. In the Northern Territory, coastal environments are for the most part still unspoilt and very often near to original, except in localised areas. There is, therefore, an opportunity not existing elsewhere in the tropical world, to assess what we wish to plan towards and to establish the infrastructure by which such plans can be achieved.",

    "description": "The atomic interstellar medium shows tiny-scale optical depth fluctuations on the scale of 0.1~10,000 AU, whose origin and nature are poorly understood. The existence of this Tiny-Scale Atomic Structure (TSAS) has significant implications, potentially calling into question our fundamental understanding of heating, cooling and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Yet observations remain sparse. This long-term project plans to search for temporal variations in HI absorption spectra seen against background pulsars to characterise TSAS in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). These observations constitute the largest number of sightlines and densest temporal sampling ever performed in a single experiment, and will test predictions that TSAS is the tail end of a turbulent cascade, constrain its minimum size scale (down to resolutions of ~0.05 AU) and potentially provide the first direct measurements of pressures in \"large\" TSAS features of &gt; 1000 AU. We make use of the phase-resolved spectral line mode that we have recently implemented on Parkes, which has cut data rates and processing times by factors of ~1000 compared to past studies. This is an expansion of our pilot P1321 to a long term study.",

    "description": "\nThe focus of this dataset is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It contains digital spatial data developed to assist in land management decision making in the ACT. The dataset contains hazard ratings for land salinity, stream salt load and stream EC as well as overall salinity hazard for each HGL unit. Information about landscape functions and appropriate salinity management strategies are also listed. Hyperlinks to full management descriptions for each HGL unit are provided. The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) concept provides a structure for understanding how differences in salinity are expressed across the landscape. A HGL spatially differentiates areas with similar salt stores and pathways for salt mobilisation. The process of delineating a HGL relies on the integration of a number of causative factors: geology, soils, slope, regolith thickness, and climate; an understanding of the different modes of salinity development; and the impacts of salinity within landscapes (land salinity, salt load and salt concentration in streams due to salt contributions from base flow and runoff ). Information sources such as soil landscape maps, site characterisation, salinity occurrence maps, hydrogeological data, surface water and groundwater data are incorporated into standardised unit descriptions.\nFit for purpose: This dataset was captured at 1:25,000 scale. This dataset is fit for use as a tool for assessing land management issues at the paddock-scale in the ACT, but this does not negate the need for site assessment at a scale suitable to any potential land use or development under consideration.  The mapping was mapped in 'GDA1994 MGA Zone 55s' and transformed to GDA2020 MGA Zone 55s.\nCredits: Rob Muller (NSW OEH), Wayne Cook (NSW OEH), Allan Nicholson (NSW DPI), Alie Cowood (UC)\nDisclaimer: While all care is taken to ensure accuracy, the ACT Government does not warrant that the map is free from error.",

    "description": "The City of Melbourne has installed in-ground parking bay sensors in most CBD parking bays. These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2011 calendar year\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1.There are 488,167 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time.\n\nDownload:\n\n<a href=\"https://opendatasoft-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/archive/vkxi-k7ps.zip\">Download</a> compressed CSV (592.8MB, 21.8 million rows)",

Counts are provided by species and IBRA region for:  \n\nThe number of records showing evidence of the species’ presence inside the region\nThe number of records showing evidence of the species’ presence within CAPAD 2020 protected areas inside the region\nThe number of records showing evidence of the species’ presence within the protected areas under indigenous management within the region  \n\nThe first count includes all records in the second count and the second count includes all records in the third count.\nThe counts in this dataset allow for some simple comparisons between the numbers of species recorded inside and outside protected areas in each region and comparison of the species in each region. Inclusion of EPBC statuses allows comparisons based on conservation status. Note however that such counts may not accurately reflect real differences in biodiversity. It is important to consider confounding factors (particularly variations in recording effort over time).  \nOccurrence records were aggregated and organised by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, https://ala.org.au/) and include survey and monitoring data collected and managed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, https://imos.org.au/) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN, https://tern.org.au/).  \nTo find out more about this dataset, visit: https://ecoassets.org.au/data/summary-data-protection-status-for-australian-terrestrial-species-occurrences/\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.26197/ala.445c74bb-89f2-415e-9e5b-0e38e9c7ee1e",
