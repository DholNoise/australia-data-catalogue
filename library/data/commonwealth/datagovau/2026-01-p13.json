    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Central Coast catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

The grids show the rainfall values across Australia in the form of two-dimensional array data. The mean data are based on the standard 30-year period 1961-1990.\n\n\n\nTo view the full metadata statement, you will need to download the dataset and view in the 'Description' tab in ArcCatalog.\n\n\n\nThis dataset has been provided to the BA Programme for use within the programme only. For copyright information go to http://www.bom.gov.au/other/copyright.shtml.   Information on how to request a copy of data can be found at www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nGridded data were generated using the ANU (Australian National University) 3-D Spline (surface fitting algorithm).\n\nThe resolution of the data is 0.025 degrees ( approximately 2.5km) - as part of the 3-D analysis process a 0.025 degree resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was used.\n\nApproximately 6000 stations were used in the analysis over Australia.  All input station data underwent a high degree of quality control before analysis, and conform to WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) standards for data quality.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBureau of Meteorology (2008) BOM, Australian Average Rainfall Data from 1961 to 1990.

    "description": "    \r\n\r\nThe data shows areas of dryland salinity risk in 2050 in the Murray-Darling\r\nBasin.Areas of risk are based on groundwater levels and air photo\r\ninterpretation. The merged data, at a nominal scale of 1:250 000, show actual\r\nareas where dryland salinity or water-tables less than 2 metres have been\r\nmeasured. For the extent map, every delineated area is underpinned by either\r\nair photo data or by one or more groundwater bores. Therefore, the area at\r\nrisk is regarded as conservative due to limitations in the spatial coverage of\r\nair photo and bore data.  number of techniques to spatially extrapolate these\r\ndata to infer potential areas at risk were trialed but were considered\r\nscientifically or statistically inadequate. Estimates of impacts are based on\r\nareas at risk having groundwater levels of less than 2 m. An impact assessment\r\nbased on groundwater less than 5 m and rising was considered inappropriate.\r\nTotal areas affected with groundwater less than 5 m and rising have been\r\npresented, but only for improved consistency with other States.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dsa__r1in\r\n__00111a03.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for June 1991. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

They are conducted on weekdays during both the morning and afternoon peaks as well as during the off-peak period. The results are displayed as actual travel speeds for each of the routes individually in a separate dataset \"Travel Speed in Metropolitan Adelaide \", as well as aggregated to form a suite of travel time performance indicators. The aggregation is done by breaking each route down into a series of 'links' and weighting travel times for each link by the average number of vehicles per hour travelling on that link. This dataset has results from 1994 to the latest year. ",

    "description": "This data set shows the average attendance rate for students in NSW government schools by Statistical Area 4 (SA4).\nData notes\n\n\n2021 data is not comparable to previous years due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to calculation rules to align with ACARA’s national standards (version 3) and changes to the way attendance data is transferred into the department’s centralised data warehouse. Please refer to 2021 Semester 1 student attendance factsheet for more information.\n\n\n2020 data is not provided because students were encouraged to learn from home for several weeks in Semester 1. Please refer to the factsheet on The effects of COVID-19 on attendance during Semester 1 2020 for more information.\n\n\nIn 2018 NSW government schools implemented the national standards for student attendance data reporting. This resulted in a fall in attendance rates for most schools due to the inclusion of part day absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation. Data from 2018 onwards is not comparable with earlier years.\n\n\nSchools for Specific Purposes (SSPs) are only included from 2021. Prior to this SSP attendance data was not collected centrally.\n\n\nThe attendance rate is defined as the number of actual full-time equivalent student days attended by full-time students in Years 1–10 as a percentage of the total number of possible student-days attended in Semester 1. Figures are aligned with the National Report on Schooling and the My School website.\n\n\nSA4 refers to the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 Statistical Area 4 (SA4) – 2021.\n\n\n‘Other Territories’ has been assigned to Norfolk Island Central School, which operated under the responsibility of NSW Department of Education between 2018-2021.\n\n\nData source\nSemester 1 Return of Absences Collection\nData quality statement\nThe Attendance Data Quality Statement addresses the quality of the Attendance dataset using the dimensions outlined in the NSW Department of Education's data quality management framework: institutional environment, relevance, timeliness, accuracy, coherence, interpretability and accessibility. It provides an overview of the dataset's quality and highlights any known data quality issues.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model.

The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

    "description": "This data was collected in February and March 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS032008.\n\nDeparted: \tPort Adelaide, South Australia, February 28, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, March 17, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) solar panel systems.The data spans the months from January 2020 to June 2021 and includes the total over the months from 2001 to 2019. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nA 12 month creation period for registered persons to create small-scale technology certificates applies under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Therefore the 2019 and 2020 figures will continue to rise due to the 12 month creation period.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). \n\n\nThis data is current as at 30-06-2021.\n\n\nFurther information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n AURIN has made the following change to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n",

    "description": "This Bio Acoustic data was collected in February/March 2012 under the IMOS Ship of Opportunity (SOOP) Bio Acoustic (BA) program on Sealord FV Will Watch (IMOS platform code: E5WW).\n\nDeparted:  Western Indian Ocean, February 28, 2012\nArrived:  \tWestern Indian Ocean, March 03, 2012\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

    "description": "This dataset contains information from the 'Physical health and wellbeing' domain of the Australian Early Development Censuses (AEDC) from 2009 - 2018. The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem (SA3 code 70203) and East Arnhem (SA3 code 70204) are combined in the original data. AURIN has assigned the results for these regions to the boundary of Daly - Tiwi - West Arnhem and excluded the boundary of East Arnhem from this dataset.\n\n",

Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2017 calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown data issues: \n\n\n\n1. There are 860 records that have the text ‘OLD’ at the end of the restriction in the field named ‘Sign’. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either: \n\n\n\n· At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (April 2018) the restriction had since changed. \n\n\n\n· (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \n\n\n\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field ‘seconds’. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \n\n\n\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \n\n\n\nData that is excluded: \n\n\n\nIn the 2017 car parking event data there are 3,858 records where the parking event goes into 2018 and ends at midnight.\nDownload:\nDownload compressed CSV (1.13GB, 35.9 million rows)",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of women having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of females having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section, divided by the number of females having their second birth whose first birth was by caesarean section and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nIncluded are those females who are having a singleton for their second birth and whose first birth was by caesarean section.\n\n\nExcluded are those females whose second birth is a multiple birth, those who are not having their second birth, and those who are having their second birth and whose first birth was a vaginal birth.\n\n\nData for Victoria in 2007 to 2009 were not available.\n\n\nData for WA in 2013 is not published as complete data due to only half a year being reported.\n\n\nFrom 2014, Caesarean section at most recent previous birth indicator data item was introduced into the Perinatal NMDS. Although not an NMDS/DSS item prior to 2014, data items appear to match the data element developed by NPDDC, Caesarean section indicator (last previous birth).\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "Improving water quality in the coastal zone is vital for sustaining the industries, communities and ecosystems dependent on coastal catchments. This project will provide national community benefits across several levels, including direct benefits to rural and regional communities. At the regional level, the project will inform policy makers and managers on how to balance environmental protection with competing development demands. At the national level, it will provide tools and a structured process for managers to assess water quality impacts in the coastal zone. It will be particularly useful for guiding protection and enhancement of coastal environments under pressure from urban development and land use intensification. \n\nThis project will apply and integrate water quality models and economic assessment techniques to assist policy makers and catchment managers balance competing development pressures and environmental concerns in coastal catchments. The research is fundamental to underpinning the sustainable management of coastal catchments which provide major economic, environmental and community benefits. The project will provide robust tools to predict water quality impacts under a range of conditions and it will develop techniques for the economic valuation of market and non-market impacts. The project will demonstrate the integration of water quality and economic modelling and how it can influence policy and investment in conservation and remediation.\n\nThe project is focused in the Eurobodalla Shire on the south coast of NSW, Australia.",

    "description": "Abstract from: 'An inventory of present glaciers on Heard Island and their historical variation' by Andrew Ruddell.\r\n\r\n      Heard Island is a large ice-covered volcanic cone situated in the south Indian Ocean. Its location enables unique climatic information to be obtained from a very remote and predominantly maritime region. Past studies show that while some glaciers have undergone major recession since the late 1940s, others, such as large non-calving glaciers, have shown little change in extent. The island is usually cloud covered and this has hampered aerial and ground based surveys. Using SPOT satellite imagery acquired in 1988 and supplemented by aerial photography in 1987 and a digital elevation model derived from 1997 Radarsat imagery, an inventory of glacier extent is provided and this indicates that there are a total of 29 glaciated basins (41 termini), with an area of 257 km2 and an estimated volume of 14.2 km3. The satellite imagery is used to rectify earlier estimates of glacier extent based on aerial photography in 1947 and 1980. Between 1947 and 1988 the glaciated area had decreased by 11% and volume by 12%. Approximately half of this occurred during the 1980s.\r\n\r\n      A variety of historical records have been compiled and these provide evidence of glacier behaviour since the mid-1800s when they were at their greatest extent during the recorded period. The elevation range of a glacier is a good indication of glacier hypsometry and its sensitivity to mass balance and climate variations. Glaciers such as the Gotley are of large elevation range and high mass turnover. Such glaciers show little sensitivity to climate variations as they lose much of their ice through calving into the sea rather than surface melt. Glaciers of low elevation range such as those on the Laurens Peninsula are especially sensitive to climate change. Glaciers of this type indicate that while minor decadal fluctuations have occurred in the period from at least 1902 to the 1950s, the recession of many glaciers during the past 50 years has been unprecedented. The glacier variations correlate with observed temperature records.\r\n\r\n      Observations of occasional volcanic eruptions since the 1880s indicate that most activity is related to lava flows from Mawson Peak and fumerole activity on its upper southwestern slope. This activity appears to have had little effect on the Gotley and Lied glaciers.",

    "description": "Vectorized version of the Land Monitor Salinity Extent – South West of Western Australia 2010 dataset.\n\nSalinity mapped in raster format with 25-m pixels. The Land Monitor salinity mapping process uses satellite imagery, high-resolution topographic data, ground information and ancillary GIS data sets to map areas of severely salt-affected land identified in consecutive satellite (Landsat TM) scenes (Furby et al 2010). To update the 1990 and 1998 estimates, the spatial-temporal methodology was re-applied using the same approach but took advantage of the latest data and improved computational resources (Caccetta et al 2022). Any changes in the extent of salt affected land detected by Land Monitor in the updated salinity mapping are most likely within the severe salinity class and may represent either expansions of this class of salinity or improvements in the condition of severely salt affected land or in the reduction of commission errors (compared to the original mapping).\n\nThis data has converted the salt effected areas to a vector geodatabase. Additional post processing to remove urban areas has been applied.",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the age-standardised percentage of adults who are obese. Adults were classified as obese if their Body Mass Index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 30. As an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using standard error estimates of the proportion. The data spans the financial year of 2014-2015 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nHealth risk factors are attributes, characteristics or exposures that increase the likelihood of a person developing a disease or health disorder. Examples of health risk factors include risky alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and high blood pressure. High-quality information on health risk factors is important in providing an evidence base to inform health policy, program and service delivery.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Health Risk Factors in 2014-2015 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nAge-standardisation is a method of removing the influence of age when comparing populations with different age structures - either different populations at the same time or the same population at different times. For this data the Australian estimated resident population of people aged 18 and over as at 30 June 2001 has been used as the standard population.\n\n\nAdults are defined as persons aged 18 years and over.\n\n\nValues assigned to \"n.p.\" in the original data have been removed from the data.\n\n\nData for PHN701 (Northern Territory) should be interpreted with caution as the National Health Survey excluded discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and very remote areas, which comprise around 28% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n",

    "description": "By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. This database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of geomorphic river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis is undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer of the Open Access NSW River Styles database that is available from DPIE (www.dpie.nsw.gov.au).  The River Styles database was accessed in January 2021. The database and associated workflow identifies reach and loci connections based on different combinations of recovery potential classes. Reach connections are defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and loci connections are defined as isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. This map for all freshwater stream length of the NSW Southern Rivers catchments, shows the spatial distribution of thirteen connections based on combinations and sequences of conservation, strategic and high recovery potential targets. Other connections of interest to river practitioners can be identified and &gt;80 different user-defined scenarios run using a workflow available at protocols.io.\nAttribution to: Macquarie University, D Agnew and K Fryirs (2022) Corridors of river recovery database and workflow.

    "description": "Resourcing Australia’s Prosperity is a 35-year initiative, led by Geoscience Australia, to enhance knowledge of Australia’s&nbsp;geology and groundwater systems.&nbsp;The groundwater project under the Initiative&nbsp;enhances understanding, management, and sustainable use of Australia’s groundwater by assessing groundwater systems, their connectivity and relationships with other natural resources across the continent. The groundwater project is taking national groundwater mapping to the next level and builds on foundational work under the recently completed Exploring for the Future Program.\n\nThe groundwater project comprises three key components. National 3D Groundwater Systems Mapping is enhancing National 3D geology models to incorporate hydrostratigraphy and build consistency in national groundwater databases through multi-agency collaboration. The National Hydrogeological Inventory provides a unified, multi-tier repository of hydrogeological data, ensuring consistency and accessibility for groundwater studies and management. The Groundwater Atlas&nbsp;integrates 3D models and hydrogeological data for priority regions, presented as a map compendium. The groundwater Atlas is designed to present groundwater conceptual models in a visually engaging manner for a broad audience.\n\nBy delivering these outcomes, the project strengthens Australia’s capacity to sustainably manage groundwater resources for current and future generations. It supports the clean energy transition by providing critical groundwater data, enhances national groundwater information access for government, industry, and communities, and improves data coverage and model confidence across state and territory jurisdictions. \n\nOngoing engagement with the Australian and International groundwater community will be critical to design and deliver groundwater products that meet the needs of all Australians.\n\nPresented at the 52nd Congress of International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH2025)",

    "description": "Advancing genetic solutions for crop protection in Australian wheat: identifying novel and optimal combinations of APR resistance genes to Septoria tritici blotch. \nWheat is one of the most important crops in Australia, providing food, feed and export income. However, wheat production is threatened by various diseases, such as Septoria tritici blotch (STB), a foliar disease of wheat caused by the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. This disease is prevalent in medium-high rainfall zones of Australia. If left unmanaged, STB can result in yield losses of up to 50% and traditional control by fungicides is estimated to cost the industry $121 million per year is less effective due to fungicide resistance evolving in Australia to some common triazoles and strobilurin.\nOne way to manage this disease is to use wheat varieties resistant to STB. However, 10 out of 17 genes tested for adult plant resistance (APR) performance in field experiments over the past 8 years are no longer effective in Australia. These include; Stb2/11/WW, Stb3, Stb4, Stb6, Stb7/12, Stb9 and Stb18. Therefore, identifying new sources of APR genes is essential for developing wheat varieties with better agronomic performance. \nAdult plant resistance (APR) genes confer partial but durable resistance to the disease at later stages of plant development. They are preferred in breeding programs because of their flexibility in integrated disease management (IDM) systems and their durability of resistance. These projects aim to discover and transfer novel APR genes for STB resistance into adapted wheat varieties while also determining the optimal combinations of existing effective APR genes and remove the barriers to their adoption by Australian wheat breeding programs. The resources available on this site are developed through research partnerships between GRDC and NSW DPI. There are resources provided on this page which are available to download as well as metadata for resources which have restricted access and will be made available only on request.",

    "description": "The Crater Prospect is situated about 4 miles south-south-east of White's workings and 1 mile north-east of the junction of Batchelor Road and the Darwin-Birdum railway line. It is the name assigned to a type area of an extensive radioactive bed of conglomerate. Low grade but wide-spread radioactivity was discovered by R.S. Matheson and D.F. Dyson (geophysicists) in June 1951, while prospecting along the sedimentary beds out-cropping immediately south of the Rum Jungle granite on the south-side of Giant's Reef fault, and on the south side of another major parallel fault. Geiger-Muller traverses along the strike of a grit-conglomerate horizon away from the Crater prospect revealed that the radioactivity extends westwards for 1.5 miles and for half a mile to the east. The radioactivity, which was confined to the conglomerate, was low-grade and discontinuous over this distance of 2 miles. The Crater Prospect, which can be regarded as a type locality, was geologically mapped by the writer on a scale of 200 feet to one inch after the area had been radiometrically contoured, and the plan accompanies this report (Plate 1). [The geology and structure of the prospect, nature of the radioactivity, and prospecting recommendations are discussed].",

    "description": "Magnetic fields are fundamental in regulating star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds. Zeeman splitting offers a unique method to directly measure line-of-sight magnetic field strengths in interstellar environments, from the diffuse ISM to dense cores. Observations of HI and OH absorption toward pulsars provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure magnetic fields with high precision, benefiting from pulsars' small angular sizes and reliable Stokes V spectra unaffected by instrumental effects. Our recent tentative Zeeman splitting detections in OH absorption toward PSR J1644-4559 with Parkes reveal magnetic field strengths that suggest magnetically subcritical states, where magnetic pressure counteracts gravity. This challenges conventional theories of subcritical cold neutral medium (CNM) transitioning to supercritical star-forming molecular clouds, emphasizing the need for detailed investigation. We propose a continuation of Zeeman splitting studies through high-sensitivity OH and HI absorption observations of pulsars PSR J1644-4559, J1721-3532, and J1852+0031 using Parkes. By employing an innovative phase-resolved spectral technique and extending integration times, we aim to enhance Zeeman detection sensitivity and study magnetic field transitions in the CNM and quiescent molecular clouds. This work will refine our understanding of subcritical-to-supercritical transitions in star formation, establish pulsar absorption as a robust probe of interstellar magnetic fields, and advance observational techniques critical to star formation studies.",

The age of the sediment at each sample depth was determined by correlating oxygen isotopes to the Martinson et al. (1987) age model. This information can then be used to infer sedimentation rates. The results indicate that core GC04 is characterised by slow sedimentation rates. The average sedimentation rate is 1.46cm/kyr.

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Bus Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2022",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

Applied, Approved and Under Construction, and Complete.\n\n\n\nSite content is derived from a range of sources at various times and as such the content may not be free from errors, omissions or defects. Inconsistencies may occur in some data sets. The City of Melbourne uses its best endeavours to ensure that the information is reliable.\n\n\n\nThe development polygons are representational only and are not intended for analytical or comparative purposes. The polygons are simplified polygons of an indicative floor plate for the podium (if relevant) and tower.

This is provided to help users understand the currency and reliability of the site content which often involves complex processes to derive the information. The aim is to provide users with facts about the source of the content and when it was collected. Users can then make an informed decision as to whether the site content is appropriate for their particular purpose and information needs.\n\n\n\nAlthough all due care has been taken to ensure that this data is correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by City of Melbourne in its use.\n\n\n\nPlease note we are aware of update issues and are currently investigating.",

    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "Magnetic fields are fundamental in regulating star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds. Zeeman splitting offers a unique method to directly measure line-of-sight magnetic field strengths in interstellar environments, from the diffuse ISM to dense cores. Observations of HI and OH absorption toward pulsars provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure magnetic fields with high precision, benefiting from pulsars' small angular sizes and reliable Stokes V spectra unaffected by instrumental effects. Our recent tentative Zeeman splitting detections in OH absorption toward PSR J1644-4559 with Parkes reveal magnetic field strengths that suggest magnetically subcritical states, where magnetic pressure counteracts gravity. This challenges conventional theories of subcritical cold neutral medium (CNM) transitioning to supercritical star-forming molecular clouds, emphasizing the need for detailed investigation. We propose a continuation of Zeeman splitting studies through high-sensitivity OH and HI absorption observations of pulsars PSR J1644-4559, J1721-3532, and J1852+0031 using Parkes. By employing an innovative phase-resolved spectral technique and extending integration times, we aim to enhance Zeeman detection sensitivity and study magnetic field transitions in the CNM and quiescent molecular clouds. This work will refine our understanding of subcritical-to-supercritical transitions in star formation, establish pulsar absorption as a robust probe of interstellar magnetic fields, and advance observational techniques critical to star formation studies.",

    "description": "The 2022-23 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2022-23 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2022-23 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers Nos.1 and 4 in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement;\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2022-23 Budget Measures;\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X;\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses;\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements; and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2022-23 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements;\r\n\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements; and\r\n\r\n3.\tAdditional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nIf a corrigendum to an entity’s PBS is issued after budget night, tables will be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2021-22\r\n* 2022-23\r\n* 2023-24\r\n* 2024-25\r\n* 2025-26\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture, Water and the Environment\r\n* Attorney-General's\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education, Skills and Employment\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health\r\n* Home Affairs\r\n* Industry, Science, Energy and Resources\r\n* Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook and Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing are included for reference as well.",

    "description": "National Estate refugia are places where species can persist and subsequently disperse from, following long term climatic and environmental change. Refugia were also defined as places where species are not eliminated by a threatening process. The impacts of the threatening process are either prevented or buffered, and species are able to persist despite being eliminated from other (non-refugial) areas. Refugia include places to which species can move to avoid a threateneing process.\n\nThe areas identified were: riparian areas, sedgelands, wetlands, rainforest, steep sandstone escarpments, native grasslands, alpine and sub alpine vegetation types, coastal heaths, banksia, paperbark, and casuarina types, coastal scribbly gum and callitris forests, mallee, rock outcrops and areas on basalt geologies, wet old growth forest and steep ecological gradients.\n\nThis dataset has been assessed against the following National Estate sub-criterion A1: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate.\n\nThis is an archived dataset jointly owned by the Commonwealth Government and NSW Governments under the NSW Regional Forest Agreements (RFA) Data Agreement of 31 March 2000.This data is available to the public from the Department and may be used by third parties for unrestricted use provided that the copyright interests of the owners are protected.\n\nAny reproduction of this dataset must carry the following statement:\nCopyright Commonwealth of Australia and New South Wales Government 1998.\nDepartmental Deed",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for April 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

Horizons and faults were interpreted including with fault polygons, for five horizons, creating TWT structure surfaces which were depth converted using the velocity model based on checkshot derived interval velocities tied to wells. The study focused on the faulting present in the shallow section, from above the Velkerri Formation to define the fault network for the shallow section of the Beelaloo Sub-basin.",

    "description": "Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) including heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capability indicators were created for City of Greater Bendigo.The dataset supports the development of a national heat vulnerability assessment toolkit for Australia, designed to identify areas and populations most susceptible to heat-related risks. The project addresses the growing need for understanding the relationship between urbanization, land surface temperature (LST), and the urban heat island effect, particularly for vulnerable communities. Integrating satellite-derived environmental data (LST, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) with socioeconomic data, this toolkit provides a comprehensive resource for building heat-resilient cities and suburbs.\nThis dataset includes both raw environmental data for the 2020-2021 Australian summer (November to March) and a calculated Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) aggregated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygon dataset. The HVI, based on the IPCC's vulnerability conceptual framework, is a composite index comprised of three core components: heat exposure (derived from LST), sensitivity to heat (influenced by socioeconomic factors), and adaptive capability. Each SA1 is assigned a vulnerability rating ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no population and 5 representing high vulnerability, based on the aggregated indicator scores and quartile distribution.\nThe methodology employs Google Earth Engine (GEE) to derive LST, NDBI, and NDVI.  The HVI, along with its components, allows for spatial analysis and facilitates understanding of the complex relationships between heat, environmental factors, and socioeconomic conditions, enabling targeted policy and decision-making at local levels. This work aims to support dynamic and interactive vulnerability assessment, enabling users to update and construct their own indicators and indices for diverse applications.\nDetailed methodology for HVI generation can be found in this paper. Additional resources are available on the project's GitHub repository, the web application, and the toolkit.",

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Darwin for 2017. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "Report on the performance of the Department of Community Safety on the Queensland Multicultural Action Plan 2011-2014 Core Outcomes. \nNote:\nOn 7 September 2020, the Queensland Government announced its intention to integrate the PSBA functions and staff into the public safety agencies of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES), as part of a wider strategy to structurally reform government statutory bodies and agencies and increase further efficiencies in the delivery of quality outcomes to Queensland communities. \nOn 27 May 2021, the Queensland Parliament passed the Debt Reduction and Savings Bill which repealed the Public Safety Business Agency Act 2014, resulting in the PSBA being abolished from 1 July 2021.\nThe disestablishment of the PSBA and the corresponding functional transition into the QPS and QFES, as per the Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 2) 2021 (AAO), was completed by 30 June 2021.\nDue to the disestablishment of the PSBA, all Open Data records within the Queensland Open Data Portal relating to the PSBA have been migrated to QPS.\nFor enquires or further information about the PSBA, please contact the QPS or QFES using the comments section or the contact us page.",

    "description": "ADDRESS_MAIN is a dataset layer of Address2 is a variant of the ADDRESS product and splits address vertically to overcome the 2 Gigabyte DBASE limit when delivering address in a MapInfo or Shapefile format.\nThe layer and table names are:-\nADDRESS_MAIN\nADDRESS_SUP\nUsers should use VICMAP_ADDRESS in all other circumstances. See metadata record VICMAP_ADDRESS (Vicmap Address) ANZVI0803002578\n\nVicmap Address is Victoria's authoritative geocoded database of property address points.  The data includes predominately, but not exclusively, locational property address identifiers assigned by Local Government, considered to be the primary creator and custodian of property address.  If accessible, other 'real life' property addresses created and used by the community, but not recognized by Local Government including retirement villages, assisted care facilities, industrial and public housing estates etc. are included. The 2011/2012 audit against Local Government addressing revealed a 97.41% match rate, increased from 92.43% in 2008/2009 following the 2009 Address Completion Initiative. Key validation fields are 'source' and 'source_verified', respectively indicating the address source and date last validated against that source. The minimum address attributes required for a property address to be included in Vicmap Address are road name and locality. However, the principal address details include the unit/house number(s), road name (including any type or suffix) and locality (town/suburb/rural district). Vicmap Address is jointly maintained with Vicmap Property (VMPROP), with every address relating to a VMPROP  record, joined through a property_pfi link. Many additional attributes are included, where available, to facilitate use and relevance to the user community.\nN.B. Specifically excluded are non-property related, and electronic address details such as email, post office (PO) boxes, roadside delivery points (RSD's), roadside mail boxes (RMB's) and the like.\nCurrent data model: Version 6.1 (Oct 2016)",

As the species occur in wetlands, the method described fully in: NSW Department of Primary Industries (2015), NSW Fish Community Status 2015 – Final Report, did not map all potential habitat. In addition to this modelling, records and previous critical habitat mapping (2007) were used. Critical habitat stream lines were identified from the 2012 NSW Topographic Hydro Line. Wetland boundaries were delineated from SEPP (Dec 2016 version).",

Current threats in this mapped dataset include urban/agricultural runoff, industrial pollution, sediment resuspension, port infrastructure and dredging, shipping accidents, oil and gas accidents. Future threats in this mapped dataset include modelled increase in sea surface temperature for 2070, modelled increase in total annual rainfall for 2070 and modelled increase in sea level rise for 2070. All threats in this mapped dataset are given as a single ArcGIS polygon shapefile composed of 10 x 10 km coastal grid cells.",

You can find a link to the parent datasets in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this dataset was to be able to map each surface water works with the volumetric entitlement without double counting the volume and to aggregate/ disaggregate the data depending on the final use.\n\n\n\nThis has not been been clipped to the Clarence Moreton PAE.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\n1\tThis dataset has not been clipped to the PAE\t\t\t\t\t\n\n2\tShare component/ entitlement information was stored in the     SW_Clarence_Moreton_WLS-EXTRACT_Wals_volume.xls and SW_Clarence_Moreton_WLS-EXTRACT.xls\t\t\t\t\t\n\n3\tThese datasets were combined in access by linking the 'LICENSE/APPROVAL' in 'SW_Clarence_Moreton_WLS-EXTRACT.xls' with the 'Linked with WA/CA' in 'SW_Clarence_Moreton_WLS-EXTRACT_Wals_volume.xls'\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4\tThe works and share/component information was joined using Access, linking the 'CWlicence' from the spatial data to the 'WAorCA_link'. This links the volumetric entitlement to the works location.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5\tWhere there was more than one works per licence, an additional column was add 'COUNT_works_per_licence_bundled'. This shows where the share component/ entitlement is double counted as it is matched to each work with the full allocation.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n6\tFor licences that have been unbundled, 'counts_works_per_licence_unbundled'\t\t\t\t\t\n\n7\tAn additional column was added 'VOLUME_PER_WORKS' which divides the allocation component by the number of works to give an allocation per works_for bundled licences.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n8\tAn additional column was added 'SHARE_PER_WORKS' which divides the share component by the number of works to give an share per works_for unbundled licences.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n9\tThe'VOLUME_PER_WORKS' and 'SHARE_PER_WORKS' column allows you to  plot the works with the share component in ArcGIS without double counting the allocation.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n10.

    "description": "We propose a study of pulsars with interpulse (IP) emissions using the Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver on the Parkes radio telescope (Murriyang). This project aims to investigate the polarization and emission properties of these pulsars through detailed modeling using the rotating vector model (RVM). Polarization profiles will be obtained over a wide frequency range, from 704 MHz to 4032 MHz. We will measure the emission height differences between the main pulse (MP) and IP as a function of frequency, allowing us to explore their frequency dependence and to test the radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) model. Spectral analyses of individual profile components will be performed to constrain the emission properties and investigate differences between the MP and IP. Additionally, we will examine quasi-periodic microstructure in both MP and IP, aiming to characterize the microstructure period and explore its potential correlation with the magnetic inclination angle. This comprehensive investigation will yield new insights into the emission geometry of pulsars with IP emissions, contributing to a better understanding of their unique characteristics within the pulsar population.",

    "title": "Current meter and tidal gauge data obtained from a mooring off Bowen Island, Jervis Bay: 05/04/89 - 27/03/90",
    "description": "A current meter mooring was installed at the entrance of Jervis Bay, just off Bowen Island. This mooring housed 2 current meters, at 12m and 30m. Over a period of approx. 1yr the mooring was deployed 5 times in nominally the same location (as illustrated). Deployment 1 - 35.11 S, 150.78 E. Deployments 2->5 - 35.11 S, 150.772 E.\nDatasets presented here correspond to data retrieved from the two current meters over the year. \n\nThe hourly datasets provide data accumulated from all 5 deployments, and provide details of the eastern & northern tidal components, cross & long-shore velocity components, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nThe subsets to these larger datasets, present individual data points collected at sample intervals of 10 mins (deployment 1) or 15 mins (deployments 2, 3, 4, 5). Compared to the hourly averaged datasets, these allow water movements to be studied over a shorter time scale. The parameters measured include the eastern and northern tidal components, water speed and direction, temperature, salinity and sigma-T.\n\nApprox deployment dates - see individual records for exact date and time of collection: 1)  5/4/89 - 4/6/89... 2) 23/6/89 - 28/8/89... 3) 30/8/89 - 13/11/89... 4) 14/11/89 - 29/1/90... 5) 31/1/90 - 28/3/90\n\nTIDE GAUGE: The tide gauge was secured to the mooring line on the sea-bed at a depth of ~35m during the first deployment. Curiously, additional tidal data was gathered from this approximate location (see record for exact coordinates) after the final deployment, between 28/3/90 and 12/7/90. The height of the tidal gauge was also raised to 10m for this additional deployment. In both datasets the tide gauge recorded temperature as well as depth.\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 5f4333e0-2ae5-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This datasets presents smooth values of the number of people unemployed in Local Government Area (LGA) regions for each quarter starting December 2010 up to June 2018. The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2018 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n\n\nFor approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and\n\n\nFor each of Australia’s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the Explanatory Notes, as well as on page 43 of the PDF Publication.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nWhere data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.\n\n\nCaution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.\n\n",

The DCNHMP focuses on the protection and management of geological and palaeontological features (ichnofossils including dinosaur footprints), that form part of a natural and cultural landscape that is relevant to The West Kimberley National Heritage listing.\nThe project area is approximately 50km of the intertidal zone (the area between highest astronomical tide and lowest astronomical tide) around the town of Broome. The project area extends 15km east-southeast from Broome along the northern shore of Roebuck Bay to Crab Creek and southwest then north away from Broome along the Dampier Peninsula coastline to conclude 25km northwest of Broome at Willie Creek.\nThe DCNHMP (2025) is the product of the federal Department of Climate Change Environment Energy and Water (DCCEEW) grant funding. \nThis dataset is one of three datasets produced by the DCNHMP.

    "description": "This dataset presents the number of distinct specialist homeless services clients by client type, sex and age group. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2018 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data and has set suppressed values (\".\") as Null.",

    "description": "The Built Environment Inventory data show the accessibility of lifestyle amenities and potential health pitfalls.\r\n\r\nThey are the result of a research project initiated by Healthy Together Geelong. The data was calculated using a sophisticated, proprietary method by Community Indicators Victoria, McCaughey Centre: VicHealth Centre for the Promotion of Mental Health and Community Wellbeing, Melbourne School of Population Health, University of Melbourne in May 2014.\r\n\r\nDistances to many dozens of features as disparate as greengrocers, bus stops, tobacco sellers, and rail trails were calculated from meshblocks of mostly residential populations. These measures were then aggregated and grouped at the neighbourhood level. The table Geelong_BuiltEnvLookup.csv describes the variables and their meanings; these variables make up the GIS file and are also in Geelong_BuiltEnv.csv. In all there are 95 measures recorded for each suburb.\r\n\r\n>*Although all due care has been taken to ensure that these data are correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by the City of Greater Geelong or by the University of Melbourne in their use.*\r\n\r\nThe land use dataset was categorised into six different land uses: retail, \r\ncommercial, health/community, recreation, residential, and other. These categorisations were made on the basis of data supplied by the City of Greater Geelong and VicMap Planning Zones 2013. Land use mix was calculated using an entropy formula. The resulting land use mix measure is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates homogenous land use (i.e. the entire suburb is the same land use) and 1 indicates heterogeneous land use (i.e. there are equal areas of each of the different types of land use of interest). \r\n\r\nDistances to sites were calculated along street centrelines. Site information was supplied by the City of Greater Geelong.\r\n\r\nNote that densities are often not spatial densities (eg. number per hectare) but, rather, represent number of sites per population measure or per kilometre of roads.",

    "description": "This dataset identifies the project boundaries for registered Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) Scheme area based projects. Area based projects are generally savanna burning and sequestration activities.\r\n\r\nThese ACCU Scheme projects are registered across a declared project area identified by project proponents at the time of registration. These project areas generally encompass the entire cadastral boundaries for the properties for which the participants intend to conduct their project activities and for which they hold legal right.\r\n\r\nFor sequestration projects the project area does not generally represent the actual extent of a project activity which is generally a subset of the project area. These subset areas are known as Carbon Estimation Areas (CEA) which are defined by rules set out in the individual ACCU Scheme methods. A project can contain one or many CEAs.\r\n\r\nThe dataset includes basic attribution including:\r\nScheme Participant;\r\nProject Name;\r\nProject ID;\r\nMethod;\r\nMethod Type;\r\nProject Description;\r\nDate Project Registered;\r\nProject location (State);\r\nProject location (Postcode);\r\nPermanence Period; \r\nProject Status (Active or Revoked); and,\r\nArea Ha\r\n\r\nThe Clean Energy Regulator publishes and maintains a project register which contains further details about projects registered under the Emissions Reduction Fund. The project register is published on the Clean Energy Regulator website at https://cer.gov.au/markets/reports-and-data/accu-project-and-contract-register?view=Projects and is the point of truth for information about ACCU Scheme projects.\r\n\r\nThe project register contains attributes not in the spatial dataset, such as, the number of Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) issued, whether any units have been relinquished, or if that land has a carbon maintenance obligation in place. However, the Project Id attribute (PROJ_ID) can be used to link the mapping data with the project register if analysis of those attributes is required.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. Users should be aware that the project register is updated on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\n2. The dataset does not contain the boundaries of ten projects which have had their location suppressed or partially suppressed.\r\n\r\n3. The dataset contains revoked projects. These are identified as being revoked in the status column\r\n",

The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions.

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for May 1989. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0550, 0600-1150, 1200-1750 and 1800-2350. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 10 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

Seven parameters subjected to a strict quality control are given: temperature, potential temperature, salinity, oxygen, silicate, nitrate, phosphate.",

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

Modelled on the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report [In]Sight was developed in collaboration with Deloitte Access Economics and combines data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Social Health Atlas of Australia.\nA regions physical endowment in terms of both the access to natural resources and the physical attributes of the region such as climate are hugely influential in determining a regions competitiveness. Access to natural resources can create economic opportunities through offering inputs to production (such as access to water or good quality soil) and can be used to generate production outputs (such as minerals or extractives).\nSimilarly the physical make up of a region can be an important determinant of the region's ability to connect to external markets. If a region is situated on the ocean they may have access to ports a viable tourism industry and be naturally more connected to wider markets than an inland region. In contrast an area which is difficult to access such as a mountainous region or a remote community will have more difficulty exporting goods and therefore be at an automatic comparative disadvantage.",

    "description": "The 2025-26 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. The 2025-26 Budget was tabled in the Parliament on Tuesday, 25 March 2025 (Budget night).\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2025-26 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available \r\n   after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 1 will be available\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 will be available (~8.30pm after Budget night)\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2025-26 Budget.\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nInformation about the PBS Excel files and CSV: The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers (No.1) and (No.4) in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2025-26 Budget Measures\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2025-26 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1.\tIntra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements\r\n2.\tEntity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements and\r\n3.\tFor some entities (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited) who receive grant funding and who are not appropriated via the Appropriation Bills, their expenses may be reported as part of their portfolio department's program expenses (as part of the general government sector).\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2024-25\r\n* 2025-26\r\n* 2026-27\r\n* 2027-28\r\n* 2028-29\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nAll current Portfolios will be included in the in line-item CSV file.\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook and Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing are included for reference as well.\r\n \r\n",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nEcologic Hydrologic Response Variables (HRVs) are the hydrological characteristics of the system that are instrumental in maintaining and shaping ecological services and can potentially change due to coal resource development. These data refer to the ecologic HRVs for the Namoi subregion for the 54 simulation nodes.  The nine ecologic HRVs were computed under CRDP and Baseline conditions, respectively and the ACRD is the difference between the Baseline and CRDP.  \n\n\n\nA full description of each of the variables are given in:\n\n\n\nd2da0bc3-2eb8-408b-9d12-13f5c1d6d683  Namoi ecological Hydrological Response Variables (HRVs)\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nSelected ACRD future HRV normalized data from the source data, extracted and cross-tabulated in MS Access.
