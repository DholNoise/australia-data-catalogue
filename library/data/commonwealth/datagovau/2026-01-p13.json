    "description": "The Intertidal Marine Vegetation Strategies (IMVS) include separate reports and data packages that cover the floodplains of NSW estuaries. The study included extensive GIS modelling, mapping, data interrogation and an examination of literature to recommend management actions and improve the overall management of saltmarsh and mangrove habitats in NSW now and into the future. The geodata packages include information on high macrophyte potential, identified hotspots, recommended management actions (under Hydrology; Sediments; Vegetation; and People and Planning approaches), current mapped intertidal macrophytes, and projected intertidal vegetation with 0.5m and 1.5 m sea level rise. Links to relevant resources are also provided.\nImportantly, a landholders’ right to carry out agricultural or developmental activities on their land is not altered by their properties being identified in any IMVS documents and any involvement in delivering recommended management actions is entirely voluntary.\n\nNote that the recommendations are based on site-specific conditions and available information at the time of writing. As both environmental and anthropogenic conditions are dynamic, appropriate management strategies may be subject to change and current site assessments are required. Initiating changes to protect or restore hydrology or sedimentation may be complex and have unanticipated environmental, social, cultural and economic outcomes. When recommended projects are planned, expert assessment and a scrutiny of proposed actions by relevant authorities is still warranted as works may result in changes to the key ecological drivers of intertidal wetlands.\n\nImplementation of recommended actions must comply with regulatory requirements. Proposal assessments must be undertaken on a case-by-case basis as the approval pathway is not the same for every relevant Local Environmental Plan or SEPP. The planning approval pathway also depends on how a proposal is classified, the specific works to be undertaken, the location and land zoning, and whether the proponent is a public authority or private entity. There may also be other regulatory approvals that apply. Given the complexities of jurisdiction and classifications of works it is important to seek and retain written planning advice (for example, from a town planner and relevant approval authorities) during the planning stage so that environmental protection actions can be demonstrated as being compliant with current legislation and policy.",

    "description": "The purpose of this investigation was to quantitatively describe the colour patterns of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis and their ability to change on a socially significant timescale. Five experiments were conducted as part of this investigation, with fieldwork completed in East Point Reserve, Darwin (NT) from Nov. to Jan. in 04/05 and 05/06. The five experiments were: \n\n1) Quantifying colour patterns on the black carapace of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis- To examine the relationship between colouration, carapace size, and sex. This information was used to construct images illustrating the probable colour patterns of various groups of crabs.\n\n2) Colour changes associated with moulting - Cages were constructed and stocked with crabs which had been measured and photographed. In total 21 individuals (11 females, 10 males) were photographed through at least one moult. \n\n3) Colour changes associated with the semilunar cycle - During one semilunar cycle, from one neap tide to the next, digital photographs were taken of 22 crabs (10 males, 12 females) active in the cages at approximately low tide. Photos were examined to observe any colour changes on a day to day basis. \n\n4) Daily colour changes - Twenty-seven crabs (13 males, 14 females) were observed on the day after spring tide over several semilunar cycles. Digital photos of the crabs were taken before, during and after low tide. These photographs were examined for any changes in colour or pattern. \n\n5) Rapid colour changes - The ability of the crab to change colour over a 20 minute period was assessed using a portable spectrophotometer.",

DNA barcoding will aid in evaluating the extent of cephalopod biodiversity including revealing cryptic species and phylogeographic structure. Confirmation of species identities is also essential as glands from multiple individuals will be required for detailed proteomic analysis of the proteins produced by the octopus posterior salivary glands.  The chemical composition of the secretions will be determined through the application of multidisciplinary techniques, including cDNA library construction, mass spectrometry, molecular modelling and bioactivity testing.

The data is an extract from the DPIRD land use areas of interest database.  The land use database contains block and belt planted mallee trees.  Only belt planting areas of interest have been extracted in this dataset. \n\nBelt planting regions were determined by digitising areas identified from orthophotography. \n\nIn a small region of the state field verification work was carried out to help validate the mallee data. Field data was used to extrapolate interpretation of mallee areas beyond the field work area and to better identify belt regions of oil mallee.\n\nThe belt plantings were gridded using 14.1km by 14.1km or 200km2 sized grids representing 20,000ha.  The grids were attributed with “Total_Area” - the total area of mallee in the grid block and “Ground_Truthed” - if there was any ground truthing within the grid area.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2009 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

The data is sourced from daily fishing returns recorded by the foreign fishers while at sea. Data provided is by individual fishing operation. Weights are estimates only.\r\n\r\nAppropriate use and limitations of the data  \r\n==  \r\nThe catch weight data in logbooks are estimates only which have been recorded by fishers while at sea. Fishers usually cannot accurately weigh fish at sea, so the estimated weights are mostly based on volume (for example, the size and number of boxes of fish caught). At this time, positions are also estimates as GPS navigation systems did not exist.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer  \r\n--  \r\nThe data provided by AFMA is raw (unprocessed) data and may contain errors or be incomplete. Errors are more likely in the species caught in low volumes. AFMA makes no warranty or representation that the data is accurate or complete. Those who choose to use this data should make their own enquiries as to its accuracy and completeness and AFMA assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the data provided, or for any decision by a person who chooses to rely on the data.",

    "title": "Mobility Australia - Queensland Monthly Rail Origin-Destination Flow (SA2) 2020",
    "description": "This dataset estimates human mobility through origin destination (OD) movement flow among the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) regions in Queensland (QLD), connected by public transport (PT) networks. The SA2 regions of Queensland connected by buses, trains, trams and ferries have been used to evaluate OD movement flows. The passenger OD movement data among different stations (or the station-based OD flow) are first estimated using a statistical estimation methodology. The stations-based OD flow data are then translated into region-based OD matrices using the state-of-art method. For more information please see the original metadata file here.\nHuman mobility data is a key ingredient in various areas and domains of research including epidemiology, policy and administration, criminology, transportation, logistics and supply chains, environmental management and, pollution and contamination. High quality human mobility data provided by telecommunication companies collected from call data records (CDRs) is available at prohibitive cost with restrictive licensing, keeping it out of reach for the majority of research community. On the other hand, there is an abundance of high-quality public data, reporting different aspects of mobility. Examples are the public transport patronage and information about the usage of the Australian road network. These datasets are collected by different organisations and government departments and are presented in various formats. For instance, data may be collected at different spatial (e.g. at state or postcode levels) and temporal scales and be presented in the form of passenger counts or aggregated movement flows. This dataset addresses the general lack of national scale comprehensive human mobility dataset in Australia by transforming available mobility data into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis in a broad range of research areas. Merging the various individual datasets into Australia's first comprehensive, national-scale human mobility data asset drastically improves the quality and coverage of existing datasets.\nThe Mobility Australia project received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/DP702) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).\nThe original data tables were structured in a matrix-like format. AURIN employed a methodology to merge diverse datasets into a comprehensive one, categorising based on transportation types (e.g., trains, buses, rails, ferries), years (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.), and temporal scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Subsequently, AURIN spatially enabled the original data by employing the 2021 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The flow between origin and destination pairs is visually represented using line geometry.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women giving birth for the first time who gave birth by caesarean section. This has been calculated with the number of selected females giving birth for the first time who gave birth by caesarean section, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as the event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nCaesarean section is an operative procedure to remove the baby through an incision through a female's abdomen and uterus.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

The Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) developed a methodology to assess the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation components of the ISC using remote sensing data, specifically LIDAR and aerial photography. \n\nA State Wide mapping project was undertaken in 2010-13 to accurately map the Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation metrics of the ISC . Other ISC metrics were not assessed in the project and were derived from other sources.\n\nThe Physical Form and Riparian Vegetation Metric  products are a combination of mapped Vector and Raster data as well as Tabular Summary Statistics about the mapped features. In the context of the project, the term Metrics is used to refer to both the mapped features and the summary statistics. \n\nRemote sensing data used includes 15cm true colour and infra-red aerial photography and four return multi-pulse LiDAR data.  This source data was used to derive a variety of Raster data sets including Digital Terrain Models, Slope, Vegetation Height and Vegetation Cover.  The Digital Terrain and Slope rasters were used to map Physical Form metrics including Stream Bed, Top of Bank and River Centre Lines while the Vegetation Height and Cover rasters were used to map the Riparian Vegetation metrics.\nThe Project Report \"Aerial Remote Sensing for Physical Channel Form and Riparian Vegetation Mapping\" describes the remote sensing and mapping approach used to create this data set.",

    "description": "The Indicative Australian Urban Development Risk Model (2019) predicts the risk of urban expansion for the decade 2016-2026, at a 250m cell size. It is based on extrapolating identifiable trends from 2006-2016, stratified within Australia’s 109 Significant Urban Areas and eight Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016). It has been developed, as an experimental dataset, by the Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN), in the Commonwealth Department of the Environment and Energy, with the intent of aiding assessment of threat exposure for threatened species. Four parameters logically correlated with urban development were identified, assessed and extrapolated as individual risk values. These were then combined with equal weights in an index. Index values for all grid cells were classified into five risk classes and mapped in a spatial model which also integrates Protected Areas (minimal risk) and existing urban areas, for completeness. The model is restricted to Australia’s 109 Significant Urban Areas and eight Greater Capital City Statistical Areas.\nThe indicative Australian Urban Development Risk Model is based on an assumption that recent-past trends in urban expansion (i.e the transition from non-urban land use to urban land use) will continue linearly, and that parameters associated with past expansion are valid predictors of future expansion.\nThe model is underpinned by a conceptual logic, derived within ERIN, based on known datasets and their reasonable association with patterns of urbanisation. Specifically, ERIN predicts a higher urban development risk for non-urban locations with:\n\n\nproximity to existing high urban development areas\n\n\nhigh increasing trend in street address density\n\n\nland uses evidently prone to urbanisation and\n\n\nattractive geomorphology.\n\n\nFor more detailed information please read the Department of Energy and Environments Find Environmental Data site.",

    "description": "This Bio Acoustic data was collected in May 2012 under the IMOS Ship of Opportunity (SOOP) Bio Acoustic (BA) program on Australian Wild Tuna's Santo Rocca (IMOS platform code: LFB13191P).\n\nDeparted:  Australia, May 01, 2012\nArrived:  \t Australia, May 03, 2012\n\nBio acoustic signals allow understanding how mid-water prey species (known collectively as micronekton) such as small fish, squid, krill and jellyfish are distributed. \n\nMid-water prey form the core of the ocean food web, transferring energy from primary producers at the ocean surface to top predators such as tunas, billfish, sharks, seals and seabirds.The mass and distribution of micronekton reflects broad-scale patterns in the structure and function of the ocean, as well as the dynamics of marine ecosystems. \n\nAcoustic mapping is done from fishing and scientific vessels that are equipped with scientifically-calibrated 38 kHz digital echo-sounders that record a slice of acoustic backscatter to a depth of 1500 meters.",

From there, they are downloaded by NOAA for their In Situ Quality Monitoring web site (iQUAM2) and made available for satellite SST validation.\nThe SBE 38 SST data are used within the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for real-time satellite SST validation and ingested into real-time SST analyses which are then used as the boundary condition for Numerical Weather Prediction models.\nThe meteorological and SST data are uploaded onto the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) for global dissemination to Meteorological Agencies, and separately supplied to the SAMOS (http://samos.coaps.fsu.edu/html/) Project for air-sea flux research.\nThe real-time SBE 38 SST data are currently (2017) used in the following data products (accessed via the GTS):\n• International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS R3.0) (http://icoads.noaa.gov/) \n• NOAA NCEI Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature version 4 (ERSST.v4) (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/extended-reconstructed-sea-surface-temperature-ersst-v4)\n• Hadley Centre SST Data Set (HadSST3) (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst3/)\n• Global Ocean Surface Underway Data (GOSUD) Project (http://www.gosud.org/) \n• Bureau of Meteorology daily and weekly SST analyses (http://www.bom.gov.au/marine/sst.shtml) \n• NOAA NCEI “Reynolds” daily global OISST analysis (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst)\n• NASA JPL “MUR” 1 km daily global SST analysis (https://mur.jpl.nasa.gov/)\n• UK Met Office “OSTIA” daily global SST analysis (http://ghrsst-pp.metoffice.com/pages/latest_analysis/ostia.html)\n• CMC daily global SST analysis\n• Ourocean “G1SST” global daily 1 km SST analysis (https://ourocean.jpl.nasa.gov/SST)\nAs part of the underway data gathering system, other datasets are produced (e.g., pCO2, ISAR SST) which are processed separately and have their own metadata records.\nData are recorded at 5 second intervals. Near real-time data are available via the link \"Visualisation tool for Underway Data.\" This dataset will be processed and archived within the  CSIRO Oceans &amp; Atmosphere (O&amp;A) Information and Data Centre (IDC) in Hobart (TAS). Data are available at time intervals of 5 sec (NetCDF format), 10 sec and 5 min (ASCII format).

This flood has a 50% chance of being experienced at least once in a person's lifetime. The 1 in 100 AEP flood has been generally adopted in Australia and overseas as the basis for floodplain management planning.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nFloodplain - the portion of a river valley next to the river channel which is covered with water when the river overflows its banks during major river flows. The term also applies to land adjacent to estuaries which is subject to flooding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDesignated flood event (DFE) - used for planning purposes and is generally the 1 in 100 (1%) AEP \"designed\" flood event. However, a designated flood event could be based on an \"actual\" flood event (e.g. Moora 1999 flood event) or an alternative scenario (i.e. Yakamia Creek - 1 in 100 (1%) AEP flood event plus sea level rise).\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMaximum channel capacity (MCC) - the maximum flow that a waterway can contain before breaking out across the floodplain during a flood event. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nProbable maximum flood (PMF) - the largest flood that could conceivably occur at a particular location, resulting from probable maximum precipitation. The PMF defines the extent of flood-prone land. Generally, it is not physically or financially possible to provide general protection against this event.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nAustralian Height Datum (AHD) - is a geodetic datum for altitude measurement in Australia. It was adopted in 1971 by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping is to be referred. The datum is based on the mean sea level (1966-1968) being assigned the value 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at 30 tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "Data were collected as part of the FutureReef MAP project, a three-year project designed to monitor ocean chemistry along the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef. The Future Reef MAP project is funded by Rio Tinto Alcan and administered by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with an equal co-investment by CSIRO. The project is the first large-scale CO2 observing system established on the Great Barrier Reef using the Rio Tinto ship, RTM Wakmatha. The research is targeted at providing information on the CO2 uptake and the controls on ocean acidification change in the region. It is providing foundation data needed to assess the vulnerability of the GBR reefs to ocean acidification. This dataset contains quality controlled underway measurements of the fugacity of CO2, atmospheric pressure, and sea surface temperature and salinity. The data management and distribution of these data were supported by the CSIRO Carbon Collaboration Cluster and the Australian Coastal Ecosystem Facility.",

Detailed geological and geophysical reports and plans have also been prepared for all known radioactive mineral prospects, costeaning and diamond drilling has been undertaken to test some of the prospects and inspectional reports have been made on practically all airborne scintillometer anomalies located during surveys in 1952, and on some of those found during 1953. Prospecting operations have also been undertaken. A summary of the activities of the Bureau during 1953 and the results achieved is given in the following pages, and further details can be obtained from reports mentioned in the list of references.",

The Registers of demands document claims made for leases to pastoral runs in the various Pastoral Districts of Queensland from mainly during the 1850s and 1860s.\nInformation recorded includes gazettal number for the Lease (in lieu of a Lease number); names of Claimants, Transferees and Lessees, Name of Property (Run), notes on rents, lease renewals, re-tenders, forfeitures, and resumptions into reserves (e.g. Railway reserves).\nDating across the registers in inconsistent. Date/Year recorded in the index is derived from the date published in the gazette or date of lease or date notified depending on which date was recorded; some dates are estimated from the remarks column in lieu of any other information recorded or from the letter references for Lessees and Transferees e.g. 1850 is derived from letter reference 50/3559. The Index dates reflect the first date of the Lease or Gazettal publication; subsequent dates for transfers of leases have not been included.\nAccepted tenders for Runs in the Colony of Queensland were published in the gazettes and newspapers of the era which can be searched through TROVE.",

    "description": "This dataset presents counts of payment recipients by payment type for the quarter ending December 2014. The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 19 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;20' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 20.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;20' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

This voyage was staffed by only one GSM team member, thus 24 hours acquisition was not possible and there may be gaps in the data record.\n\nThe Kongsberg EM712 multibeam echosounder was used to acquire seafloor bathymetry and backscatter information and watercolumn backscatter transiting between the Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) mooring site and South Tasman Rise.\n\nThe EM712 provides a 0.5° by 1° transmit and receive angular resolution respectively. The echosounder's nominal frequency range is from 40 to 100 kHz. \n\nData are stored in <em>.kmall raw format for bathymetry and backscatter and </em>.kmwcd format for watercolumn backscatter at CSIRO. \n\nThere are 25 files totalling 4.16 GB of raw data and 25 files totalling 24.5 GB of watercolumn data in this dataset. \n\nSound velocity profiles were applied to this data during data acquisition. Bathymetry data contained in *.kmall format are corrected for motion and position. \n\nGPS tide was computed using the EGM2008 model and applied to the processed data. Processed data has had outliers removed. \n\nAdditional information regarding this dataset, including further information on processing streams, is contained in the GSM data acquisition and processing report.",

The data spans the financial years in the period of July 2013 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.\nThe rate of patients per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of patients recorded in a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: VEMD Patient Rate = (Number of Patients/ERP count) x 100,000. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:Crime Statistics Australia.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nTo maintain confidentiality, person-based counts with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.\n\n\nFor the financial years from July 2013 to June 2016, patients presenting for family violence reasons were identified with the human intent injuries of 'Maltreatment, assault by domestic partner' or 'Child neglect/maltreatment by parent or guardian'.\n\n\nFor the financial year 2016-2017 and onwards, the human intent data item changed, and patients presenting for family violence reasons are identified using the following categories: sexual assault by current or former intimate partner; sexual assault by other family member (excluding intimate partner); neglect, maltreatment, assault by current or former intimate partner or; neglect, maltreatment, assault by other family member (excluding intimate partner).\n\n\nDue to methodological improvements made to the calculation of financial year, numbers for some historical years have changed slightly from what was reported in the June 2017 publication of the Family Violence Database.\n\n",

    "title": "Interim Classification of Aquatic Ecosystems in the Murray Darling Basin based on the Australian National Aquatic Ecosystems (ANAE) Classification Framework - Wetlands",
    "description": "The wetlands component of the Interim Classification of Aquatic Ecosystems is a compilation of wetland polygon mapping for the Murray-Darling Basin using the best available mapping from state jurisdictions (South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales), Australian Government agencies and other organisations.  Data sources range in scale from 1:25,000 to 1:250,000. The interim Australian National Aquatic Ecosystem (ANAE) classification framework has been applied to all wetland polygons varying by system type (lacustrine, palustrine, riverine, estuarine and springs). Floodplains are classified in a separate layer. Attribute values and final wetland types are included in the attribute data table.\nThis dataset was previously split by systemtype into four separate datasets, but has been re-amalagamated into a single dataset.This data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence. More information can be found at http://www.ausgoal.gov.au/creative-commons.\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2015\nLicenced for use under Creative Commons Australia Attribution\nVictoria\nVictoria maintains an inventory of wetlands (WETLAND_CURRENT) which is designed for use in Victorian wetland projects and is subject to ongoing validation and updates. WETLAND_CURRENT can be obtained from the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (see http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/forestry-and-land-use/maps-imagery-and-data\nfor further details). For lacustrine and palustrine aquatic ecosystems, the MDB_ANAE geodatabase is more suited to wetland projects involving other jurisdictions. While much of the data for lacustrine and palustrine wetlands was sourced from WETLAND_CURRENT, there may be some inconsistencies between MDB_ANAE geodatabase and WETLAND_CURRENT. The two datasets can be linked through the AltSrcID (MDB_ANAE geodatabase) and Wetland_No (WETLAND_CURRENT data set) fields.\nSA\nDue to the Basin-wide nature of this dataset, accuracy of final classes has not been ground truthed comprehensively, which could impact results of any analysis using this data. Therefore it is imperative that this dataset is assessed as to fitness for use in any application and decisions made about further levels of validation required. Significant care should be taken if information derived from this dataset is to guide decision making, form binding agreements regarding target setting, compliance of any form, or monitoring of achievements, this includes for the purpose of summarising areas of wetland types.

The data spans the months of 2016 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "Horticulture farms in the Murray-Darling Basin  presents key farm performance measures for irrigated citrus, pome and stone fruit growing farms in the Basin, including data on water trading and use of irrigation technologies, with an emphasis on results from 2012-13 to 2014-15. \r\n\r\n ABARES has conducted surveys of irrigation farms in selected industries and regions in the Murray-Darling Basin since 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) funded this latest survey. \r\n\r\n This report focuses on citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit growing farms in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin accounts for about three-quarters of Australia's citrus, pome fruit and stone fruit production with a large percentage of these crops grown in the southern Basin. \r\n\r\n Average farm cash income for citrus farms increased to around $90 000 in 2013-14 and then declined to around $72 000 in 2014-15. Pome fruit and stone fruit growers achieved average farm cash incomes of around $108 000 and $75 000 in 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively. \r\n\r\n In 2014-15 the average rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) was 0.4 per cent for citrus growers and 0.7 per cent for pome and stone fruit growers. \r\n\r\n An increasing proportion of citrus farms used drip/trickle systems and fewer farms used low-throw sprinklers. Other irrigation systems used by citrus growers included micro sprays, overhead sprinklers and flood/furrow irrigation. Low-throw sprinklers and drip/trickle irrigation were also the most commonly used systems on stone fruit farms. Pome fruit was irrigated using a range of systems, with the most popular systems being low-throw sprinklers, micro sprays and drip/trickle irrigation. \r\n\r\n Few citrus growers traded water from 2010-11 to 2012-13, but around 54 per cent were net sellers of water in 2013-14. Most pome and stone fruit growers were non-traders in all years except 2007-08 and 2013-14. ",

The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for August 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The overall objectives of the Floodplain Risk Management Study (FRMS) were to assess the impacts of flooding, review existing Council policies as they relate to development of land in flood liable areas, consider options for the management of flood affected land and to develop a Floodplain Risk Management Plan (FRMP) which:\ni) Proposes modifications to existing Council policies to ensure that the development of flood affected land is undertaken so as to be compatible with the flood hazard and risk.\nii) Proposes Flood Planning Levels for the various land uses in the floodplain.\niii) Sets out the recommended program of works and measures aimed at reducing over time, the social, environmental and economic impacts of flooding.\niv) Provides a program for implementation of the proposed works and measures.\n\nThe FRMS focuses on Main Stream Flooding from the Boorowa River, Ryans Creek and Ryans Tributary, as well as two major un-named tributaries, Minor Tributary Flooding caused by high flows in the minor un-named tributaries which drain to the aforementioned watercourses, and Major Overland Flow areas which occur in the urbanised parts of Boorowa and its immediate surrounds.",

    "description": "The Murray-Darling Basin Plan (available at http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012L02240) was developed under the Commonwealth Water Act 2007 and aims to deliver a coordinated approach to water use by States and Territories in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), underpinned by a commitment to restoring the long-term health of rivers and wetlands in the Basin. To achieve this, the Basin Plan sets a long term average Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) for surface water and groundwater use across the major valleys in the MDB, and incorporates an Environmental Watering Plan (EWP) that ensures surplus water beyond SDLs is made available for the natural floodplain and wetland systems. The EWP is central to the Basin Plan as it aims to achieve the best possible environmental outcomes in its use of environmental water, in terms of size, timing and nature of river flows. The EWP is supported by the Environmental Water Recovery Strategy, a voluntary water buyback instrument (SEWPAC 2012).\nThe long term average SDL for surface water flow is currently set by the Basin Plan at 10,873 gigalitres per year (GL/y). This includes 3,468 GL/y for the northern Basin, which establishes a water ‘saving’ of 390 GL/y from water allocations previously set under the Living Murray initiative (MDBA 2011). These savings are available as ‘environmental water’ which is regulated by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO) via the EWP.\nWater allocations in the northern Basin are currently under review via the Northern Basin Review, which is due for finalisation in mid-2016. This review is expected to improve environmental science in relation to floodplain systems in the Condamine-Balonne and Barwon-Darling River systems, and may recommend changes to the Basin Plan accordingly. A key part of the Review is to improve knowledge about environmental assets within river systems of the northern Basin (e.g. floodplain and wetland vegetation, fish, water birds), and how they respond and interact to fluctuations in surface water flow. Improved knowledge about the native vegetation of inland floodplain systems is fundamental to the Northern Basin Review.\nTo improve information about the distribution and extent of floodplain and wetland vegetation types in the northern Basin, Eco Logical Australia (ELA) was commissioned by the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to map the distribution of plant community types (PCTs) within a large section of the Darling floodplain west of Louth, and within the Condamine-Balonne system south of the NSW-Queensland border. An improved knowledge about the distribution and extent of floodplain PCTs will inform how environmental water allocations might be refined, and is thus an important component of the Northern Basin Review.\nFor more information please refer to the technical report Eco Logical Australia 2015. Vegetation of the Barwon-Darling and Condamine-Balonne floodplain systems of New South Wales: Mapping and survey of plant community types. Prepared for Murray-Darling Basin Authority. \nAttributes: \nPCT_ID = NSW Plant Community Type Code \nPCT_LABEL = Plant Community Type Label \nBROAD_VEG = Broad Vegetation Type \nHYDROL_ECOL = Hydro-Ecological Functional Group \nVEG_FORMAT = Vegetation Formation \nVEG_CLASS = Vegetation Class \nFloodplain = Floodplain vegetation (yes or no) \nMAP_LABEL = Short vegetation label suitable for display on map products \nRE = Regional Ecosystem Code RE_LABEL = Regional Ecosystem Label ACCURACY = Attribute accuracy (values 1 to 5) \n5 - Verified in the field by either full floristic, rapid or API (observational) site \n4 - Not verified in the field but likely to be correct due to extrapolation from similar verified pattern or verified in field but uncertain of boundary \n3 - Probably correct although could be one of a few related communities \n2 - Possibly correct but might be one of several other communities \n1 - Unlikely to be correct\nVIS_ID 4454",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions. The aAGRICa case\nincludes current agricultural inputs of water from\nirrigation.EvapCanopy.00.Agric, EvapCanopy.01.Agric a| EvapCanopy.12.Agric a\nMean annual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aAGRICa (present day)\nscenarioEvapCanopy.00.Base, EvapCanopy.01.Base a| EvapCanopy.12.Base a Mean\nannual and monthly canopy transpiration (mm) in the aBASEa (pre-1788)\nscenarioData is in geographics and GDA94.\n\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_ctab_r9cl\n__01411a02.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

    "description": "The walking legs, carapaces and chelae of ocypodid crabs, particularly the well-studied fiddler crabs, are often brilliantly coloured. However, despite this array of colours there is still some debate over whether ocypodid crabs are actually capable of colour vision and what role it might play.\n\nThe aim of this experiment was to test the colour vision capabilities of fiddler crabs in a biologically significant context. To determine whether Uca mjoebergi use differences in spectral composition to discriminate between colours, and thus possess colour vision, I tested their ability to consistently discriminate yellow from various shades of grey. Experiments were conducted in October 2005 on an intertidal mudflat in the East Point Reserve, Darwin.\n\nWhen the crabs were reproductively active, during neap tide, wandering females were caught and placed under a container 15 cm from two identical plaster casts of a U. mjoebergi male's 21.8 mm claw. Females were given a choice between a yellow claw (Dulux Tiny Tin yellow enamel) and a claw painted white, 75% grey, 50% grey, 25% grey or black (made by mixing appropriate amounts of white and black Dulux Tiny Tin enamel paint). It was recorded which claw the female approached within 2 cm. Each combination was tested until 15 females successfully made a choice. \n\nThe same experiment was conducted with two tethered, size matched (within 1 mm claw length), and handedness-matched males in place of the plaster claws. The males were tethered with 1 cm of cotton super-glued to their carapace and tied to a nail stuck in the ground, allowing some restricted movement. I painted the males' claw either with the same yellow paint as above or with the light yellow paint, made by mixing one part yellow to 14 parts white paint. The experiment was repeated 25 times using different pairs of males and new females each time.",

Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) developed CLAM in 2004 when contracted by the NSW State Government to provide sustainability assessments of 8 coastal lakes. Several projects have since been established directly with local government and NRM groups.\n\nTo date, 27 CLAMs have been developed in New South Wales, where they generally fit within estuary management or catchment management plans. To develop these CLAMs and build local capacity to maintain them, ANU-Enterprise Pty Ltd - the commercial company of ANU developed an Accreditation Scheme whereby local consultants are trained in the CLAM approach.",

    "description": "The overall aims were to provide data on the distribution of deep seabed habitats and fauna that are amenable to scientific hypothesis testing, can be immediately applied to marine resource management processes, and that enable strategic development of tools and techniques for understanding the processes that maintain deep sea biodiversity. This work was to support the process of NWR Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories, distribution maps and conservation values. Data will be collected at scientific reference sites from potential MPA areas that can be re-visited for monitoring purposes in the future. Sampling along environmental gradients (geographic range and depth) in this section of Australia's coast will also provide the opportunity to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses. Further refinement of predictive methods for identifying seabed habitat types, initially developed in temperate and cool-temperate environments, will be enabled by data collection from this tropical location in Australia. We intended to highlight the importance of this underlying science as a modern \"Voyage of Discovery\" given the likely significance of the findings in terms of Australia's biodiversity and its biogeography and evolution. (From Voyage Plan)\nThis record describes the biological samples taken during the survey. Fishes were lodges in the CSIRO Fish collection, invertebrate specimens were photographed and distributed to Australian museums for identification by taxonomists, focusing on sponges, corals, echinoderms, ascidians, molluscs and crustaceans. To date (as per Dec 2016) we are aware of 27 manuscripts of taxonomic revisions and/or descriptions that have used material collected from this survey.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who did not see or delayed seeing a dentist, hygienist or dental specialist due to cost in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This data was collected in March 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R4.\n\nDeparted:   Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, March 02, 2012\nArrived:  Hobart Australia, March 07, 2012\n\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women giving birth for the first time who gave birth by non-instrumental vaginal birth, by the mother's usual residence. This has been calculated with the number of selected females giving birth for the first time who gave birth by non-instrumental vaginal birth, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2014-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nA non-instrumental vaginal birth is one in which the baby is born through the vagina without the assistance of instruments (vacuum or forceps).\n\n\nNon-instrumental vaginal births include spontaneous vaginal and vaginal breech.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nData for Statistical Local Area Level 3 (SA3) of mother's usual residence reported using a 3-year aggregate, 2014-2016.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "Data Notes:\n\n\n'SA4 grouping’ and ‘remoteness’ describe areas within NSW. Both are ABS standard categories. SA4 group relates to a predefined geographical area, based on population and labour markets, whereas remoteness is based on density of population.\n\n\nFrom 2016 onwards, geographical data is reported by the ABS remoteness structure. The ABS remoteness structure uses 5 categories: Major Cities, Inner Regional, Outer Regional, Remote and Very Remote. Prior to 2016, MCEECDYA categories were used, which divided schools into four categories.\n\n\nSince 2014, the department has used a geographical structure based on the new ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Groups of ASGS Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries in NSW have been combined into 11 groups for reporting and publication of department data. Previous publications compared enrolments in DEC regions. Further information on SA4 groups is available in the Statistical Bulletin Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nData Source:\n\nSchools and Students: Statistical Bulletin.

Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) boundaries from the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). It was then reprojected from EPSG 4326 (WGS84) to 4283 (GDA94).\nAdditional columns have been added corresponding to the matching boundaries of the 2016 ABS Statistical Area Levels 2, 3 and 4, and the 2020 Local Government Areas. These were spatially joined using the centroid of each polygon, and therefore, should only be used as an approximation. Furthermore, grid cells residing outside of these boundaries, such as offshore or over rivers, are assigned a null value in these columns.",

This experiment was designed to examine whether the nearest female or male neighbour was correlated with the size of a focal male. Throughout different experiments a total of 746 neighbour relations have been investigated. The size data collected during these experiments (531 male-female neighbours : 215 male-male neighbours) is the basis of this dataset. \n\nFemale size was found to be positively correlated with the size of her nearest male neighbour. Male size was also positively correlated with the size of his nearest male neighbour, but more weakly than between male-female pairs.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted on various transects within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. This record describes CTD data from the transect running across the mouth of Jervis Bay, running from Point Perpendicular in the north, to Bowen Island in the south. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~5 stations were chosen on the transect, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nFor each day of sampling two resources are provided: 1) An excel document providing details of sampling locations and the raw CTD data collected, and 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station. For a number of sampling days a third resource is offered, providing vertically averaged CTD data over 4m depth bins.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "The Victorian Training Market Reports are an on-going series of reports\nproduced by DEECD, with the aim of providing summaries of Victorian Vocational\nEducation and Training (VET) market performance and responsiveness to industry\nneeds. All VET providers who receive funding from the Victorian Government\nreport monthly to the Skills Victoria Training System (SVTS), which accepts\nand validates the providers' training activity data for payment, monitoring,\nreporting and related purposes.  DEECD analyses the providers' reported data\nin its production of the Victorian Training Market Reports.\nThe Reports summarise emerging trends in the Victorian training market and\nprovide a comparative overview of annual market changes.\nKey metrics in the Reports include training delivery by funding source,\nqualification level, training completions, employment status, higher needs\nlearners and region.  The Reports also analyse the responsiveness of training\ndelivery to specific occupational needs, industry and regional profiles.\nAll figures published in the Reports are generally rounded to the nearest 100.\nNB: The Victorian Training Market Reports are published quarterly. The data in\nthe first, second and third quarterly reports is considered preliminary and\nshould be treated as being indicative only.\nAll data supplied to Data VIC refers to activity reported and accepted by the\nSVTS system (data upload) for the Fourth Quarterly Report 2012. This 2012\nannual collection dataset was open for reporting purposes over 16 January 2012\nto 15 January 2013. The collection was closed and finalised on 16 January 2013\nand then subsequently informed the final 2012 Victorian Training Market\nReport.",

    "description": "This dataset includes City of Melbourne’s mapping of greening potential in laneways across the municipality. 'Greening' in this dataset refers to four types of possible greening responses: forest lanes, farm lanes, park lanes and vertical gardens. Higher gridcodes indicate lower potential for adaptation - i.e. a gridcode of 1 is optimal.\n\n\nThis dataset can be used the general public, developers, landscape architects and other interested parties who want to know what the future of green laneways may look like for Melbourne. This dataset can be used as a starting point for greening projects including forest, farm and park lanes as well as vertical gardens\n\n\nAnyone interested in potential greening within the city should contact the City of Melbourne or visit the Green Infrastructure webpages found on the  City of Melboune website here. The Growing Green Guide is another helpful and comprehensive guide for the building and maintaining green roofs, walls and facades in Melbourne and Victoria.\n\n\nThe Laneways with greening potential dataset is part of a larger suite of work by City of Melbourne to explore and implement contemporary and unique ways of greening in the city that can help combat increased urban density and loss of public open space. Green laneways are an exciting way to liven up the city, and help residents and visitors to explore Melbourne while also combating increasing threats of stormwater runoff, the urban heat island and biodiversity loss.",

    "description": "The Port Fairy Local Coastal Hazard Assessment (LCHA) provides information on the extent of coastal hazards and their physical impacts for the Port Fairy coastal environment.\n\nThis data considers setback of the present day shoreline due to coastal erosion if existing seawall (where present) remains in place. The four key components of coastal setback that are incorporated into this hazard line are: \n- S1, allowance for short term storm erosion (storm demand 100 year ARI); \n- S2, allowance for dune stability (zone of reduced foundation capacity); \n- S3, allowance for ongoing underlying recession; and, \n- S4, allowance for recession due to future sea level rise. \n\nThe total design setback (S) for three planning horizons comprises:\n- Present day: S = S1 + S2;\n- 2050: S = S1 + S2 + S3(2050) + S4(2050);\n- 2080: S = S1 + S2 + S3(2080) + S4(2080); and\n- 2100: S = S1 + S2 + S3(2100) + S4(2100).\n\nSea level rise projections utilised for the planning horizons were 0.4 m for 2050, 0.8 m for 2080 and 1.2 m for 2100 respectively. Where appropriate, the +6 m AHD contour was used as a reference as it was considered to represent the coastal alignment reasonably. The crest of the rock revetment was used as the reference contour on the southern half of East Beach. For low-lying dune systems the +2 m AHD contour was used.\n\nDetails of the assumptions made in the derivation of this information can be found in project reports on the Our Coast website: http://www.ourcoast.org.au/cb_pages/resources.php.\nUsers of this information should read these project reports to understand the limitations of the data.",

    "description": "The flood study carried out for the Griffith CBD catchment identifies flood liable properties for a range of design floods and finds approximately 168 properties that are flood liable during the 1% AEP event. \nThe Griffith CBD and upstream areas have experienced flooding in the past. This has been attributed to the insufficient capacity of the existing pipe drainage system, the flat topography across much of the area and the impediment to overland flow paths posed by the Main Branch Canal and the Temora-Roto Railway Line that passes to the immediate north of the CBD. In recognition of these flood issues, Griffith City Council (Council) have appointed WMAwater to carry out an Overland Flow Flood Study for the Griffith CBD catchment under the guidance of Council’s Floodplain Risk Management Committee.\nThe main objective of this study is to:\n\nDefine the overland flow flood behaviour within the Griffith CBD catchment over the full range of design flood events;\nDetail the number of properties at flood risk, extent of flood damage, and  provide Council with the technical basis to prepare a Floodplain Risk  Management Study &amp;  Plan;\nPrepare a modelling system suitable for use in the Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan, for assessing flood mitigation works; and\nProvide Council with a modelling tool for the pit and pipe drainage system.\n\nThe study has established suitable hydrologic and hydraulic modelling tools, demonstrated their capacity to emulate local flood behaviour via calibration/validation (as data allows) and then applied these tools to establish the existing flood risk for a range of design flood event probabilities in conjunction with a range of event durations.\nThis study has assessed major overland flow flooding throughout the Griffith CBD catchment in general and in the commercial areas in particular, providing Council with a sound understanding of the full range of potential flood risks and enabling Council to determine an optimum mix of works and measures to manage these risks.",

    "description": "This data was collected in November 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T04.\n\nDeparted: \tFremantle, WA,   Nov 10, 2011\nArrived:   \tHobart, TAS,   Nov 20, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "This key layer is the index to the input datasets collated into the estimated Pre-1750 (pre-clearing, pre-European) theme of the NVIS Version 5.1 dataset (from which the NVIS Major Vegetation Groups and Subgroups were derived).\n\nThe layer is intended to document and describe the input datasets and assist in dynamic analyses of data quality and gaps in the NVIS Pre-1750 theme dataset. Important information in the spatial feature class includes the dataset spatial extent (i.e. its \"footprint\"), dataset number and the source of the underlying dataset. Where more than one dataset have been combined within a region (mainly NSW & NT), a complex of footprints is the result.\n\nA lookup table provides important information, such as dataset title, scale and the on-ground range of dates of the vegetation survey. Attributes in the lookup table NVIS5_1_LUT_KEY_DSETn (from the NVIS DATASET and VERSION_USAGE Oracle tables, where n = an incremental number for minor version updates) need to be attached to this spatial data via DATA_SET_NUMBER. See metadata for this LUT for more details.This data has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

This assumes no change in vegetation type - just whether the type remains (i.e. hasn't been cleared). \n\nNo vector estimated pre-1750 layers are available for NSW and Tasmania. However, estimated pre-1750 layers have been developed under the Major Vegetation Group and Major Vegetation Subgroup products, using the same logic as above.\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment and Energy) 2018",

The noise filtered classification is the final product derived using SPOT 4/5 satellite imagery with Landsat 5 imagery used on small areas where cloud or where SPOT imagery coverage was unavailable. . The five of the eight classes have been labeled based on severity classes provided with the ground survey data. The remaining classes account for vegetation structures with no specific burn severity assigned. The area covered by the classification is approximately 460 by 300 km and is clipped to the extents of the fire effected lands (approximately 400 000 hectares).",

    "description": "This data set shows designated and actual irrigation areas in Australia\r\ncompiled by the National Land Use Mapping Project of the National Land and\r\nWater Resources Audit to assist in the identification of irrigation areas in\r\nAustralia. Additional data custodians include Agriculture WA, Queensland\r\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Mines, Murray-Darling Basin Commission,\r\nNew South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation and Tasmanian\r\nDepartment of Primary Industries, Water and Environment Designated irrigation\r\nareas indicate areas with administratively defined boundaries which have\r\nassociated rights and obligations pertaining to use of water for irrigation.\r\nThe precise meaning of the term designated irrigation area varies from\r\nregion to region. aActual irrigation areasa indicate areas with\r\nobservationally defined boundaries within which irrigation is practised. The\r\nboundaries have been supplied by various agencies and cover the more important\r\nirrigation areas in Australia. Users of this data set should be aware that\r\nthere are irrigated areas outside the designated and actual areas shown and\r\nthat there are non-irrigated areas inside them. This is particularly true of\r\nTasmania and the Murray-Darling Basin.The data set is available in both vector\r\nand raster formats. The raster data set can be used as a companion to the\r\n1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set which is also in raster format. Both\r\ndata sets have the same coordinate system, boundary coordinates and cell size\r\nso that they can easily be overlaid. Users may find, however, that some cells\r\nare classified as irrigated by the Australian Irrigation Areas data set and as\r\nnon-agricultural land by the 1996/97 Land Use of Australia data set.The\r\nVersion 1a data set may be of use to researchers and policy makers in need of\r\nnational, regional or local scale irrigation data, though the scale of the\r\nsource material is highly variable and completness of coverage is poor in\r\nsome regions.\r\n\r\nSee [further metadata](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_aia__r9ab\r\n__00211a02.xml) for more detail.\r\n\r\nLineage: The data set was constructed in vector format by appending irrigation area boundary data sets supplied by various agencies. The component data sets are listed below. One of the component data sets which was supplied as separate tiles in ArcView shapefile format was assembled into a single shapefile data set in ArcView 3.1. All other processing was carried out in ARC/INFO 7.2.1 under SunOS using double precision coordinates. For all operations in which processing used a fuzzy tolerance, the value specified was 0.00001 degrees (about 1 m). The raster form of the data set was made from the vector form. 1) Ord River Scheme, Stage 1, irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by Agriculture WA in ArcView shapefile format.2) Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland. This data set was supplied by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows designated irrigation areas. The coordinate datum is not known with certainty and was assumed to be the Australian Geodetic Datum 1984.3) Northern Murray-Darling Basin irrigation area boundaries. This data set was supplied by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in ARC/INFO export file format. It shows actual irrigation areas, based on interpretation of coarse scale imagery derived from Landsat TM images. The data set comprises 11 polygons. Of these, five have not been retained in the national data set because they largely coincide with the much higher resolution polygons of the Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. A sixth has not been retained because it proves to be almost entirely covered by a national park and a perennial lake. One of the polygons that was retained was edited to give precedence to a higher resolution polygon in the Boundary of Gazetted Irrigation Areas in Queensland data set which it partly overlies.4) Northern New South Wales Cotton Development data set. This data set was supplied by the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, in ArcView shapefile format, as 50 separate tiles. It shows actual irrigation areas and a variety of other land uses and land covers related to cotton growing. It is based on interpretation of aerial photography and satellite imagery with extensive field checking. Only the polygons showing irrigation areas were included in the national data set. The tiles were merged in ArcView using the merge function of the GeoProcessing Wizard. Further processing was undertaken in AR\r\n\r\n",
