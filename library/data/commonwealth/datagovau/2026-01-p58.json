    "title": "ABS - Personal Income - Total Income Distribution (SA3) 2017-2018",
    "description": "This dataset presents information about total income distribution. The data covers the financial year of 2017-2018, and is based on Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nTotal Income is the sum of all reported income derived from Employee income, Own unincorporated business, Superannuation, Investments and Other income. Total income does not include the non-lodger population.\nGovernment pensions, benefits or allowances are excluded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) income data and do not appear in Other income or Total income. Pension recipients can fall below the income threshold that necessitates them lodging a tax return, or they may only receive tax free pensions or allowances. Hence they will be missing from the personal income tax data set. Recent estimates from the ABS Survey of Income and Housing (which records Government pensions and allowances) suggest that this component can account for between 9% to 11% of Total income.\nAll monetary values are presented as gross pre-tax dollars, as far as possible. This means they reflect income before deductions and loses, and before any taxation or levies (e.g. the Medicare levy or the temporary budget repair levy) are applied. The amounts shown are nominal, they have not been adjusted for inflation. The income presented in this release has been categorised into income types, these categories have been devised by the ABS to closely align to ABS definitions of income.\nThe statistics in this release are compiled from the Linked Employer Employee Dataset (LEED), a cross-sectional database based on administrative data from the Australian taxation system. The LEED includes more than 120 million tax records over seven consecutive years between 2011-12 and 2017-18.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAll personal income tax statistics included in LEED were provided in de-identified form with no home address or date of birth. Addresses were coded to the ASGS and date of birth was converted to an age at 30 June of the reference year prior to data provision.\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, perturbation has been applied to the statistics in this release. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics, while maximising the range of information that can be released. These adjustments have a negligible impact on the underlying pattern of the statistics. Some cells have also been suppressed due to low counts.\n\n\nTotals may not align with the sum of their components due to missing or unpublished information in the underlying data and perturbation.\n\n\nFor further information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nAURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n\n\nSpatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSet 'np' (not published to protect the confidentiality of individuals or businesses) values to Null.\n\n",

    "description": "Long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) is a regulatory limit set on annual water extractions from a river system. It ensures that average extractions over the long term are sustainable, and thus help prevent environmental degradation.\n\nIn NSW these limits are defined by water sharing plans (WSPs). Every WSP outlines how the water in a river system will be shared over a 10-year period. They also define:\n\n• how LTAAEL compliance is to be assessed for each river system\n\n• what conditions will trigger noncompliance action\n\n• what compliance action can be taken.\n\nThe Natural Resources Commission regularly reviews all WSPs to ensure extractions from each river system are within the limits set, and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority reviews sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliance each year.\n\nTo assess compliance, we model LTAAEL using a model that has been configured to represent the development and management rules defined by a system WSP (this refers to as LTAAEL model). We then compare this modelled LTAAEL with the modelled under current conditions long-term average annual extractions (LTAAEs) (which are usually those modelled by the annual permitted take, or APT, model). Although, the LTAAEL includes multiple types of water use, the compliance assessment is based on the total. We do this annually using the best available models, and the outcomes are published on the DPE website.\n\nWhere river system’s LTAAE exceed LTAAEL, the system is considered noncompliant. If the noncompliance trigger conditions in the WSP are met, noncompliance action is taken.\n\nThe data set provided contains flows at several gauges in each river system, as simulated by the annually extended LTAAEL model. Notwithstanding the model’s inherent limitations, these are a fair representation of those we would expect under WSP operation and development conditions. They can be compared with flows simulated by other key scenario models, such as annual permitted take (APT) model or without development (WOD) model.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated data regarding employee jobs and median employee income per job, classified by industry subdivision at Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4). The data spans over the 2013-14 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 SA4 boundaries.\nJobs in Australia provide aggregate statistics and are sourced from the Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. An 'employee Job' refers to a job for which the occupant receives remuneration in wages, salary, payment in kind, or piece rates. This excludes self-employment jobs held by Owner-Managers of Unincorporated Enterprises (OMUE).\nThe job counts in this release differ from the filled job estimates from other sources such as the Australian Labour Account and the Labour Force Australia. The Jobs in Australia release provides insights into all jobs held throughout the year, while the Labour Account data provides the number of filled jobs at a point-in-time each quarter (and annually for the financial year reference period), and Labour Force Survey data measures the number of people employed each month. \nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThis release provides statistics on the number and nature of jobs, the people who hold them, and their employers. These statistics can be used to understand regional labour markets or to identify the impact of major changes in local communities. The release also provides new insights into the number of jobs people hold, the duration of jobs, and the industries and employment income of concurrent jobs.\nThe scope of these data includes individuals who submitted an individual tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), individuals who had a Pay As You Go (PAYG) payment summary issued by an employer and their employers.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

Response times are an important measure of the service we provide, but are only one of a number of measures used to gauge the effective\ndelivery of an ambulance service. \nOur response times are measured from the receipt of the triple zero (000) call until paramedics arrive on scene. Response times are\ninfluenced by many factors including traffic, distance required to travel, availability of ambulances and demand for our services. \nWe designate those patients that require urgent paramedic and hospital care as \"Code 1,\" and these patients receive a \"lights and sirens\"\nresponse. The tables provide information about our Code 1 response time performance by both Local Government Area (LGA) and Urban Centres and Localities (UCL). Code 2 incidents are acute, but not time critical and do not require a lights and sirens response. AV's average Code 2 response time\nperformance has also been provided. \nAs part of our process of continual improvement, the response time performance shown below has been calculated using data sourced from\nthe Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system used across Victoria.  UCLs : These are geographical areas based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nUrban Centres and Localities (UCLs) boundaries and residential population.\nAmbulance Victoria reports performance for larger UCLs where population\nexceeds 7,500 persons.",

The bores penetrated the Four Mile Creek beds and the Buttai Sandstone of the Tomago \"Stage\" of the \"Upper\" Coal Measures. In the absence of reliable stratigraphical control, the seams cannot be correlated with much certainty. Bore BMR 4 Stony Punch indicated that Donaldson's Seam(?) is thin and much banded; the coal, excluding bands, has an ash content of about 15% and calorific value of 12,300 B.Th.U/lb. This same bore showed that the basal 7 feet 3 inches of the Big Ben Seam had an ash content of about 25% and calorific value of 10,600 B.Th.U/lb. if 8 inches of non-coal bands are excluded. The general results of the drilling were that the coal seams were heavily banded, variable and high in inherent ash. Accordingly the prospecting was halted after drilling six holes.",

The location of the client is based on their place of usual residence. The data spans the financial years between 2014-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). \nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) - National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), which is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient care data collection systems in Australian hospitals in each state and territory. The NHMD is based on data provided to the AIHW by state and territory health authorities for the National minimum data set (NMDS) for Admitted patient care.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Indigenous Eye Health Measures 2017 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nThe data are crude rates.\n\n\nData by PHN should be interpreted with caution due to variations in admission practices, and because patients may be hospitalised outside the PHN where they reside.\n\n\nAlmost all (96%) cataract surgery in Australia is undertaken on a same-day basis. The data may underestimate the number of procedures provided as they do not include those undertaken on an outpatient basis.\n\n\nThe quality of data provided for Indigenous status varies.

    "description": "This dataset shows the footprints of all structures within the City of Melbourne. A building footprint is a 2D polygon (or multi-polygon) representation of the base of a building or structure. The footprint is defined as the boundary of the structure where the walls intersect with the ground plane or podium, rather than an outline of the roof area (roofprint).\n\nWhere a building has a significant change in built form, multiple footprint polygons are ‘stacked’ vertically to define shape of the built form. This includes, and is not limited to:\n\n- Tower\n- Podium\n- Setbacks/offsets\n\nTo see the footprints in 3D please refer to our Development Activity Model  \n\nThe Australian Height Datum (AHD) is the national vertical datum for Australia. The National Mapping Council adopted the AHD in May 1971 as the datum to which all vertical control mapping would be referred\n\nThe data was captured in May 2018.",

The statistics include all approved residential building valued at $10,000 or more and all approved non-residential building valued at $50,000 or more.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data from the ABS.\n\n\nThe data has been sourced from the June 2015 release.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

The data spans the months of 2017 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n",

    "description": "As part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018) the Melbourne Water operating region was split into a series of sub-regions. This includes 5 catchments, and 69 sub-catchments. The boundaries of each region generally follow catchment boundaries. There are two separate spatial scales:- Catchments (5 regions: Werribee, Maribyrnong, Yarra, Dandenong, Westernport) and Sub-catchments (69 polygons). This dataset is an update to the Regional River Health Strategy (RRHS) Management Units layer created in 2008. Primary purpose of this data is for reporting of targets, performance objectives, conditions, values etc. relating to the Healthy Waterways Strategy.\n\n\n\nThe sub-catchments in this dataset are an update of the &quot;management units&quot; developed for the Regional River Health Strategy in 2008. This dataset was created by merging sub-catchments from the University of Melbourne sub-catchments layer, commonly referred to as the DCI layer (where DCI refers to Directly Connected Imperviousness). The catchment polygons in this layer are similar to, but not exactly the same as those in the DCI layer currently used internally at Melbourne Water - The internally used layer has 15,901 polygon catchments, whilst the layer used to create this dataset has 16,346 polygon catchments. The Melbourne Water internal dataset will shortly be updated to align.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data. Any person or group that uses this data does so at its own risk and should make their own assessment and investigations as to the suitability and/or application of the data. Melbourne Water Corporation shall not be liable in any way to any person or group for loss of any kind including damages, costs, interest, loss of profits or special loss or damage, arising from any use, error, inaccuracy, incompleteness or other defect in this data.",

    "description": "A unique relationship exists between neighbouring males and females in the fiddler crab Uca capricornis. This experiment was designed to demonstrate how a male fiddler crab responds to different individuals tethered near to his burrow. The response of a male crab to the neighbour and a stranger (with similar physical characteristics) was observed. The trial ended when the focal male touched the tethered individual (approach), or after 5 minutes passed with no approach (ignore). The order of the two trials (neighbour or stranger) was random. 80 experiments were conducted in total, 20 of each of the following combinations: i) male -- neighbouring male, ii) male -- strange male, iii) male -- neighbouring female, iv) male -- strange female. \n\nThe results indicate that males treat female neighbours differently to male neighbours and intruders (of either sex). They were less likely to approach a female neighbour than an unknown female tethered in the same spot. They were equally likely to approach an unknown female, a neighbouring male and an unknown male.",

    "description": "<strong>What is the NSW Habitat Link Value (HLV) Index?</strong>\n\nThe NSW Habitat Link Value (HLV) Index estimates the relative contribution each location across NSW makes to terrestrial habitat connectivity across multiple ecological scales. The HLV Index, when mapped, provides a visualisation of a region's connectivity network. A high HLV indicates that the area may function as an important corridor for a range of species movements and ecological processes such as foraging, dispersal and migration. Since the relative contribution a location makes to habitat connectivity can increase when habitat is lost elsewhere, an increase in HLV does not necessarily indicate an improvement in habitat connectivity. Therefore, the HLV Index should not be used to measure how well-connected habitat is at any location or within a region. The related <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-nhi-index\">NSW Neighbourhood Intactness (NHI) Index</a> is best suited to this purpose. The NSW HLV Index is a multi-scale application of the habitat link value (Li) analysis along with the related neighbourhood habitat area (Ni) that underpins the NSW NHI index.\n\n<strong>How are the data created?</strong>\n\nThe NSW HLV Index is created using the NSW Habitat Intactness (HI) Index as an input to a multi-scale habitat link value (Li) analysis. Least cost paths between good condition habitats are mapped at different spatial resolutions then averaged at each 90 x 90m pixel location to measure its contribution to habitat connectivity generalised across a range of ecological scales. The NSW HI Index combines direct measures of remotely sensed vegetation cover with measures inferred from other data sources using expert input to estimate terrestrial habitat intactness (See the <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-habitat-intactness-index\">NSW HI Index Information Sheet</a> for further details).  \n\n<strong>What data are available?</strong>\n\nData are initially available annually from 2017, currently with a two-year time lag for the most recent layer due to the availability of NSW Habitat Intactness inputs. Data for other periods may be generated as needed. Layers provide near-complete statewide coverage but are limited by the NSW Habitat Intactness inputs available at the time of each assessment, and their accuracy, currency and completeness.\n\nData details:   \n<ul>\n<li>Data type: raster, GeoTIFF, 32bit floating point</li>\n<li>CRS: EPSG:3577 - GDA94 / Australian Albers </li>\n<li>Pixel size: 90 x 90m</li>\n<li>Pixel values: 0.0 (lowest HLV) to 1.0 (highest HLV)</li>\n<li>Null value: -9999</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What can the data be used for?</strong>\n\nThe NSW Habitat Link Value has been used to map ecological connectivity (<a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/integrated-model-data-fusion-approach-measuring-habitat-condition-ecological-integrity-reporting\">Love et al. 2020</a>) and provides a visualisation of a region's connectivity network. This mapping can be used to inform the connectivity strategy (priorities for improving the persistence of biodiversity) by highlighting opportunities for conserving, enhancing and building important habitat networks between concentrations of high-quality habitat. Connectivity can be mapped across structurally distinct habitat types and at various spatial resolutions, for jurisdictional reporting, and in the context of climate-induced shifts to environmental niches (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380021003963?via%3Dihub\">Drielsma et al. 2022</a>). The HLV can be contextualised with additional sources of information to identify preferred habitat corridors for different contexts.   ",

    "description": "Urban Habitat Connectivity Project (UHCP)\n\nShort description: A package of data containing potential habitat and fragmentation for seven species groups in the urban ACT. Each species group has two layer files. Connected habitat layers show potential core and corridor habitat for the species group, and connectivity/fragmentation between these habitat patches. Remnant patches layers contain areas which are predicted to be fragmented and inaccessible for the species group, but may be important for restoration activities. These layers are outputs of ecological connectivity modelling and have been developed using spatial data representing habitat and connectivity requirements specific to the species group.\n\nThe following attributes are available in the data table for Connected Habitat layers:\n\n\n<ul><li>Species Group* - indicates the species group of interest</li><li>Patch ID – a unique identifier for each ‘patch’ of connected habitat, an ID that is given to group all habitat areas which are predicted to be connected to each other.</li><li>Habitat Type* – identifies if the polygon meets core or corridor habitat requirements, or if it is a remnant patch.</li><li>Habitat Number – a numeric value linked to Habitat Type to support statistics and symbology. Core habitat has a value of 0 and corridor habitat has a value of 1.</li><li>Patch Area (Ha)* – the area of the individual polygon in hectares.</li><li>Connected Habitat Area (Ha) – the total area of potential habitat in the connected patch, determined by summing the Patch Area for all polygons with the same Patch ID.</li><li>Shape area – the polygon’s area, calculated by default in meters squared.</li><li>Shape length – the length of the line enclosing the polygon, calculated by default in meters squared.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n* Is also available in the data table for Remnant Patches layers.\n\nSpatial resolution: 1:10,000\n\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\n\nMETHODS\n\nData collection / creation: <a>Spatial layers for habitat and barriers were created and input into a habitat connectivity/fragmentation model specifically designed for the species group. The model was developed using metrics derived from expert elicitation. These metrics quantified essential habitat and connectivity requirements for the species group, for example the preferred spacing of trees, the maximum crossable width of a road, the typical dispersal distance, etc. </a>The model identified habitat and barriers to connectivity, based on the metrics which could be mapped. Habitat was delineated by patch size to determine core and corridor habitat, and to remove areas which are too small to be functional. The habitat type is visible in the attribute table of the data.\n\nConnectivity between habitat patches is dependent on the species group’s dispersal capacity and the availability of core habitat, suitable corridors and a path without barriers. To assess this core habitat areas were buffered by the species group’s dispersal distance. This identified how far an individual will move to find a new core habitat patch. Movement to this distance is dependent on a suitable path. All habitat was buffered by the distance the species can move outside habitat (through non-habitat areas). This identified how far an individual will move outside any habitat (core or corridor) before they require another habitat patch (i.e. how far they can travel between stepping stones).Connectivity is further complicated by impassable barriers. Barriers were used to slice up the dispersal buffers and identify ‘dispersal patches’, areas which an individual can move within. Fragmentation is seen when a barrier is present, patches are too far from core habitat, or corridor habitat is too far apart.\n\nA unique ID was applied to each patch and represents connectivity/fragmentation. The patches were intersected with habitat to apply the new ID to the habitat areas. The final model outputs identify areas of potential core, corridor or remnant (inaccessible) habitat. Core and corridor habitat are viewable in the connected habitat dataset, whilst remnant patches are available separately. The data was simplified using the Douglas-Peuker algorithm, a tolerance of 0.5-2m, minimum size of 2-5m2 for retention, and holes filled in if less than 20m2. Small adjoining slithers &lt;20m2 were dissolved into neighbouring polygons to optimise drawing speeds. Please contact the project team for the model script or further details on the methodology.\n\nNOTES ON USE\n\nQuality: The habitat connectivity modelling used to produce the data was informed by work by the City of Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331035992_Linking_Nature_in_the_City_A_framework_for_improving_ecological_connectivity_across_the_City_of_Melbourne\">(Kirk et al., 2018)</a>. The original methods were expanded on, with habitat and connectivity requirements (metrics) specific to the species group determined from expert elicitation and further analysis to consider patch size for core or corridor patches. The expert elicitation process provided the best and most relevant quantitative description of habitat and barriers available (for a species group rather than a specific species). The input datasets were then tailored to the metrics for this project. Existing datasets were refined to be relevant and reflect the metrics identified through expert elicitation. New datasets were created where data was missing. All data was derived from existing authoritative sources and/or remotely sensed data. This data curation process ensured the input datasets, and resulting output, were relevant and fit for purpose.\n\nLimitations: This data should be considered indicative only as there are limitations to the modelling process. It considers all habitat and barriers equally and as discrete objects (i.e. it applies a discrete boundary around a patch and does not account for gradients or flexible boundaries).The model predicts habitat and connectivity based on the data available. It does not assess whether a species is present or consider temporal variability. Some habitat requirements are not mapped (e.g. native vegetation, lack of predators) due to the lack of an accurate or complete dataset. Some of these requirements are critical to the success of the species group. These habitat requirements are available and have been derived from expert elicitation. They should be considered at an area of interest.\n\nThe model assumes the input data is up to date and accurate. Many of the habitat and barrier datasets used as inputs into the models are in some way informed by remote sensing data. Remote sensing data has limitations, such as potential for misclassification (e.g. bare ground and pavement could be confused). Additionally, remotely sensed data captures a point in time and will become outdated. Manual checks and improvements using supplementary data for specific sites have been completed to reduce as much error as possible.\n\nData refinement: Unmapped habitat and connectivity requirements should be considered when using the data. The full list of known habitat and connectivity requirements for each species group, including those considered by the model and those unaccounted for, is available by request. Other data may also be used to track changes post-LiDAR capture. For example, new development footprints may be used to remove non-habitat areas and can be done so at a faster rate than waiting for new LiDAR captures and re-running the model.\n\n\n\nSHARING\n\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\n\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

The data is based on the recipient's geocoded address aggregated by Local Government Area (LGA) from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2014.\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) is the Australian Government's lead agency in the development and delivery of social policy, and is working to improve the lifetime wellbeing of people and families in Australia. DSS' policies and services respond to need across people's lives - looking after families, children and older people; providing a safety net for people who cannot fully support themselves; enhancing the wellbeing of people with high needs; assisting people who need help with care; and supporting a diverse and harmonious society. DSS supports people and families in Australia by encouraging independence and participation, and supporting a cohesive society.\nFor more information on this dataset please visit the Australian Government Open Data.\nFor further details on payments, see 'A guide to Australian Government payments'.\nPlease note:\n\n\nIn order to protect individuals' privacy, identified populations between 1 and 4 have been suppressed and replaced with '&lt;5' for confidentiality purposes. Additional data may be suppressed and replaced with 'n.p.' (not provided) to prevent the derivation of identified populations that have values of less than 5.\n\n\nIndividuals who live overseas, individuals who are without a valid home address and individuals who only have a postal address cannot be assigned to a locational boundary. State/territory totals derived from Local Government Area data will not match actual state and territory totals, due to different statistical geography methodologies.\n\n\nCaveats specific to payments type can be found in the relevant payment description of the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has spatialised this dataset and have made the following replacements to enforce data type consistency: \n\n\n'&lt;5' has been assigned a value of '-1' within the data\n\n\nA boolean field has been created for each data field to flag left-censored data. 'True' is assigned to fields that have been censored.\n\n\n'n.p.' (not provided) has been set to Null within the data.\n\n",

    "description": "The _Survey of Trust in Australian public services_ is a regular, national survey measuring public satisfaction, trust and experiences with Australian public services. This dataset provides trust, satisfaction and experience Survey results across a variety of indicators. The Survey was previously called the Citizen Experience Survey. \r\n\r\nAs of June 2022, more than 43,000 people, aged 18 years and over, have participated in the Survey. Between March 2019 and June 2021, eight survey waves, each surveying approximately 2,500-5,000 people, were conducted. Since July 2021, twelve additional waves of approximately 1,000 people each month have been conducted and analysed. Continued regular data collection has enabled creation of a reliable time series of data.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Survey ensures people reflect on their experiences with Australian public services (also known as Commonwealth, Federal or National public services) and not state, territory or local public services, or Government or policy.\r\n \r\nParticipation in the Survey is voluntary and information collected is anonymous and de-identified. The Survey is nationally representative of age, state/territory and gender. Survey participants consent to the publication of results in aggregate. \r\n\r\nWhen reporting Trust in Australian public services data, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet must be attributed as the source. \r\n \r\nAdditional detail on the Survey is available on the APS Reform website at https://www.apsreform.gov.au/trustsurvey and at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet website at https://www.pmc.gov.au ",

    "description": "Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) including heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capability indicators were created for whole Australia.The dataset supports the development of a national heat vulnerability assessment toolkit for Australia, designed to identify areas and populations most susceptible to heat-related risks. The project addresses the growing need for understanding the relationship between urbanization, land surface temperature (LST), and the urban heat island effect, particularly for vulnerable communities. Integrating satellite-derived environmental data (LST, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) with socioeconomic data, this toolkit provides a comprehensive resource for building heat-resilient cities and suburbs.\nThis dataset includes both raw environmental data for the 2020-2021 Australian summer (November to March) and a calculated Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) aggregated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygon dataset. The HVI, based on the IPCC's vulnerability conceptual framework, is a composite index comprised of three core components: heat exposure (derived from LST), sensitivity to heat (influenced by socioeconomic factors), and adaptive capability. Each SA1 is assigned a vulnerability rating ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no population and 5 representing high vulnerability, based on the aggregated indicator scores and quartile distribution.\nThe methodology employs Google Earth Engine (GEE) to derive LST, NDBI, and NDVI.  The HVI, along with its components, allows for spatial analysis and facilitates understanding of the complex relationships between heat, environmental factors, and socioeconomic conditions, enabling targeted policy and decision-making at local levels. This work aims to support dynamic and interactive vulnerability assessment, enabling users to update and construct their own indicators and indices for diverse applications.\nDetailed methodology for HVI generation can be found in this paper. Additional resources are available on the project's GitHub repository, the web application, and the toolkit.",

Also throughout the dredging program aerial surveys of the dredging location, monitoring locations and surrounding areas were undertaken on a weekly basis.  They were flown of the same day as the water monitoring trip to allow for cross-referencing of visual observations and actual data.",

    "description": "The stand condition of river red gums, black box and coolibah have been identified as objectives to measure the progress towards achieving outcomes of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) commissioned a spatial stand condition assessment tool of these trees in 2014. The tool defined the extent of these communities by using a predictive model based on existing vegetation mapping and an analysis of satellite images. \r\nThe assessment tool involves a combination of quantitative ground surveys, remote sensing and modelling using machine learning. The ground surveys record the percentage of live leaf area, plant area index and crown extent. These parameters have been identified as being reliable and objective indicators of stand condition in floodplain forests.\r\n\r\nThe assessment tool was backdated to 2009, and then updated every year up to 2016 using Landsat 8 imagery. The assessment was not completed for 2011 and 2013 due to corrupt Landsat 7 imagery and flooding preventing completion of fieldwork.\r\n\r\nThe MDBA has made the assessment tool related resources publicly available as part of its commitment to the Australian Government policy on public data and information. Due to the large file size, the following files are not uploaded to www.data.gov.au but are available on request from gis@mdba.gov.au. \r\n\r\n   •\tStand Condition Assessment tool - Stand Condition Assessment tool software (.exe; 299MB)\r\n\r\n   •\tInput Data - six epochs of 2009, 2010, 2012-2016 and Landsat time composite images (floating point raster image)\r\n\r\n   •\t Output data - Stand condition time series shapefiles (six epochs between 2009-2016) for red gum, black box and coolibah (geodatabase of shape files; 990MB)\r\n\r\n   •\tOutput data - four bands Landsat stand condition output image with bands one to four contains crown extent, plant area index, live basal area and condition score respectively (floating point raster image; 331GB – approximately 50GB per epoch).\r\n\r\nThe Terms and conditions for using the data and related resources from this website can be found at https://www.data.gov.au/about.",

The data spans over the 2017-18 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 SA2 boundaries.\nJobs in Australia provide aggregate statistics and are sourced from the Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. An 'employee Job' refers to a job for which the occupant receives remuneration in wages, salary, payment in kind, or piece rates. This excludes self-employment jobs held by Owner-Managers of Unincorporated Enterprises (OMUE).\nThe job counts in this release differ from the filled job estimates from other sources such as the Australian Labour Account and the Labour Force Australia. The Jobs in Australia release provides insights into all jobs held throughout the year, while the Labour Account data provides the number of filled jobs at a point-in-time each quarter (and annually for the financial year reference period), and Labour Force Survey data measures the number of people employed each month. \nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThis release provides statistics on the number and nature of jobs, the people who hold them, and their employers. These statistics can be used to understand regional labour markets or to identify the impact of major changes in local communities. The release also provides new insights into the number of jobs people hold, the duration of jobs, and the industries and employment income of concurrent jobs.\nThe scope of these data includes individuals who submitted an individual tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), individuals who had a Pay As You Go (PAYG) payment summary issued by an employer and their employers.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

    "description": "The Mobile Network Hardening Program (MNHP) is an Australian Government initiative that assists the mobile network operators, infrastructure providers and infrastructure managers to improve the resilience of Australia's regional mobile network telecommunications infrastructure to:\r\n\r\n* prevent outages in the event of a Natural Disaster;\r\n* strengthen the resilience of telecommunications facilities to allow them to operate for longer during bushfires and other Natural Disasters; and/or\r\n* enable the rapid restoration of services following an outage.\r\n\r\nRound 1 of the MNHP was funded through the Government's Strengthening Telecommunications Against Natural Disasters Initiative, announced in January 2020. Round 1 is providing $23.5 million (GST inclusive) in funding to Optus, Telstra and TPG the mobile network operators across two stages to deliver approximately 1,000 projects to strengthen the resilience of regional telecommunications infrastructure. \r\n \r\nThe first stage is funding Optus, Telstra and TPG to enhance the battery backup power at 466 base stations funded under the first two rounds of the Government's Mobile Black Spot Program. These upgrades will increase backup operation at these base stations to at least 12 hours. \r\n \r\nThe second stage is funding Optus, Telstra and TPG to deliver over 530 resilience upgrades at mobile base station sites across Australia including the deployment of new portable and permanent generators to supply additional back-up power during power outages, the improvement of transmission resilience within regional mobile network clusters to reduce single points of network failure and addition and upgrades to battery systems.\r\n \r\nFor more information about the MNHP go to https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/mnhp",

It can be easily mapped using the geometry column. \n\nTree canopy polygons have been derived by ArborCarbon from high-resolution airborne multispectral imagery. ArborCarbon collected this imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. \n\nThe high-resolution airborne imagery datasets were geometrically corrected and orthorectified using the City of Melbourne’s publicly available 2018 aerial imagery and a Digital Terrain Model supplied by the City. A Digital Surface Model was generated from the acquired imagery for the full extent of the City, enabling the stratification of vegetation into a range of height categories. All vegetation &gt;3m above the ground was classified as canopy (excluding vegetation on building rooftops).",

    "description": "This dataset presents the total number of distinct specialist homeless services clients. The client counts are based on the location where the client resided in the week before their first support period in the financial year. Each client contributes only once, even if they had multiple support periods during the financial year. The data spans the financial years of 2014-15 to 2018-19 and is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4).\nThe Specialist Homelessness Services Collection (SHSC) data accompanies the Specialist Homelessness Services Annual Report 2018-19.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - SHSC Data Cubes User Guide.\nNotes:\n\n\nCaution should be used when comparing data for 2017-18 onwards with data for 2014-15 to 2016-17 in sub-state data cubes. Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017–18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.\n\n\nClients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).\n\n\nClients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.",

This is indicated in one of the fields in the data file. Data comes from TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-1/2 up until about June, 2003. After that data comes from the follow-on missions - Jason-1 and Envisat. The data is on a 1 degree Mercator grid - the longitude grid spacing is always 1 degree. The latitude grid spacing is 1 degree at the equator, but gets smaller with distance from the equator. This data set is in a relatively easy to use format. The data was provided by Aviso/CNES in France and has been reformatted into a netCDF file at CSIRO Marine Research in Hobart.

    "description": "A gravity core (GC12) was collected from a depth of 990.5 mbsl within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Analysis of other parameters revealed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sitting at a depth of ~175cm into the core. Four samples were collected for X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; the top two, at the sediment surface (GC12-0) and at 30cm (GC12-30) represent interglacial sediment, while the lower two, at 210cm (GC12-210) and 330cm (GC12-330) represent glacial sediment. XRD analysis suggests that the majority of the carbonate is calcite during the interglacials, primarily from pelagic carbonate production. During the glacials and transitions more quartz, feldspar, aragonite and Mg calcite are present. This suggests that there is a changing dominance of pelagic, terrigenous and reef platform material within the core related to sea-level variations.",

    "description": "This dataset presents aggregated data regarding the number of people employed in multiple jobs and their respective median income by the relevant statistical regions. The data spans from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) boundaries.\nJobs in Australia is a new release that provides aggregate statistics from the recently developed Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers.\nJobs in Australia describes all job relationships accumulated over the course of a year. This means that job counts in this publication are higher than the estimates of filled jobs published in the quarterly Australian Labour Account, which provides a point-in-time, or stock measure. These statistics about jobs also differ from Labour Force Survey statistics, which estimate the number of people who held a job in each month.\nThis data is Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data (catalogue number: 6160.0) used with permission from the ABS.\nFor more information on the release please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nThe purpose of this publication is to provide new information about the number and nature of filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. It includes information about multiple job-holding and employment in local areas. Jobs in Australia counts all jobs held during the reference year. This complements and expands on quarterly stock estimates of filled jobs presented in the Australian Labour Account.\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data. The following additional changes were made:\n\n\nWhere data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.\n\n\nTotal values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.\n\n",

    "title": "An atlas of the lakes of the Larsemann Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica - ANARE Research Notes 74",
    "description": "From the abstract of the ANARE Research Note:\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills are a series of granite and gneiss peninsulas extending into Prydz Bay, between the Amery Ice Shelf and the Sorsdal Glacier.  They are dissected by steep-sided valleys produced by at least two glacial stages in the Holocene.  There are over 150 freshwater lakes in the hills, ranging from small ponds less than 1 m deep, to glacial lakes up to 10 ha and 38 m deep.  The lakes are young, with the oldest basins being about 9000 years old. Variations in the characteristics of the lakes reflect deglaciation history, proximity to the continental ice margin and exposure to the ocean.  The main source of the water is snow melt, augmented by sea spray into the more exposed lakes.  The waters are well mixed by katabatic winds.  Most lakes thaw for up to 2 months in summer, but some are permanently frozen.\r\n\r\nThe waters have mainly low conductivity and exceptionally low turbidity, and have near-neutral pH values.  The ionic order is Na+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than K+.  This reflects a strong marine influence, with calcium dominating in a very few catchments.\r\n\r\nThe Larsemann Hills were discovered in 1935 by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen in the Thorshavn.  Australian, Chinese and Russian stations were established in the area in the mid-late 1980's.  Law (Australia) was commenced in 1986 when an Apple Hut was unloaded from MV Nella Dan.  A subsequent visit was made during the 1986 winter.  The first Australian scientific expedition visited the area during the 1986-87 austral summer.  Progress Station (Russia) was occupied at the time.  Building of Zhong Shan commenced in January 1989.\r\n\r\n*******************\r\n\r\nSeveral files are associated with this metadata record:\r\n\r\n1) A PDF copy of the original ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n2) A CSV file containing the data presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\n3) A shapefile of the lakes presented in the ANARE Research Note\r\n\r\nThe fields in this dataset are:\r\n\r\nlake_id\r\n\r\nlake_name (text)\r\n\r\nlocation (text description)\r\n\r\nlongitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\nlatitude (decimal degrees)\r\n\r\naltitude (m)\r\n\r\nlake_area (ha)\r\n\r\ncatchment_area (ha)\r\n\r\nmaximum_depth (m)\r\n\r\ndimensions (m)\r\n\r\ndistance_from_polar_plateau (m)\r\n\r\ndescription (text)\r\n\r\ngeology (text)\r\n\r\nwater_temperature (C)\r\n\r\npH\r\n\r\nwater_conductivity (micro mho/cm)\r\n\r\nEh (reduction potential, mV)\r\n\r\nca_concentration (Ca++, ppm)\r\n\r\nmg_concentration (Mg++, ppm)\r\n\r\nna_concentration (NA+, ppm)\r\n\r\nk_concentration (K+, ppm)\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_na_ca_mg_k (ionic ratio of na:(ca+mg+mk))\r\n\r\nionic_ratios_ca_na_k_mg (ionic ratio of ca:(na+k+mg))\r\n\r\nbottom_sediment_grab_sample (text description of results)\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Modified Monash Model (MMM)\r\n\r\nThe Modified Monash Model (MMM) is a classification system used to define the remoteness of Australian locations, ranging from MM 1 (major cities) to MM 7 (very remote areas). It combines population size and geographic remoteness to guide health workforce planning, especially in rural and remote communities. MMM is based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard – Remoteness Areas (ASGS-RA) and is updated after each national Census conducted by the ABS.\r\n\r\nStatistical Area Level 1 (SA1)\r\n\r\nSA1s are geographic units used in the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), designed to provide detailed Census data. Built from Mesh Blocks, SA1s aggregate into SA2s and serve as foundational units for various statistical structures, including urban and Indigenous classifications. There are 61,845 SA1s across Australia, including special codes for populations without fixed addresses, such as those in transit or with no usual residence.\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents information from 2016 at the household level; the percentage of households within each Index of Household Advantage and Disadvantage (IHAD) quartile for Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) 2016 boundaries.\nThe IHAD is an experimental analytical index developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that provides a summary measure of relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage for households. It utilises information from the 2016 Census of Population and Housing.\nIHAD quartiles: All households are ordered from lowest to highest disadvantage, the lowest 25% of households are given a quartile number of 1, the next lowest 25% of households are given a quartile number of 2 and so on, up to the highest 25% of households which are given a quartile number of 4. This means that households are divided up into four groups, depending on their score.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 4198.0) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nPlease note: \n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAURIN has calculated the number of households for each IHAD quartile based on the Occupied Private Dwellings count and the percentage of households in each quartile. These calculated columns have been appended to the original dataset.\n\n\nA household is defined as one or more persons, at least one of whom is at least 15 years of age, usually resident in the same private dwelling. All occupants of a dwelling form a household. For Census purposes, the total number of households is equal to the total number of occupied private dwellings (Census of Population and Housing: Census Dictionary, 2016 cat. no. 2901.0).\n\n\nIHAD output has been confidentialised to meet ABS requirements. In line with standard ABS procedures to minimise the risk of identifying individuals, a technique has been applied to randomly adjust cell values of the output tables.  These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset is one of seven point-level samples (covering NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, WA, NT, and SA) from the Ambient National Transport Noise data for 2018/2019. Instructions for applying for a quote to obtain the full dataset are provided below.\nAmbient has developed a comprehensive national transport noise map, offering valuable insights for home buyers, investors, researchers, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals working in community well-being and transportation. This dataset provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the impacts of noise on urban environments, supporting informed decision-making in various fields.\nThe full dataset offers two main components, providing comprehensive noise levels with breakdowns by time of day (day, evening, night) and exposure levels (maximum and minimum):\nVector Data (Transport Noise Dataset Buildings):\nBuilding-level day and night noise data based on Geoscape Building Footprint (as points) data for individual noise sources: road, rail, and aircraft. The attribute data for each building captured the highest (most exposed) and lowest (least exposed) noise level across all facades of all storeys. The dataset attempted to model all roads and rail lines, based on the data available. For airlines, modelling was based on actual aircraft movements captured over two periods of around two weeks. If aircraft did not flight a specific route at that time, that route will not appear in the noise levels.\nRaster Data (Transport Noise Overlay):\nRaster representations of noise data provide a broad overview of noise distribution across areas. These include separate representations for road, rail, and aircraft noise, during both day and night, with raster resolutions ranging from 10x10m to 50x50m.\nA detailed explanation of the attributes and their values can be found below. More information about the data product can be found at https://www.ambientmaps.com.au/.\nThis sample dataset covers a single Level 2 Statistical Area (SA2) area for the vector data, Melbourne CBD - East in VIC with SA2 code 206041503, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It serves as a representative example of the full dataset's capabilities. The complete coverage for the full dataset encompasses all of the five states.\nResearchers and professionals interested in accessing the full data beyond this sample SA2 are encouraged to request a quote from AURIN: https://aurin.org.au/resources/data/ambient-maps-data/ for the full dataset. The complete offering provides a more extensive and detailed analysis, enabling in-depth studies and comprehensive urban planning initiatives.\nBy exploring this sample dataset, users can gain insights into the potential applications and value of the full Ambient Maps Noise Mapping Dataset, supporting their decision-making process for acquiring the complete data offering.\nSample data attribute explanation:\nSP = SoundPLAN – denoting these decibel (dB) values are straight out of SoundPLAN, uncorrected in any way.\nRD = Road noise\nRL = Rail noise from all rail sources. There is also HR and TR which separates Heavy Rail and Trams.\nD, E, N is day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm), and night (11pm to 7am) time periods.\nAircraft_DE and Aircraft_N should have an SP at the start, and present all aircraft movement noise levels for the day+evening (DE) and night (N) time periods.\nMax is the noise level at the most exposed façade\nMin is the noise level at the least exposed façade.\nBUILDING_PID refers to the GeoScape Building ID (2018/2019), which was utilized to create the initial building footprint noise data.\nFor example, SP_Rd_MAX_E = nosie levels straight out of SoundPLAN for roads, at the most exposed façade, for the evening time period.",

    "description": "This technical report uses farm survey data to measure the contribution of cross-farm resource reallocation to industry-level productivity growth within Australian broadacre agriculture. The results show that resource reallocation between farms accounted for around half the industry-level productivity growth that occurred between 1978 and 2010, and its contribution appears to have increased over time. This effect is mainly caused by the asymetric impact of technological progress on incumbent farms, as reflected in difference in productivity growth and the relative mobility of different production factors. These findings provide useful insights for policy-makers considering industry-level reforms as a means of imrpving aggregate agricultural productivity. ",

    "description": "Data describes habitat suitability modelling (HSM) results for macroinvertebrates in streams. The data was developed by University of Melbourne through the Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership as part of the development of Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018 (HWS2018). Analysis has been undertaken across the Melbourne Water operating region, where the operating region has been divided into 16,346 sub-catchments. Of these 16,346 subcatchments, 8233 contain Melbourne Water waterways. The results are presented for each of these 8233 reaches. The data was used to estimate the scores for macroninvertebrates presented in the HWS for three scenarios:\n\n<ul><li>Current: habitat suitability under current conditions (i.e. 2014).</li><li>Current trajectory: habitat suitability under urbanisation and climate change scenarios if current management approaches continue.</li><li>Target trajectory: habitat suitability given urbanisation and climate change (as for current trajectory), together with (a) delivery of performance objectives of the Healthy Waterways Strategy and (b) achievement of environmental condition scores as described in the Catchment Programs of the Healthy Waterways Strategy.</li></ul>\n\nData has also been captured for a range of modelled HSM scenarios involving revegetation, stormwater management and climate change. Primary purpose is for waterways planning and analysis.\n\n\n\nHabitat Suitability Model results have been thoroughly reviewed and are considered fit for purpose (i.e. for waterway planning). This data set covers the entire Melbourne Water region with the exception of very small areas close to Port Phillip Bay or Western Port. For example, there are small areas of French Island which are not captured.\n\n\n\nThis data set was created using: 1. Streams dataset for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. This layer was developed by GraceGIS using Melbourne Water layers as inputs. 2. Results from Habitat Suitability Modelling for the Healthy Waterways Strategy 2018. \n\n\n\nFurther reading: Chee et al. (in development), Habitat Suitability Models, Scenarios and Quantitative Action Prioritisation (using Zonation) for Melbourne Water’s Healthy Waterways Strategy: A Resource Document, University of Melbourne and Melbourne Water for Melbourne Waterways Research Practice Partnership\n\nMelbourne Water (in development), Healthy Waterways Strategy Resource Document.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Whilst every effort has been taken in collecting, validating and providing the attached data, Melbourne Water Corporation makes no representations or guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of this data.

These moorings comprise the Indonesian Throughflow array, which was deployed in June 2010.  This is an important first step in the enhanced monitoring of northern Australian waters.  These shelf moorings complement the three deep-water moorings deployed in the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait to monitor inter-basin Indian-Pacific Ocean exchange.\n\nProcessed data from the first two deployments (Jun 2010 and Jan 2011) are now available.",

The data is aggregated to the 2019 edition of the Local Government Areas (LGA).\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimates of the resident population are based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census. A person is regarded as a usual resident if they have been (or expected to be) residing in Australia for a period of 12 months or more over a 16-month period.\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 3235.0) available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nFor more information please visit the Explanatory Notes.\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the data.\n\n\nRegions which contain unpublished data have been left blank in the dataset.\n\n",

There are a wide variety of technologies at various stages of technical and commercial readiness, with more development underway for cost effective CO2 capture and storage. Our research will provide new knowledge to inform cost-efficient measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) of the environment of CCS projects in coastal waters.\n--o--\nA Seabird model SBE-45 thermo-salinograph was installed in the carbon team’s container and measured seawater from the ship’s auxiliary seawater pump for the duration of the voyage.  \nSurvey settings:\nA flow of 1.6-1.8 litres per minute was maintained through the instrument.  Readings were recorded once per minute.\nCalibration Information:\nThe instrument is new and was calibrated by the manufacturer in 2017.  Salinity samples were collected for later analysis and a correction will be applied if needed.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number and per cent of women who gave birth and smoked tobacco during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, by the mother's usual place of residence. The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nSA3 is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers for whom smoking status in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was 'Not stated' and mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "After nearly two years of monitoring, comprising 126.7 hours over 57 observations with the Parkes telescope and 49.4 hours across 101 observations with the FAST telescopes, we have determined that FRB 20220529 is an extremely active repeater. It exhibits one of the longest activity durations and a potential period. Due to frequent observations scheduled with both Parkes and FAST, we recently observed an abrupt rotation measure (RM) flare in this source. This is the first detection of such an <code>RM flare'' in a fast radio burst (FRB), suggesting that the source is in an environment with occasionally erupting coronal mass ejection. This presents a unique opportunity to study the eruption environment of FRBs and investigate the relation between burst activity and other burst parameters. If confirmed, the periodicity and the</code>RM flare'' of FRB 20220529 would corroborate each other and become a ``smoking gun'' of the binary origin of FRB. In our previous analysis, both Parkes and FAST observations have proven essential. While FAST's higher sensitivity has enabled the capture of many bursts, Parkes' wideband receiver has provided a good burst detection rate even during low-rate phases. Notably, during the RM flare, two high signal-to-noise ratio bursts from Parkes have been crucial in understanding the RM variations. To further investigate FRB 20220529, we have scheduled regular FAST observations every fortnight, monitoring the source for 20 minutes each time. Therefore, we also propose to monitor FRB 20220529 using the Parkes UWL receiver, ensuring high-time resolution and employing full-polarization observations.",

    "description": "This dataset indicates those modified landscapes that maintain habitat features that are critical to the conservation of biodiversity but do not get recognised (or mapped) as habitat or native vegetation. These are typically substantially modified farming landscapes where existing land uses and significant environmental values co-exist in a way that provides mutual benefits. The generally open and undeveloped nature of these landscapes should be maintained through appropriate zoning to support continuation of the primary production systems that create environmental niches for target species.",
