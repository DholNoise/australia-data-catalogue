    "description": "<b>Version 1 February 2016</b> \nMoreton Bay Regional Council new planning scheme supports growth and maintains the region’s unique characteristics.  Please use this data in conjunction with the Building Heights Overlay and  North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

The site provides additional features for viewing and interacting with the data and for downloading the data in various formats.</em></strong>  \n\nBrisbane City Council has partnered with a number of community gardens around Brisbane to help residents turn food scraps into nutrients for soil.Food waste is a big part of avoidable waste that goes into Brisbane’s general household bins. Composting helps to reduce the amount of food waste we send to landfill, while also reducing the harmful greenhouse gases that are released. It’s also an easy way to experience where our food comes from and shows how valuable our food scraps can be in the cultivation and harvesting cycle.Brisbane’s Community composting hub program encourages residents living near a hub to regularly contribute their food scraps. With support from Council and community volunteer caretakers, residents can learn about the benefits of composting and other ways to reduce the amount of food waste they create.More information on compost and food waste recycling can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/clean-and-green/green-home-and-community/sustainable-gardening/compost-and-food-waste-recycling\">Brisbane City Council website</a>.",

    "description": "AusCPR: Zooplankton Abundance.  The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The zooplankton analysis is conducted differently to that described in Richardson et al 2006 as it is counted off the silk in a bogorov tray. This is accomplished by rinsing the silks in water and straining through a 10 micron mesh sieve. The collected plankton is transferred to a bogorov tray and counted under a dissecting scope. This is done to retain the phytoplankton. After counting the zooplankton and phytoplankton are stored with the silk segment in PGP preservative. AusCPR decided to analyse the zooplankton this way as it provides a more accurate analysis of the zooplankton present. It is easy to miss zooplankton when it is still on the silk and it is harder to identify. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal:- https://portal.aodn.org.au. For information on using the data please refer to the Richardson et al. 2006. As the taxonomic resolution of the data has changed over time, due to continual training, it is important that users refer to the change log tables included in your data download. These will provide information on the validity of the taxa, from what date we have been identifying certain taxa etc. Classification fields may be blank depending on the level to which that taxa has been identified, i.e. if only identified to family, genus and species will be blank. This data is freely available but please acknowledgment all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the current *Forest's of Australia (2023)* dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data.**\r\n\r\nForests of Australia (2013) v2.0 is a continental dataset of forest extent by national forest categories and types. It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources. \r\n\r\n A forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\". \r\n\r\n The dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 presents the new NFI classification with three national forest categories, as reported by the NFI in  Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013  (SOFR 2013), and replaces the spatial dataset titled Forests of Australia (2013). The three national forest categories are: Native forest, Industrial plantations and Other forests. The 'Native forest' category has previously been reported by the NFI, however, 'Industrial plantations' and 'Other forests' are new categories for planted forests: 'Industrial plantations', for plantations managed commercially and reported through the National Plantation Inventory (NPI), and 'Other forest' for planted forest not managed commercially or otherwise not reported through the NPI. \r\n\r\n Forests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's  National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS)  and the  Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) Act 2002.  The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting. ",

    "description": "This dataset contains survey data for bird species across various river and wetland locations in the City of Melbourne. Bird transect surveys were conducted by Ecology Australia at the following locations: Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Wildlife Sanctuary (1), Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Tidal Drain (2), Moonee Ponds Creek lower catchment near Racecourse Road, Kensington and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (3), Maribyrnong River near Newells Paddock and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (4), Royal Park Oak Street Wetland (5), and Stony Creek Backwash, Footscray (6). Surveys were undertaken during daylight hours and were repeated on various dates throughout February and March 2018. Bird surveys were conducted by completing transects along the waterbodies and identifying bird species and numbers. These surveys were undertaken to primarily track bird species richness at Site (1) with Site (3) existing as a reference site with comparable habitat characteristics.\n\nThis bird survey dataset includes the bird’s common name, scientific name, the corresponding Victorian Biodiversity Atlas Code, the date the survey was conducted, and the location of the survey (including the latitude and longitude). The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA) is managed by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and provides a list of species observations in Victoria. Each species has an identification ‘code’ number.\n\nPlease get in contact with the Urban Forest and Ecology Team (nature@melbourne.vic.gov.au) if you wish to view the full report by Ecology Australia or if you have any questions about the dataset.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy. \n\nApproximately once per month between 1988-1991, temperature-salinity surveys were conducted within Jervis Bay and out across the continental shelf. Measurements were made using a Neil Brown 'Smart' CTD. On each day of sampling, ~10 stations were chosen across the shelf, with the CTD recorder measuring salinity, temperature and sigma-T through the water column.\n\nThis record describes CTD data collected in 1990. For each day of sampling three resources are provided: 1) A text document providing details of sampling locations, as well as a CTD summary collected from each of the stations every 4-10 metres down the water column, 2) A map showing the location of each sampling station and, 3) An excel file providing the raw CTD data collected.\n\nThis is one of nine child records that relate to the parent, 13391430-2ae8-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "This dataset provides understorey herbaceous biomass, ground cover and overstorey woody cover response to different fire regimes over a twenty year period at a grassland and open woodland in the tropical savannas of northern Australia. BOTANAL was used to assess understorey herbaceous biomass. Woody canopy cover was derived from digital analysis of oblique aerial imagery taken from a helicopter at the site in 1995 and again in 2013. Woody cover (tree basal area and canopy cover) was also assessed using a bitterlich gauge on BOTANAL ground based transects in 2009. The data could be used to calibrate models of herbaceous growth and woody cover change in response to long term fire. It may be useful for assessing climate change impacts on aboveground carbon sequestration. The fire regimes tested were of varying frequency (every 2, 4 and 6 years) and season (June vs. October) of fire compared to unburnt controls on woody cover and pasture composition. Sites were open to grazing by cattle.",

    "description": "Map notes:North Esk &amp; Tamar Flood Water Surface ProfilesFor use in Planning GeneralThese maps indicate North Esk derived flood levels from the Black Bridge to Corra Linn. The maximum flood levels below Hobblers Bridge and in the Tamar are determined by South Esk discharges into the Tamar which provide higher elevations than the North Esk discharges for the same Average Recurrence Interval (ARI).This map is primarily intended for use in planning to that end it includes:A 100 year ARI profile with current sea level conditionsA 100 year ARI profile with 800mm rise in sea levelA 200 year ARI profileDischargesHydro Consulting was commissioned to review the South Esk hydrology while the North Esk hydrology was derived by the University of New South Wales Water Research laboratory. The Table 1 indicates the results of latter study used in the construction of this map.Flood Return Period in Years ARINorth Esk Flood Discharges (UNSW WRL 2006)South Esk Discharges (Hydro Consulting 2008)1034514302041918105052623301006142910200710(Monte Carlo Range)1850 3430 39905008514630Table 1The adopted tail-water level used in the North Esk analysis for this map was 2.1 m AHD at the junction with the Tamar for all discharges. This represents the highest astronomical tide at Launceston with average atmospheric pressure and neutral wind conditions. The North Esk model was successfully calibrated to the flood which occurred on 30thAugust 2005 which peaked at 470 cumecs and the flood which occurred on 21stJune 2011 at 251 cumecs.",

    "description": "Rodrigues is located at latitude 19°43' S and longitude 63°25' E in the Southwest Indian Ocean and features the best developed reefs in the Mascarenes. \n\nIn 2001 a field expedition to Rodrigues recovered six drill cores using a portable hydraulic drilling rig. In all, two cores were recovered from the windward margin (cores 10 and 17), with a maximum depth of penetration of 4 m. Four cores were recovered from the leeward margin (8, 14, 15, 18) where the maximum depth penetration attained was 4.2 m. Recovery ranged from 23 to 63 %.\n\nThin sections were made and examined petrographically. Radiocarbon dating was performed on selected corals from the base of each core interpreted to have grown in situ and to be free from intraskeletal contamination.\n\nRadiometric dating suggests that Rodrigues reefs approached sea level between 3.1 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP and 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. In fact, the windward margin apparently grew to within 2.5 m of present day sea level by approximately 2.7 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. The leeward margin approached modern day sea level more recently between 1.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP and 2.4 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP. Rates of vertical accretion for the top 4 m of the cores range from 0.46 - 1.96 m / kyr.",

    "description": "The 2013 APS employee census was administered to all available Australian Public Service (APS) employees. This census approach provides a comprehensive view of the APS and ensures no eligible respondents are omitted from the survey sample, removing sampling bias and reducing sample error. The census ran from 15 May to 14 June 2013. Overall, 102,219 employees responded to the employee census, a response rate of 66%. \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the very large number of respondents to the employee census means these files are up to 200 mb in size. Downloading and opening these files may take some time. \r\n\r\n_TECHNICAL NOTES_ \r\n\r\nThree files are available for download.\r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - Questionnaire: This contains the 2013 APS employee census questionnaire.\r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.csv: This file contains individual responses to the 2013 employee census as clean, tabular data as required by data.gov.au. This will need to be used in conjunction with the above document. \r\n\r\n* 2013 APS employee census - 5 point dataset.sav: This file contains individual responses to the 2013 employee census for use with the SPSS software package. \r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents to the 2013 APS employee census, the datasets provided on data.gov.au include responses to a limited number of demographic or other attribute questions.\r\n\r\nFull citation of this dataset should list the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) as the author.  \r\n\r\nA recommended short citation is: 2013 APS employee census data, Australian Public Service Commission. \r\n\r\nAny queries can be directed to research@apsc.gov.au.",

    "description": "Data compiled within this feature class is combined extent of the nominated Hinterland sand flat forests and woodlands of the Sydney Basin Bioregion found across the Lower Hunter region (Cessnock, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland LGAs). This data is for the EPBC Act Listed Ecological Communities Mapping in the Lower Hunter project and has been consolidated to help map the extent of Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) in this area. This data will aid in reviewing and analysing the likelihood of occurrence of EPBC Act listed flora and fauna within the Threatened Ecological Communities, and also support the process of identifying and providing recommendations regarding High Priority Conservation Areas within the region. Recommendations from this data regarding Key Threatening Processes have the potential to impact EPBC Act – listed ecological communities and threatened flora and fauna.\n\n* The GIS mapping data were obtained to inform sustainability planning for the Lower Hunter region, particularly to assist in informing the NSW government review of the NSW Lower Hunter regional strategy and Lower Hunter regional conservation plan.\n* Once this review is complete, the second stage is to undertake a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors. The NSW Government has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to conduct a strategic assessment of proposed urban development and related infrastructure corridors.\n* The data provide the best available maps of the regional distribution of two Critically Endangered Ecological Communities protected under national environmental law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) – as well as the distribution of three vegetation communities nominated for listing as threatened species and ecological communities under the EPBC Act. \n* Vegetation definitions used to map the distribution of the three nominated communities are preliminary and subject to change through the listing determination process. Changes to the definition of a vegetation community may result in changes to the mapped distribution of the community.\n* While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the contents of this dataset are factually correct, the Commonwealth does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or indirectly through the use of, or reliance on, the contents of this dataset.CC - Attribution (CC BY)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia License.

    "description": "MyHospitals provides performance information for public and private hospitals in Australia. You can also compare the performance of these hospitals and find information about hospitals near you.\nThe annual average number of beds available to be used by an admitted patient was grouped into the following categories: fewer than 50, 50-100, 100-200, 200-500 and more than 500. These data are as reported by states and territories to the NPHED, and are referred to in statistical publications (including Australian hospital statistics) as 'average available beds'. The average number of available beds presented may differ from counts published elsewhere. For example, counts based on bed numbers at a specified date such as 30 June may differ from the average available beds over the reporting period. Comparability of bed numbers can be affected by the range and types of patients treated by a hospital. For example, hospitals may have different proportions of beds available for general versus special purposes (such as beds or cots used exclusively for intensive care). Bed counts also include chairs for same-day admissions.\nData is current as of December 2015. Data sourced from: http://www.myhospitals.gov.au/about-the-data/download-data",

    "description": "This data was collected in August 2011 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS2011_T03.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, TAS,   Aug 12, 2011\nArrived:   \tFremantle, WA,   Aug 22, 2011\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",

    "description": "The Victorian Government commissioned Deloitte Access Economics to develop a\nmodel of Victoria’s telecommunications market to provide a tool for government\nand market participants to analyse trends, identify unmet demand and to assist\nin planning for the future. This review is an update of a study undertaken in\n2010 for the then Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development\nby Access Economics and Gibson Quai-AAS, with an extension of the projection\nperiod out to 2016.\nThe model contains estimates of current (2011) service coverage, demand for\nservices, expenditure and subscriber numbers for 10 telecommunication service\ncategories, as well as forecasts to 2016. The spatial building block of the\nmodel and the lowest level of reporting is at the level of Local Government\nAreas (LGAs). The model also includes broader regional aggregates, and\ndistinguishes between household and business customers.\nThe timing of this modelling exercise, at the early stages of rollout of the\nFederal Government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) and during a period of\nrapid development of new applications for telecommunications technologies, is\ndesigned to capture and identify recent and forthcoming changes in Victoria’s\ntelecommunications markets. The model has been built with the intention that\nit can be updated in future years, to include updated data and to reflect\nemerging market trends.  ",

    "title": "Seabed Biodiversity on the Continental Shelf of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area 2003 - 2006 (CRC Reef, CSIRO)",
    "description": "This very large study is published in Pitcher et al. (2007). Its purpose was to quantify patterns in seabed biodiversity and inter-reefal environmental conditions throughout the GBR.\n\nThe study had three aims: (1) Assessment of seabed biodiversity on the continental shelf of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, and assessment of the use of biophysical data as environmental correlates of biodiversity and benthic communities; (2) Mapping bycatch and seabed benthos assemblages in the GBR Region for environmental risk assessment and sustainable management of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, and (3) Assessment of the performance of acoustic remote sensing for seabed mapping and as a surrogate for biodiversity on the continental shelf of the GBR.\n\nIt contains several large data sets, based on >600 km of towed video, ~100,000 photos, 1150 baited remote underwater videos, echograms, ~14,000 benthic samples, ~4,000 seabed fish samples, and ~1,200 sediment samples.\n\nThe eAtlas has processed the Towed video data into a shapefile [1 MB] for dataset visualisation. This processing was done by combining the start and end tow events from the VESSEL_TASKS_ALL table to create a shapefile (GBR_CSIRO-AIMS_Seabed-biodiversity-2003-2006_DropCam.shp) and CSV (GBR_CSIRO-AIMS_Seabed-biodiversity-2003-2006_DropCam.csv) with a line feature for each tow. The information from tables VESSEL_VIDEO_BIOHABITAT and VESSEL_VIDEO_SUBSTRATUM were added as attributes of the line features based on the matching SITE_ID. \n\n\nFormat:\n\nThe processed data from this study is stored in an Access Database (77 MB). The eAtlas summarised the tow video data into a shapefile [1MB] and CSV files (290 KB). Note the attribute names in the shapefile were truncated to 10 characters due to the limitation of shapfiles.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who needed to see a GP but did not in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "The datasets provided contain modelled daily streamflow, and storage volume data for several NSW river systems. These data were generated by simulating baseline river system models used to inform the development of Regional Water Strategies. The models were simulated for three different climate scenarios: instrumental climate (about 130 years), paleo-stochastic climate (about 10,000 years), and paleo-stochastic climate with climate projection based on NARCliM 1.0 (about 10,000 years).\n\nEach modelled output is published as a ZIP file which contains two pdf files (.pdf) and three time series data (.csv).\n\nFor more information on the NSW regional water strategies program, please refer to the following website. https://www.dpie.nsw.gov.au/water/our-work/plans-and-strategies/regional-water-strategies\n\n\n\nThe naming structure of the individual zip files is \"Watercourse at Gauge name, followed by Gauge number\".\n\n1) Tuross River at Tuross Vale Gauge 218001_NARCliM\n\n2) Tuross River at Belowra Gauge 218002_NARCliM\n\n3) Yowrie River at Yowrie Gauge 218003_NARCliM\n\n4) Tuross River downstream Wadbilliga River Junction Gauge 218005_NARCliM\n\n5) Wandella Creek at Wandella Gauge 218006_NARCliM\n\n6) Wadbilliga River at Wadbilliga Gauge 218007_NARCliM\n\n7) Tuross River at Eurobodalla Gauge 218008_NARCliM\n\n\n\nNote: If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.",

The present study, carried out between 2006 and 2008, updates the classification and mapping of the communities.\nThe survey area included all of the Hornsby LGA, from Eastwood to Brooklyn to Wisemans Ferry, excluding Marramarra NP, Muogamarra NR, Long Island NR, and Ku-ring-gai Chase NP east of the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway.\nIn the initial study, the classification of the plant communities was based on the floristic composition of the tallest vegetation layer (usually the tree species composition). The assessment was subjective but based on species data from a total of 404 sample sites. An additional 209 sites were examined for the updated study. The classification has been refined to include 8 EECs, two rainforest communities (instead of one in the original classification), and recognition of the distinctive vegetation of Dangar Island as a separate community.\nVIS_ID 4471\nPlease note the related datasets:\n1.

The mooring is located at Latitude:-36.15, Longitude:135.90. It was first deployed in February 2011.\n\nThis mooring in conjunction with SAM7DS are placed directly along the shelf gradient from NRSKAI to the shelf break.  The purpose of these moorings is to monitor the cross-shelf structure of any currents moving along the shelf break.  They are also used to monitor any uplifted ocean water that may be present during the summer upwelling conditions in the SAIMOS region.\n\nThe Mid-Slope Mooring is maintained for 6-8 months each year, during summer/autumn depending on logistics.",

    "title": "Queensland - National Intertidal-Subtidal Benthic NISB Habitat Map (PLUS)",
    "description": "The NISB Habitat Map was created by the University of Tasmania for a partnership between the Department of Climate Change and the National Land and Water Resources Audit. It supports the DCC/Audit partnership by providing a nationally consistent set of the available mapping data for those habitats that occur between the approximate position of the highest astronomical tide mark (HAT) and the location of the outer limit of the photic benthic zone (approximately at the 50-70 m depth contour). This area is broadly equivalent to the 'inner' and 'mid-shelf' regions identified by Geoscience Australia. The resulting map data set forms a core component of the ECM National Habitat Map Series. The habitat classes include: coral reef, rock dominated habitat, sediment dominated habitat, mangroves, saltmarsh, seagrass, macroalgae and filter feeders (e.g. sponges), as defined in the NISB Habitat Classification Scheme. The scheme is designed to support the development of marine 'ecoregions' or bioregional subregions. Details of the scheme and the process of its development are available in National Intertidal/Subtidal Benthic (NISB) Habitat Classification Scheme Version 1 (Mount, Bricher and Newton, 2007). The NISB Habitat Map consists of two layers for each state. _NISB.shp consists of the entire available habitat mapping at a resolution finer than 1:50 000 (with a few exceptions, outlined in the data quality section below). _NISB_PLUS.shp consists of all the data in _NISB.shp along with coarser resolution data, including NVIS and OzEstuaries data. These layers were used to produce the National ECM Key Habitat Distribution Map Series 10 km and 50 km tile maps.\r\n\r\nNote: This data is labelled as “NISB_plus”, indicating that it is the NISB Habitat layer plus other lower quality layers.",

    "description": "The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project between CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) to measure plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans. The biomass is analysed from the same segment from which the zooplankton is analysed. All the plankton is washed onto a pre-weighed filter. This is left in an oven at 60 degrees C for 24-48 hours.  It is reweighed to give the dry weight. It is advised that anyone using the data should contact the project contact person. The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: * map plankton biodiversity and distribution * develop the first long-term plankton baseline for Australian waters * document plankton changes in response to climate change * provide indices for fisheries management * detect harmful algal blooms * validate satellite remote sensing * initialise and test ecosystem models.  Servicing and maintenance of the CPRs and analysis of the samples for the AusCPR survey will be carried out by staff based at the O&amp;A CSIRO laboratories in Queensland and Hobart and at the AAD in Hobart. The project was funded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and falls with the Ships of Opportunity facility. Data storage and access is planned to be interoperable with other national and international programs through the IMOS Infrastructure. Results from the AusCPR survey are available through the AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au. This data is freely available but please acknowledge all relevant parties, as detailed in acknowledgement section.",

    "description": "The Cooks River catchment is a major watershed within Sydney, draining some 103 km2 and is home to 560,265 people (ABS, 2020). As such, Cooks River is a key catchment in terms of floodplain risk management within New South Wales. The Cooks River catchment extends across multiple Local Government Areas (LGAs) and is of interest to several other state government agencies and community groups. \n\nThis project is the Cooks River Catchment Flood Study Stage 1 and is the first stage of a catchment-wide Flood Study for the Cooks River catchment. Stage 1 aims to consolidate an \nextensive range of datasets, including existing models from Flood Studies and Floodplain Risk Management Studies and Plans. Many of these studies have been supported by the NSW Floodplain Risk Management Program, whilst some have been separately undertaken. The outcome of Stage 1 is a framework to support the development of an integrated and regional floodplain risk management plan in the catchment and to define the basis of future modelling and catchment-wide consideration of flood risk.

They include most of the denser areas with small property polygons, but they can include larger blocks for the convenience of simplifying the boundaries.\n\nAs far as practicable they have been aligned to property boundaries, so a property is either \"inside\" or \"outside\". There are some exceptions for features such as rivers, and multi-part polygons which may have widely separated parts. \n\nThis dataset is used to create the property_view_dvp and parcel_view_dvp datasets. These datasets have a \"display\" column which can be used to limit the display of the property or parcel polygons to appropriate scales. These datasets can be used to improve the efficiency of web mapping.\n\nThe polygons will be updated on an occasional basis to include newly subdivided areas.",

    "description": "This report comprises <strong>Volume 2</strong> of the Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan (FRMP),\nwhich is being prepared on behalf of Mid-Western Council in the area drained by the Mudgee\nLocal Creeks, as part of a Government program to mitigate the impacts of major floods and\nreduce the hazards in the floodplains. Volume 2 details the results of flood behaviour studies of\neach of the creeks.\n\nUndertaking of the flood studies on the creeks was an important first step in the process of\npreparing the FRMP. The flood study is the formal starting process of defining management\nmeasures for flood liable land and represents a detailed technical investigation of flood\nbehaviour.\n\nThis Volume describes the method and results of the investigation to define flooding conditions\non the catchments under both present day conditions and after development according to\nCouncil’s current zoning policy. The study then reviews the impacts of flooding on existing urban\ndevelopment and improvements to the drainage system which could be implemented to mitigate\nflood impacts.",

    "description": "\n## **Abstract** \nThe dataset was compiled by the Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program from multiple sources referenced within the dataset and/or metadata. The processes undertaken to compile this dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. The dataset was developed to assist in the classification of permanent waterholes in the Cooper GBA region.\n\n\n## **Attribution** \nGeological and Bioregional Assessment Program\n\n\n## **History** \nThe dataset contains two shapefiles. The first (COO_Lakes_WH_WFS.shp) contains all the lakes and waterholes identified in the 250K topo maps and uses the Water Observations From Space dataset to find the pixel within each polygon that has the maximum proportion of time inundated (MAX field). Waterholes that are inundated more than 70% of the time (MAX>0.70) are considered to be semi-permanent, those that are inundated more than 95% (MAX>0.95) are considered to be permanent. The second dataset (perm_WH_DTWT.shp) is looking at the depth to water table beneath waterholes. There are no dedicated observation bore networks to look at groundwater levels beneath waterholes so this dataset is using the closest water level observation up to a maximum of 5 km away. The field NEAR_DIST is the distance of the bore from the waterhole and the field WH_DTWT is the  depth to water table below the waterhole assuming that the groundwater level is the same as that in the borehole within 5 km. A positive value in WH_DTWT means that the groundwater level is below the water level of the waterhole, a negative value means that the groundwater level is above the water level of the water hole.",

    "title": "Collation of spatial seagrass data (meadow extent polygons, species presence/absence points) from 1984 - 2014 for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) (NESP TWQ 3.1, TropWATER, JCU)",
    "description": "This dataset summarises 30 years of seagrass data collection (1984-2014) within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.  The Site data describes seagrass at 66,210 sites; while the Meadow data describes seagrass at 1,169 individual or composite meadows.  The data includes information on species, meadow type and age and reliability of the data.  The dataset is available as shapefiles, GIS layer packages, and/or a CSV file.  Data represented in this dataset has been collected by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and CSIRO in a GIS database.\r\n\r\nIn making this data publicly available for management, the authors from the TropWATER Seagrass Group request being contacted and involved in decision making processes that incorporate this data, to ensure its limitations are fully understood. The site and meadow GIS available on eAtlas should be considered a ¿living¿ document that will be updated and modified as new data become available.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nThe sampling methods used to study, describe and monitors seagrass meadows were developed by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and tailored to the location and habitat surveyed; these are described in detail in the relevant publications (https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater). Methods for data sets collected by CSIRO are reported in Pitcher et al (2007). \r\n1. Location ¿ Latitudes and longitudes are from converted RADAR fix or GPS. Depth is depth below mean sea level (dbMSL) in metres.\r\n2. Seagrass metrics ¿ Visual estimation methods prior to 1990 were mostly percent cover estimates matched to standard photographs. Data limitations for these early surveys are specific to each survey and advice from the TropWATER data custodians should be sought for assistance with interpretation. For recent surveys (post-1990) above-ground biomass was determined using a ¿visual estimates of biomass¿ technique (Mellors 1991) using trained observers. A linear regression was calculated for the relationship between the observer ranks and the harvested values. This regression was used to calculate above-ground biomass for all estimated ranks made from the survey sites. Biomass ranks were converted into above-ground biomass estimates in grams dry weight per square metre (g DW m-2) for each site. Observers estimated biomass data using video transects, grabs, free diving, helicopter and walking:\r\n* Video transect: Commonly used for subtidal meadows at each transect site. A CCTV camera was lowered to the bottom and towed at drift speed (less than one knot). Footage was observed on a TV monitor and digitally recorded. The recording was paused at random times and frames selected. From this frame, an observer estimated a rank of seagrass biomass and a species composition. On completion of the video analysis, the video observer ranked five additional quadrats that had been previously videoed for calibration. The camera sled included a small collecting net to obtain a specimen for identification. \r\n* van Veen grab: Commonly used for subtidal meadows. A sample of seagrass was collected using a van Veen grab (grab area 0.0625 m2) to identify species present at each site. Species identified from the grab sample were used to inform species composition assessments made from the recorded video transects (Kuo and McComb 1989), or to record presence/absence where visibility was too poor for video transects. \r\n* Free diving, helicopter and walking: At each site seagrass above-ground biomass and species composition were estimated from 0.25 m2 quadrats placed randomly. Seagrass percent cover was recorded at each site. The ¿visual estimates of biomass¿ technique when applied to free diving/helicopter/walking surveys involves ranking while referring to a series of quadrat photographs of similar seagrass habitats for which the above-ground biomass has been previously measured. The relative proportion of the above-ground biomass (percentage) of each seagrass species within each survey quadrat was also recorded. Field biomass ranks were converted into above-ground biomass estimates in grams dry weight per square metre (g DW m-2).\r\n\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\n\r\nThis section will document changes to the dataset as subsequent versions are released. This section will allow you to tell if you have the latest copy of the dataset.\r\n\r\n- Version 1 (2016-06-09): Initial release of the dataset containing data from 1984 - 2014. The filenames for this release were: GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Site-surveys and GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Meadow-boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\r\nAll survey data were entered into a Geographic Information System (GIS) using MapInfo (generally pre-2005) then ArcMap® software. MapInfo spatial data was converted to ArcMap shapefiles. Rectified colour satellite imagery of the region (Source: ESRI), field notes and aerial photographs taken from helicopter surveys were used to identify geographical features such as reef platforms, channels and deep-water drop-offs to assist in determining seagrass meadow boundaries. Two GIS layers - a Site layer and a Meadow layer - were created to describe seagrass. The projection used for these layers is GDA94.\r\n\r\nShape filenames:\r\n* GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Site-surveys.shp  (Site surveys)\r\n* GBR_NESP-TWQ-3-1_JCU_Seagrass_1984-2014_Meadow-boundaries.shp (Meadow boundaries)\r\n\r\n\r\nData Dictionary:\r\n\r\nSeagrass site Data:\r\n\r\n1.

Data custodians:\r\n- DATA_CUSTO: Data custodians\r\n\r\n\r\nSeagrass meadow data:\r\n\r\n- NRM_REGION: The NRM region in which the survey occurred.\r\n- SURVEY_DAT: Survey month and year, or a list of survey dates for meadows repeatedly sampled.\r\n- METHOD: Sampling and mapping methods ¿ GPS/aerial photography, helicopter, walking, boat with camera, diver, grab and/or sled.\r\n- PERSISTENC: Meadows were classed according to four categories: Stable, Variable, Highly variable ephemeral, or Unknown.\r\n- MEADOW_LOC: Meadows were classed according to three categories, although some meadows cover a range of these locations: Intertidal, Shallow subtidal, or Deep subtidal.\r\n- DENSITY: Meadow density categories (light, dense, variable among years, unknown) were determined by the consistency of mean above-ground biomass of the dominant species among all years sampled.\r\n- DOMINANT_S: Dominant species and species present.\r\n- SPP_PRESEN: All species present.\r\n- MEAN_BIOMA: Mean meadow biomass in g DW m-2 (+ standard error if available), or the minimum and maximum biomass recorded for meadows sampled more than once.\r\n- AREA_HA: Meadow area in hectares (+ reliability estimate if available), or the minimum and maximum area recorded for meadows sampled more than once.\r\n- HECTARES: Total extent of meadow (HA)\r\n- PERCENT_CO: Meadow percent cover - this value represents mean seagrass percent cover, or the range of percent cover (if >1 number in the data cell). Meadow percent cover was most commonly calculated in pre-1990s surveys and recorded as ¿n/a¿ if not available.\r\n- CUSTODIAN: Data custodians\r\n- COMMENTS\r\n\r\nMeadow Persistence:\r\n- Stable: enduring meadow form; seagrass presence, biomass and area expected to be stable over time and seagrass meadow expected to be a permanent feature apart from extreme events or sustained long term impacts;\r\n- Variable: meadow presence, biomass and area expected to fluctuate within and among years, but generally some seagrass expected to be present apart from extreme events or sustained long term impacts;\r\n- Highly variable ephemeral: meadow not persistent over time; at some time periods seagrass will be present and at other times absent. Ephemeral meadows that have a naturally extreme level of variation in area and biomass within and among years; \r\n- Unknown: undetermined persistence as meadow sampled only once.\r\n\r\nMeadow Location:\r\n- Intertidal - all sites surveyed by helicopter or walking within a meadow and/or comments in field books identified an intertidal meadow, \r\n- Shallow subtidal - meadows where free divers SCUBA, sled collection, or cameras were used to sample and water depth was generally <10 m;\r\n- Deep subtidal - for this project meadows >10 m deep were included as deep subtidal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nSpatial limits:\r\nSeagrass data north and south of the GBRWHA were excluded from the layers but are available on request. Data were included when sites and meadows extended west of the GBRWHA boundary into coastal and estuarine water immediately adjacent. In shallow coastal waters seagrass meadows have been mapped and estimates of meadow boundaries are provided in the meadow GIS layer. For deeper water seagrass information is provided as data points in the site layer. Modelled distributions are available (Coles et al 2009; Pitcher et al 2007) but not included here. \r\n\r\nData limitations:\r\nData included extends back to the mid-1980s. Large parts of the coast have not been mapped for seagrass presence since that time. Technology and methods for mapping and position fixing have improved dramatically in 30 years. Early data included here has been re-checked and re-entered on several occasions and previously included in other spatial platforms (see McKenzie et al 2014). The layers included in this report represent the most reliable interpretation of that early data. \r\n\r\nTaxonomy:\r\nSeagrass taxonomy has changed through time, with species such as Halophila ovata no longer recognised and some doubts expressed about other species whose morphology is relatively plastic. Field surveys have at times grouped species that are difficult to distinguish outside a laboratory. To address these issues we have amalgamated some species into complexes: Halophila ovata, Halophila minor, Halophila colesi/australis and Halophila ovalis are included as Halophila. ovalis. Halodule pinifolia is grouped with Halodule. uninervis. Data collected in winter may underestimate the extent of ephemeral species such as Halophila decipiens and Halophila tricostata. This is important if this composite is used to compare annual changes. Zostera muelleri subsp. capricorni has been abbreviated to Zostera capricorni throughout.\r\n\r\nWarranty:\r\nTropWATER gives no warranty in relation to the data (including accuracy, reliability, completeness, currency or suitability) and accepts no liability (including without limitation, liability in negligence) for any loss, damage or costs (including consequential damage) relating to any use of the data. TropWATER reserves the right to update, modify or correct the data at any time. The limitations of some older data included need to be understood and recognised.

To generate the data, an extensive literature review of BNI was undertaken. Based on the available evidence, an APSIM-BNI module was developed using APSIM Manager script and integrated into APSIM. The APSIM-BNI module was evaluated for model sensibility, parameter sensitivity and uncertainty. The developed APSIM-BNI module was then used in a scenario analysis to quantify the plausible impact of BNI on both productivity and emissions from Australian farming systems. This collection includes APSIMX file with BNI manager script, simulation output in csv formats. The output variables reported either daily, seasonal or annual include soil carbon, soil mineral nitrogen, nitrogen loss pathways, soil water, crop biomass, N uptake yield, and gross margins.  ",

The paper examines trends in criminal offences and family violence incidents to 30 June 2020, focusing on comparing the period from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 with the same period in 2019.\nThis paper aims to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic, associated behaviour changes and implemented restrictions impacted on crime in Victoria. It examines whether there were changes in the volume, nature or location of offending recorded by police following the introduction of restrictions in late March 2020 and provides an overview of offences recorded for breaching restrictions introduced to address COVID-19.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) solar panel systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2014 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who felt their GP always or often showed respect for what they had to say in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2014-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of participation statistics in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) for people aged 50 to 74. The NBCSP began in 2006. It aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from bowel cancer by actively recruiting and screening the eligible target population for early detection or prevention of the disease. The data spans the years of 2015-2017 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) geographic areas from the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nCancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Australia. Cancer screening programs aim to reduce the impact of selected cancers by facilitating early detection, intervention and treatment. Australia has three cancer screening programs:\n\n\nBreastScreen Australia\n\n\nNational Cervical Screening Program (NCSP)\n\n\nNational Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP)\n\n\nThe National cancer screening programs participation data presents the latest cancer screening participation rates and trends for Australia's 3 national cancer screening programs. The data has been sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) analysis of National Bowel Cancer Screening Program register data, state and territory BreastScreen Australia register data and state and territory cervical screening register data.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Cancer Screening Programs Participation Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nParticipation rates represent the percentage of people invited to screen through the NBCSP during the relevant 2-year period, who returned a completed screening test within that period or by 30 June of the following year. The number of individuals invited to screen excludes those who deferred or opted out without completing their screening test.\n\n\nValues assigned to n.p. in the original data have been set to null.\n\n\nSA2 areas were assigned to NBCSP invitees using an SA1 to SA2 correspondence. Those invitees without reliable SA1 details were mapped with a postcode to SA2 correspondences instead, which may lead to some minor inaccuracies in results.\n\n\nSome invitee SA1 codes and postcodes cannot be attributed to an SA2. These invitees were included in an 'Unknown' group where applicable.\n\n\nSome postcodes cross SA2 boundaries, leading to slight inaccuracies.\n\n\nBiennial screening for those aged 50-74 is not fully rolled out. During the time period reported, the specific ages invited within the 50-74 age range included 50, 54, 55, 58, 60, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72 and 74.\n\n\nThese results calculate participation rates using the new NBCSP performance indicator specifications. This indicator now measures a 2-year invitation period and also excludes those who opted off or suspended participation. Therefore, these results cannot be compared to rates reported prior to 2014.\n\n\nNBCSP participation rates per area are not related to bowel cancer incidence rates.\n\n\nSA2 areas with a numerator less than 20 or a denominator less than 100 have been suppressed. SA2 data for the Blue Mountains - South, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Illawarra Catchment Reserve, Jervis Bay and Lord Howe Island were suppressed due to reliability concerns from low numbers in these regions.\n\n\nThe 2015-2016 period covers 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016, and the 2016-2017 period covers 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017.\n\n\nParticipation by SA2 is not available for the period 2014-2015.\n\n\nThe number of people in different SA2s may not sum to 'Australia' total due to rounding.\n\n",

    "description": "The NSW SPOT 2025  imagery product is a state-wide satellite dataset for NSW Government. The SPOT 2025 satellite data acquisition period was from December 2024 to May 2025. The imagery scenes used to create the NSW mosaic includes Lord Howe Island. This imagery data set has been acquired through GeoImage Pty Ltd and Airbus Defence and Space.\n\nSPOT satellites offer high resolution imaging over broad areas in a single pass at resolutions up to 1.5m. Such precise coverage is ideal for applications at national and regional scales from 1:250,000 to 1:15,000. SPOT 6 also includes the benefits of the near-infrared (NIR) which enables applications for detection of features not visible to the human eye, such as detecting and monitoring vegetation health.\n\nData products supplied for all of NSW are:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\n<strong>State-wide mosaic High Definition 75cm resolution (GDA2020)</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n\nState-wide mosaic 1.5m resolution (WGS84 and GDA2020/NSW Lambert) \n</li>\n<li>\n\n100k Mapsheet tiles (GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nMulti spectral scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPan sharpened scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nPanchromatic scenes (GDA94 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nShapefile cutlines of statewide mosaic (WGS 84 and GDA2020)\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe statewide mosaic comes with RGB enhancements with 1:10 compression of the pansharpened imagery in ECW  (63GB) and JP2000 (84GB) format. Individual 100k mapsheet mosaics contain RGB+NIR band combination; unenhanced 16-bit GeoTIFF format tile.\n\nThe NSW mosaic is available from internal DCCEEW APOLLO Image Webserver for DCCEEW employees.\n\nThe 4band 100k mapsheet tiles are available for download from JDAP(pending).\nThe rectified multispectral, pan sharpened and panchromatic scenes are available for download from JDAP (pending)\n\nAcknowledgement when referencing: includes material © Airbus DS 2025\n\nContact spatial.imagery@environment.nsw.gov.au for further information or to request access to the imagery or JDAP \n\n<strong>These image products are only available to other NSW Government agencies upon request.</strong>",

Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.\nFor more information please see the Ookla Github repository or the Registry of Open Data on AWS.\nOokla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access.\nAURIN has generated a subset corresponding to the intersection with the extent of Australia.

For each threatened entity, a 'known' or 'predicted' occurrence value is attributed against the individual IBRA subregions that form the species distribution.\n\nAttribution of 'Known' occurrence for an IBRA subregion is based on the existence of at least one valid observation record with a spatial accuracy of better than 10km. 'Predicted' occurrence contain no validated records where the spatial accuracy is better than 10km. The assignment is based on expert knowledge and is generally not assisted by distribution modelling approaches. For species and populations, validation of the underlying species records are managed by the Threatened Species Accountable Officer within the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. \n\nThe data are rendered live from BioNet Atlas to the Threatened Biodiversity Profiles web app https://threatenedspecies.bionet.nsw.gov.au/.\n\nThese distributions are pulled from the BioNet OData Web Service entity sets; ThreatenedBiodiversity_TECGeographicData, ThreatenedBiodiversity_TPGeographicData and ThreatenedBiodiversity_TSGeographicData.

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of selected women who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced. This has been calculated with the number of selected females who gave birth for the first time and who had labour induced, divided by all selected females, and multiplied by 100. The data spans the years of 2012-2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nWomen included are those who gave birth for the first time and met all of the following criteria:\n\n\nAged between 20 and 34.\n\n\nGestational age at birth between 37 and 41 completed weeks.\n\n\nPregnancy has one baby only (singleton).\n\n\nThe presentation of the baby is vertex (baby's head was at the cervix).\n\n\nThe data is sourced from the National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC), which is a national population-based cross-sectional collection of data on pregnancy and childbirth. The data are based on births reported to the perinatal data collection in each state and territory in Australia. Midwives and other birth attendants, using information obtained from mothers and from hospital or other records, complete notification forms for each birth. A standard de-identified extract is provided to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on an annual basis to form the NPDC.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare - National Core Maternity Indicators Data Tables.\n\n\nMetadata Online Registry Entry.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nA birth is defined as an event in which a baby comes out of the uterus after a pregnancy of at least 20 weeks gestation or weighing 400 grams or more.\n\n\nInduction of labour is a set of procedures (pharmacological and/or instrumental) to start the uterus contracting and begin the process of labour.\n\n\nGestational age is a clinical measure of the duration of the pregnancy. For the NPDC gestational age is reported as completed weeks.\n\n\nData for selected women criteria, parity, were not available from Victoria for 2009.\n\n\nData for Tasmania from 2004 to 2012 were not available. For Tasmania from 2005 to 2012, presentations via caesarean births were not reported by hospitals still using paper-based form. Where a caesarean section occurred the presentation was recorded as ‘Not stated’. Presentations via caesarean births were included in the paper-based form from 1 January 2013. The year 2004 was not included in this analysis.\n\n\nThe sum of the reported 'Grouped by' values may not equal the Australia total.\n\n",

    "description": "**This is a superseded dataset, the most recent _Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate_ spatial dataset can be found at: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/indigenous-land-and-forest.**\r\n\r\nThe Australia's Indigenous land and forest estate (2020) is a continental spatial dataset that identifies and reports separately the individual attributes of Australia's Indigenous estate, namely the extent of land and forest over which Indigenous peoples and communities have ownership, management and co-management, or other special rights.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the same as the previously published Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2020) (released 03 December 2020) but with an amended title that more accurately reflects the full extent of the dataset.\r\n\r\nIt was developed from multiple data sources, including national, state and territory datasets related to land in which there is an Indigenous interest. The Indigenous land dataset is then combined with forest cover information from the Forests of Australia (2018) dataset.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the National Forest Inventory (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of final datasets. The following attributes are applied in this dataset:\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous owned__: Freehold land or forest that is owned by Indigenous communities, or land and forest for which ownership is vested through other mechanisms.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous managed__: Land or forest that is managed by Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\n* __Indigenous co-managed__: Land or forest that has formal, legally binding agreements in place to include input from Indigenous people in the process of developing and implementing a management plan.\r\n\r\n* __Other special rights__: Land or forest subject to native title determinations, registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements and legislated special cultural use provisions.\r\n\r\nIn this dataset, the attributes of Indigenous ownership, Indigenous management or co-management, and other special rights are applied separately. The dataset structure therefore differs from Indigenous estate datasets published by ABARES in 2018 or earlier.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The NSW Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) is used by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) to classify drought in New South Wales. It integrates weather, climate, soil, and land-use datasets into a single framework to help decision making.\nThe CDI combines meteorological, hydrological and agronomic definitions of drought using indicators for rainfall (RI), soil water (SWI), and plant growth (PGI). From these, a fourth index, the Drought Direction Index (DDI), is developed. Used together, these indices classify the five categories of drought. By using multiple indicators, the CDI provides an overall indication of drought conditions in NSW. \nThe CDI is a long-term drought indicator which tracks events that are at least 9-12 months in duration. It is not overly sensitive to short term climatic events and for this reason can lag field conditions. \nFor more information on the CDI and its underlying indicators, see https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/interactive-drought-map/Learn-more/understanding-the-cdi-phases\nCDI online interactive map https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/interactive-drought-map\nDPIRD's interactive CDI map provides free access to current and historical drought information at the NSW parish level (~10-20 farms), while the underlying monitoring occurs at 1 square kilometre resolution (data provided by ANUClimate). The interactive map is updated daily and displays the latest (4 days lag) CDI and drought indicator values for NSW. \nTime series CDI and indicator data for up to 5 years before present for a particular location can be obtained by using the location search bar or by clicking on the LLS, LGA, then Parish of interest. Time series can be downloaded as figure files (.jpg).\nCDI data cannot be downloaded directly from the interactive map. For access to the data that is displayed on the map, please visit the Seasonal Conditions Information Portal (SCIP) https://edis.spaceport.intersect.org.au/\nThe Seasonal Conditions Information Portal provides access to monthly snapshots of CDI data in several forms:\nMonthly CDI and indicator GIS .zips containing .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj (2020 January to present),\nMonthly CDI and indicator .csv files (2020 January to present),\n    Monthly LGA percentages in drought .csv files (2016 January to present),\n    Weekly updating high-quality parish-level time series figures (.jpg) (2 years before present to present), and \n    Extended parish time series by decade (1970 – 2020).\nThe NSW State Seasonal Update https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/climate_applications/state-seasonal-update contains a verified version of CDI information released as monthly report and accompanying text.\nIncludes: statewide overviews of monthly indicators, including the CDI, rainfall, temperature, remotely-sensed vegetation and water availability Regional (Local Land Service) breakdowns of seasonal conditions Climate driver updates Seasonal forecasts of rainfall, temperature, and drought.\nNSW Drought in a Changing Climate Report: The NSW-CDI has also been utilised to assesses the longer term risk of future drought using CMIP6 climate projections to drive the EDIS system.  A report summarising the project and its results are available here https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/dpi/climate/seasonal-conditions-and-drought/key-research/drought-under-climate-change.\nAdditional data available by request by contacting seasonal.conditions@dpird.nsw.gov.au",
