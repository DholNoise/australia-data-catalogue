    "description": "This dataset shows the estimated maximum temperature of the warmest period for the Wet Tropics Bioregion of North Queensland over a 24 month period from January 2007 to December 2008. It was modelled based on weather station data, elevation, foliage cover and distance to the coast. The purpose of this dataset is as a metric for estimating thermal stress on animals living in this region.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nThe maximum temperate was modelled over the region at an 80 m resolution using weather station data with adjustments for elevation, foliage cover and distance from the coast. This allowed the temperature to be estimated for locations where there were no direct measurements of temperature. Models of the maximum temperature for each month of the study were generated. These 24 monthly surfaces were then overlaid and the maximum model temperature for any month was determined for each pixel to generate a summary variable - the maximum temperature of the warmest period (i.e., month).\n\n\neAtlas Processing:\n\nThe GeoTiff supplied with this dataset was produced as follows:\ngdal_translate csbc_05.asc -a_srs \"EPSG:4283\" -co \"TILED=YES\" -co \"COMPRESS=LZW\" -a_nodata -9999.0 WT_JCU_Refugia-max-temp_Jan2007-Dec2008.tif\ngdaladdo -r average WT_JCU_Refugia-max-temp_Jan2007-Dec2008.tif 2 4 8 16 32 64\n\nFormat:\nData format ASCII Grid: 170MB, 4089 x 6372 pixels, GDA_94, 80 m resolution. This was converted by the eAtlas team to a 33 MB GeoTiff.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nA detailed description of data and methods are provided in: Shoo, L.P., Storlie, C., VanDerWal, J., Little, J., Williams, S.E.

However, as the correlation between the sedimentary bedrock stratigraphic units above the Walloon Coal Measures in the Surat and Clarence-Moreton basins is poorly understood, it is not possible to directly use the hydraulic parameters from a particular unit in the Surat Basin to inform the hydraulic characteristics of a unit in the Clarence-Moreton Basin. Instead, all the data from the BMO group (consisting of the Bungil Formation, Mooga Sandstone and the Orallo Formation), the Gubberamunda Sandstone, the Westbourne Formation, and the Springbok Sandstone of the Surat Basin were combined.

This was considered an interim site until they relocated to the Brisbane River, eight months later in May 1825.\n\nToday you can walk in their footsteps and hear stories about Redcliffe’s (and Queensland’s) first European encampment. \n\nMoreton Bay Regional Council would like to thank the Redcliffe Historical Society for their support in designing the original trail. If you enjoy the walk and want to find out more, head to the Redcliffe Museum. It’s one of our stops—see the map for location. ",

    "description": "In Western Australia, the Public Sector Commission's purpose is to bring leadership and expertise to the public sector to enhance integrity, effectiveness and efficiency. The Commission’s vision is of a high performing public sector serving the needs of the State now and into the future.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 22D of the Public Sector Management Act 1994, the Public Sector Commissioner reports annually to Parliament on the state of public sector administration and management, and on the extent of compliance with public sector standards and ethical codes. One of the primary information sources used for the State of the WA public sector report 2014 - Measuring up is the public sector entity survey (PSES). \r\n\r\nThe 2014 PSES collected information on the application of Commissioner’s Instruction No. 7 – Code of Ethics, agency codes of conduct and general principles of human resource management and public interest disclosure at June 2014 or for the 2013/14 financial year. The survey was sent to chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief employees of public sector entities with more than 20 full-time equivalents (FTE), including Senior Executive Service (SES) organisations, non-SES organisations and departments of state. Entities with between 20 and 100 FTE completed a shorter version of the survey.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, 86 public sector entities completed the survey. Of these, 19 entities completed the shorter version of the survey. Where entities were not asked a question, responses have been left blank in the data sets.\r\n\r\nThree files are available for download on data.gov.au:\r\n\r\n1)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2014.pdf – the survey instrument sent to relevant entities to access online.\r\n\r\n2)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2014 data.xls – individual agency responses to the PSES with a question key and response key. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\n3)    Public Sector Commission PSES 2014 data.sav – individual agency responses to the PSES, in .sav format to be used with SPSS. Please note some variables have been removed to simplify the dataset. \r\n\r\nFurther information and a summary of PSES data is available in the [State of the WA public sector statistical bulletin 2014 - Measuring up](http://www.publicsector.wa.gov.au/publications-resources/psc-publications/state-sector-report).

They are derived products from MODIS (aqua) images using NASA's SeaDAS image processing software. The extent of the datasets covers the entire Australian EEZ and surrounding waters (including the southern ocean). The spatial resolution of the datasets is 0.01 dd. The datasets contain 36 monthly TSM layers between 2009 and 2011. The unit of the datasets is g/m3.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "Operational map for Lowland Rainforest:\nThe operational map for Lowland Rainforest (LORF) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for LORF.  The Panel found that the determination for LORF relies almost exclusively on a rainforest classification system described by Floyd (1990) where several rainforest ‘suballiances’ make up the LORF assemblage. Floyd’s suballiance classifications presented a challenge to our project as they were largely subjective and were not compatible with quantitative analysis, meaning that it was difficult to distinguish between the LORF TEC and other rainforest vegetation using statistically sound methods. \nTo overcome some of these problems we revisited a set of reference sites that were assigned by Floyd to the suballiances cited in the LORF determination and in other rainforest TEC determinations, and collected new floristic data using standard flora survey methods. We also targeted a range of localities on State Forest that we considered likely to include LORF and other rainforest TECs based on the suballiance descriptions, cited localities in Floyd (1990), and preliminary distribution models. Over 300 new rainforest plots were combined with a large pool of existing data covering eastern NSW to construct a provisional revised rainforest classification. We used the rainforest groups derived from this analysis to compare the species composition of Floyd’s suballiances, determination assemblage lists and recent rainforest classifications included in regional classifications. Rainforest groups (and the plots that defined them) were assigned to the Floyd suballiance with the highest degree of floristic similarity. We conferred with the Panel to resolve any inconsistencies between the results of our analyses and statements relating to the distribution and composition of individual suballiances in Floyd (1990) and the determinations.\nWe then used plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variables to develop a Random Forest (RF) model of the probability of occurrence of LORF. We assessed the location of plots assigned to LORF against the distribution of the RF model on and adjoining State Forests. We then completed detailed aerial photograph interpretation (API) using a prescribed set of mapping classes to delineate rainforest areas for a range of canopy cover thresholds. We constructed an operational map of LORF by assigning our API polygons as being LORF based on the modelled probabilities and plot data underlying the polygon.\nOur mapping identified a total of approximately 14,036 hectares of LORF, the vast majority of which was located in the north coast region. We mapped 13,209 hectares of LORF on the north coast, with the largest areas found in Ewingar and Unumgar State Forests. Only 827 hectares of LORF were mapped on the south coast, with the largest areas found in Yadboro and Currowan State Forests.\nOperational map for Lowland Rainforest on Floodplains:\nThe operational map for Lowland Rainforest on Floodplains (LRFP) was constructed to resolve long-standing issues surrounding its identification, location and extent within the NSW State Forest estate covered by the coastal Integrated Forestry Operation Agreements. \nThe project’s Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) Reference Panel (the Panel) preceded the assessment process by reviewing the determination for LRFP.  The Panel found that the determination for LRFP relies mainly on a rainforest classification system described by Floyd (1990) where several rainforest ‘suballiances’ make up the LRFP assemblage. The determination also identifies a range of floodplain and alluvial descriptors. Floyd’s suballiance classifications presented a challenge to our project as they were largely subjective and were not compatible with quantitative analysis, meaning that it was difficult to distinguish between the LRFP TEC and other rainforest vegetation using statistically sound methods. \nTo overcome some of these problems we revisited a set of reference sites that were assigned by Floyd to the suballiances cited in the LRFP determination and other rainforest TEC determinations, and collected new floristic data using standard flora survey methods. We also targeted a range of localities on State Forest that we considered likely to include LRFP and other rainforest TECs based on the suballiance descriptions, cited localities in Floyd (1990), and preliminary distribution models. Over 300 new rainforest plots were combined with a large pool of existing data covering eastern NSW to construct a provisional revised rainforest classification. We used the rainforest groups derived from this analysis to compare the species composition of Floyd suballiances, determination assemblage lists and recent rainforest classifications included in regional classifications. Rainforest groups, (and the plots that defined them), were assigned to the Floyd suballiance with the highest degree of floristic similarity. We conferred with the TEC Project Reference Panel (the Panel) to resolve inconsistencies between the results of our analyses and statements relating to the distribution and composition of individual suballiances in Floyd (1990), and the determinations.\nWe attempted to use plot data and a selection of environmental and remote-sensing variable to develop Random Forest models of the probability of occurrence of LRFP, but we were unable to assign any of our rainforest groups to the assemblage lists or the primary suballiances cited in the LRFP determination. We overcame this problem by constructing a fine scale digital elevation model (DEM) of landscape elements that we considered were likely to be associated with the range of floodplain and alluvial descriptors identified in the determination for LRFP. We then mapped our rainforest groups onto the DEM and assigned any rainforest assemblage that overlapped with our alluvial and floodplain DEM map as LRFP TEC. Using this method we constructed an operational map of LRFP in State Forests on the NSW coast. Our mapped identified a total of 680 hectares of LRFP, all of which was located in the north coast region. \nOperational TEC Mapping have been derived by API at a viewing scale between 1-4000 using ADS40 50 cm pixel imagery and 1 m derived LIDAR DEM grids for floodplain EECs.",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

    "description": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts of extragalactic origin. Since the discovery of the first FRB in the archival Parkes/Murriyang multibeam data, a broad dichotomy in population has emerged. Some FRBs have been seen to be repeating, while others are not, despite a significant amount of follow-up using different radio telescopes. The repeating FRB 20240114A was recently discovered by CHIME/FRB, which has been seen to have an exceptionally high burst activity. Such extreme burst activity has not been seen in any other source. The repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20240114A, provide an unparalleled window into their circumburst environment due to their repeating nature, which can be used to constrain possible progenitor models and test underlying emission mechanisms. The previous Parkes/Murriyang source follow-up has also revealed intriguing spectro-polarimetric properties, such as frequency-dependent evolution of burst central frequency or chromaticity, a possible activity window, significantly large circular polarisation (CP), and frequency-dependent CP. These properties hold the key towards understanding the circumburst environment of the FRBs, and test possible progenitor models. A large bandwidth instrument with reliable polarimetry has been critical in uncovering these properties. The ultra-wideband low (UWL) receiver on Parkes/Murriyang is ideally suited to explore the source's wideband spectro-temporal and polarimetric behaviour. We propose a campaign to regularly follow up FRB 20240114A to ascertain its long-term evolution of spectro-temporal properties.",

The frequency of service increases in summer when grass grows faster; however, this can be disrupted by significant rainfall or periods of extended dry weather. In these events, services are rescheduled as soon as it is safe and practical to do so.  \n\nIn most cases, the frequency of service ranges from monthly in winter to fortnightly in summer. High-profile parks which attract higher rates of visitors and sports fields are serviced weekly in the peak of summer.  ",

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement. \n\n\n\nThis dataset provides the calibration metrics that describe the results of the AWRA-L model calibration process for the RIchmond river basin. This compares the model predictions with the measured stream flow at 9 stream flow gauging stations in the area. Summary of the \"normal\" and \"low flow\" AWRA-L model calibration metrics undertaken in the Richmond river basin (4 May 2015).\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nTo provide calibration summary of model efficiency etc. for the AWRA-L model in the Richmond river basin.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nStarted with the time series of AWRA-L model predictions for 2 calibrations (1: normal, 2: low flow) at 9 stream flow gauging stations.\n\n\n\nCompared these predictions to the measured stream flow at the same 9 stream flow gauging stations.\n\n\n\nThese comparisons are expressed through 3 metrics that compare the daily predictions with the observed data for both calibrations at each of the 9 stream flow gauging stations.\n\n\n\n1) F value\n\n2) daily flow efficiency\n\n3) Bias\n\n\n\nDetails of the metrics themselves are in CLM 2.6.1: Table 4\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (2015) Clarence-Moreton AWRA-L calibration results.

    "description": "The project will determine the status of threatened marine (green, hawksbill and flatback) turtles and dugongs in the Torres Strait and threats to these populations. It also will investigate links between different populations of dugongs and turtles in terms of movement and habitat use. They will also assess the abundance of dugongs in the Torres Strait using aerial surveys.\n\nWorking in conjunction with the Torres Strait Regional Authorities (TSRA) Land and Sea Unit and the TSRA Community Ranger program this project will:\n<ol>\n<li>\n\nDetermine the status of green turtles in Torres Strait (sex ratios, patterns of juvenile recruitment, nesting success and hatchling production) using seasonal surveys of green turtle foraging and nesting sites. Foraging sites will vary to cover as many different habitats as possible (e.g. one per year). Nesting sites will include Maizub Kaur (Bramble Cay) and Dowar Island (Mer Group)\n</li>\n<li>\n\nDetermine the status of hawksbill and flatback turtles in Torres Strait by conducting Iama community and Mabuiag Community seasonal surveys and trial remote camera deployments at Sassie Island and Malu Kiai (Deliverance Island) to quantify nesting events, which are suspected to be declining, and predation levels, which are speculated to be high. Data will then be used in combination with survey data collected by QDERM (Col Limpus) since 1992, and other life history and mortality data to determine a robust account of population status.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nInvestigate population connectivity of dugong and green turtles using satelite tracking of dugongs caught in the northern section of Torres Strait (i.e. around Biogu), analysis of previous tracking data (from QDERM, CRC TS, MTSRF and AMMC) of turtles and dugongs and collection of skin samples from dugongs and green turtles to strengthen the genetic understanding.\n</li>\n<li>\n\nUndertake dugong and turtle aerial surveys in March 2011 and November 2013 of western Torres Strait, including the Dugong Sanctuary and the area west of Orman Reef in association with a parallel survey of the northern GBR. \n</li>\n<li>\n\nAnalyse historical data to examine patterns of turtle abundance in key areas such as western Torres Strait and the Dugong Sanctuary.\n</li>\n</ol>",

    "description": "This dataset includes City of Melbourne’s mapping of greening potential in laneways across the municipality. 'Greening' in this dataset refers to four types of possible greening responses: forest lanes, farm lanes, park lanes and vertical gardens. Higher gridcodes indicate lower potential for adaptation - i.e. a gridcode of 1 is optimal.\n\n\n\nThis dataset can be used the general public, developers, landscape architects and other interested parties who want to know what the future of green laneways may look like for Melbourne. This dataset can be used as a starting point for greening projects including forest, farm and park lanes as well as vertical gardens\n\n\n\nAnyone interested in potential greening within the city should contact the City of Melbourne or visit the Green Infrastructure webpages found on the <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/community/greening-the-city/green-infrastructure/Pages/green-roofs-walls-facades.aspx/\"> City of Melboune website here</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.growinggreenguide.org/\">Growing Green Guide</a> is another helpful and comprehensive guide for the building and maintaining green roofs, walls and facades in Melbourne and Victoria.\n\n\n\nThe Laneways with greening potential dataset is part of a larger suite of work by City of Melbourne to explore and implement contemporary and unique ways of greening in the city that can help combat increased urban density and loss of public open space. Green laneways are an exciting way to liven up the city, and help residents and visitors to explore Melbourne while also combating increasing threats of stormwater runoff, the urban heat island and biodiversity loss.",

    "description": "This dataset is a component of the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project conducted by the Department of Defence, CSIRO and the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nThe meteorological station (35.133S, 150.762E) recorded winds and atmospheric pressure at Governor Head (Jervis Bay). The site is several hundred metres inland of 50m high cliffs and is 63m above sea-level.\n\nThis record provides wind statistics for October 1990. Five datasets are included here representing different times of the day: 0000-0545, 0600-1145, 1200-1745 and 1800-2345. Individual measurements have been converted so that trends of wind speed and direction can be seen for the time period in question. The fifth dataset incorporates all the wind data collected irrespective of time providing a monthly summary. The station initially recorded wind data at 15 minute intervals.\n\nThis is one of thirty-six child records that relate to the parent, 629051e0-2b7b-11dd-a343-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to the 'Jervis Bay Baseline Studies' project is available to download through this record. Meteorological data was collected to investigate wind forced circulation in Jervis Bay, NSW.",

The data spans the year of 2016 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Data Collection (NPDC). The NPDC began in 1991 and is a collaborative effort by the AIHW and state and territory health departments. Perinatal data are collected for each birth in each state and territory, usually by midwives and other birth attendants. The data are collated by the relevant state or territory health department and a standard de-identified extract is provided to the AIHW on an annual basis to form the NPDC. The NPDC covers both live births and stillbirths, where gestational age is at least 20 weeks or birth weight is at least 400 grams, except in Victoria and Western Australia, where births are included if gestational age is at least 20 weeks or, if gestation is unknown, birthweight is at least 400 grams.\nThe Mothers and Babies data accompanies the Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 - In Brief Report.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Australia's Mothers and Babies 2016 Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPHN is derived from Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) of the ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard Edition 2011. Numbers may not sum to totals due to rounding error.\n\n\nExcludes mothers for whom gestation at first antenatal visit was 'Not stated' and mothers not usually resident in Australia or whose SA2 of usual residence was 'Not stated'.\n\n",

    "description": "    \n\nIn March 2003, banks and selected Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs)\nbegan reporting their international assets, liabilities and country exposures\nto APR in ARF/RRF 231 International Exposures. This return is the basis of\nthe data provided by Australia to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\nfor its International Banking Statistics (IBS) data collection. APR ceased\nthe RFC data collection after September 2010.\n\nThe IBS data are based on the methodology described in the [BIS Guide on\nInternational Financial Statistics\n[PDF]](http://www.bis.org/statistics/intfinstatsguide.pdf) (see Part II\nInternational banking statistics). Data reported for Australia, and other\ncountries, on the BIS website are expressed in United States dollars (USD).\n\nData are recorded on an end-quarter basis.\n\nAll banks operating in Australia complete ARF 231. Between March 2003 and\nSeptember 2010, only those larger RFCs with sizeable overseas assets and/or\nliabilities completed RRF 231. Bank and RFC positions are reported in\nAustralian dollars (AUD). Non-AUD denominated positions have been converted to\nAUD using an appropriate end-quarter exchange rate, so changes in reported\ndata between quarters are due not only to changes in positions but also\nvaluation gains or losses due to exchange rate changes.\n\nThere are two sets of IBS data: locational data, which are used to gauge the\nrole of banks and financial centres in the intermediation of international\ncapital flows; and consolidated data, which can be used to monitor the country\nrisk exposure of national banking systems. Only locational data are reported\nin this statistical table and all assets are reported at market value. A\n\nThe locational data presented in this statistical table may differ from the\nbalance sheet data reported by banks (and RFCs between March 2003 and\nSeptember 2010) in their ARF/RRF 320.0 Statement of Financial Position return\nto APR (and published in statistical tables B2, B3, B9 and B10). ARF/RRF 231\nasks for gross positions to be reported (including on-balance sheet\nderivatives). However, in ARF/RRF 320.0, derivative positions can be reported\non a net asset or net liability basis. This difference is particularly\nrelevant in the case of foreign currency derivative positions with residents\nin Australia (included in other assets and other liabilities in the locational\ndata).\n\nData are shown for a selected group of countries that account for the bulk of\nthe total. Similar data for other countries are also available in statistical\ntable B12.1.1.\n\nThe positions by country are summed to produce a aTotal non-residentsa figure\nthat represents reporting entitiesa total positions with offshore\ncounterparties in all currencies. The positions shown for Australia are\npositions with residents in foreign currency.\n\naLoansa comprise those financial assets that are created through the lending\nof funds by a creditor (lender) to a debtor (borrower) and that are not\nrepresented by negotiable securities.\n\nSale and repurchase transactions (repos) involving the sale of assets (e.g.\nsecurities and gold) with a commitment to repurchase the same or similar\nassets, financial leases, promissory notes, non-negotiable debt securities,\nendorsement liabilities arising from bills rediscounted abroad and\nsubordinated loans (including subordinated non-negotiable debt securities) are\nalso included as aLoansa.\n\naDebt securities helda are all negotiable short- and long-term debt\ninstruments (including negotiable certificates of deposit, but excluding\nequity shares, investment fund units and warrants). Also included are those\ninternational debt securities held in an entityas own name but on behalf of\nthird parties as part of trustee business. Debt securities held on a purely\ncustodial basis for customers and debt securities acquired in the context of\nsecurities lending transactions without cash collateral are not included in\nthe data on holdings of debt securities. The borrowing of securities that are\nsubsequently sold to third parties may result in negative holdings of\nsecurities.\n\naOther assetsa mainly comprise equity shares (including mutual and investment\nfund units and holdings of shares in a reporting entityas own name but on\nbehalf of third parties), participations, on-balance sheet derivative\ncontracts and working capital supplied by head offices to their branches\nabroad.\n\nNegative asset positions may be reported due to short selling of securities\nacquired in the context of repo or bond lending transactions.\n\nReporting entitiesa holdings of international notes and coin that are in\ncirculation and commonly used to make payments are recorded as claims in the\nform of loans and deposits. Loans that have become negotiable de facto are\nclassified under debt securities.\n\n",

In some areas of the Wheatbelt, more than 90 per cent of the native vegetation has been cleared, with the flow-on effect being loss of animal habitat and connectivity between the remaining remnant vegetation. The roadside remnants now fulfil an important function in linking a fragmented landscape and enhancing wildlife dispersal. Roadside vegetation also meets other important roles such as: \"mitigation against erosion and soil drift; \"shelter for adjoining properties; \"material for revegetation; \"wildflower tourism; and \"a sense of place or local identity for the local community\".\n\nwas formally Roadside Conservation Committee(RCC) -  Status Map (DPAW-042)",

In collaboration with the NSW Rural Fire Service, DPE Remote Sensing &amp; Regulatory Mapping team has developed a semi-automated approach to mapping fire extent and severity through a machine learning framework based on sentinel 2 satellite imagery. The statewide severity map has standardised classes to allow comparison of different fires across the landscape. The FESM severity classes include: unburnt, low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy), moderate severity (partial canopy scorch), high severity (complete canopy scorch, partial canopy consumption), extreme (full canopy consumption).\n\nThis dataset represents the 2021/22 fire year including all wildfires &gt;10ha and all hazard reduction burns &lt;100ha with a fire start date between July 2021 and June 2022.",

    "description": "The Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions dataset is maintained for the purpose of authoritative reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries. \n\nThe 2016 version 2 updates the marine portion of the NRM regions to be consistent with the current (2015) Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System (AMBIS) coastal water limit boundary. It also includes a new unique ID field for sorting purposes (this is explained in detail below). Three NRM names have also been updated as a result of new information from relevant state/territory agencies and/or NRM regional bodies, as follows: \n\n1. “Avon” changed to “Wheatbelt”\n2. “North West” changed to “Cradle Coast”\n\nThe 2016 version 2 maintains definitions established in the 2015 version, including for the Peel-Harvey NRM region and for the OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation (not spatially defined). It also maintains changes made in earlier versions including: the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas; and the 2012 update/formalisation of the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset. \n\nWhilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\n\nIn total, this dataset now represents 61 NRM regions, two of which have large and remote islands which are distinguished in the spatial data, resulting in 63 map objects. The 61 NRM regions comprise 56 mainland regions administered by 55 NRM regional bodies (the Cooperative Management Area in QLD is jointly administered by the two adjacent regional bodies: the Cape York and Northern Gulf NRM bodies) and seven islands (five administered by the Australian Government as external territories, and two administered by nearby mainland NRM regional bodies, which are shown as separate map objects).\n\nThe 2016 version 2 includes a new unique ID field in the table structure to allow for sorting based on state, region name and region object (where there is more than one part). The following list of regions includes the new NRM_ID field as a reference:\n\nNew South Wales\t\n1010\tCentral Tablelands\n1020\tCentral West\n1030\tGreater Sydney\n1040\tHunter\n1050\tMurray\n1060\tNorth Coast (excluding Lord Howe Island)\n1061\tNorth Coast - Lord Howe Island\n1070\tNorth West NSW\n1080\tNorthern Tablelands\n1090\tRiverina\n1100\tSouth East NSW\n1110\tWestern\n\nVictoria\t\n2010\tCorangamite\n2020\tEast Gippsland\n2030\tGlenelg Hopkins\n2040\tGoulburn Broken\n2050\tMallee\n2060\tNorth Central\n2070\tNorth East\n2080\tPort Phillip and Western Port\n2090\tWest Gippsland \n2100\tWimmera\n\nQueensland\t\n3010\tBurnett Mary\n3020\tCape York\n3030\tCondamine\n3040\tCooperative Management Area (administered jointly by Cape York and Northern Gulf)\n3050\tDesert Channels\n3060\tFitzroy \n3070\tBurdekin\n3080\tNorthern Gulf\n3090\tBorder Rivers Maranoa-Balonne\n3100\tMackay Whitsunday\n3110\tSouth East Queensland\n3120\tSouth West Queensland\n3130\tSouthern Gulf\n3140\tWet Tropics\n3150\tTorres Strait\n\nSouth Australia\t\n4010\tAdelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges\n4020\tAlinytjara Wilurara\n4030\tEyre Peninsula\n4040\tKangaroo Island\n4050\tNorthern and Yorke\n4060\tSouth Australian Arid Lands\n4070\tSouth Australian Murray Darling Basin\n4080\tSouth East\n\nWestern Australia\t\n5010\tNorthern Agricultural\n5020\tPeel-Harvey\n5030\tPerth\n5040\tRangelands\n5050\tSouth Coast\n5060\tSouth West\n5070\tWheatbelt\n\nTasmania\t\n6010\tCradle Coast\n6020\tNorth\n6030\tSouth (excluding Macquarie Islands)\n6031\tSouth - Macquarie Islands\n\nNorthern Territory\t\n7010\tNorthern Territory\n\nAustralian Capital Territory\t\n8010\tACT\n\nExternal Territories \t\n9010\tAshmore and Cartier Islands\n9020\tChristmas Island\n9030\tCocos Keeling Islands\n9040\tHeard and McDonald Islands\n9050\tNorfolk IslandData to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en\nCC - Attribution (CC BY)\n© Commonwealth of Australia (Department of the Environment) 2015",

    "description": "Long-term annual monitoring of Ruppia tuberosa in the Southern Coorong in South Australia is undertaken by the University of Adelaide. The monitoring commenced in 1998 focusing on winter sampling, and it was extended in 2013 to include summer sampling.\r\nR. tuberosa is a native submerged aquatic plant, commonly known as tuberous sea tassel. It provides habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates, fish and herbivorous waterbirds in the Coorong. The LLCMM region, which includes the Coorong, is a Ramsar-listed wetland of international importance. It is also one of the icon sites under The Living Murray program. The condition of the LLCMM region, and aquatic native vegetation recruitment and populations, have been identified as targets against which to assess progress towards achieving the objectives of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The Ruppia monitoring data and findings form part of the ecological information used for this assessment.\r\nThe 2016-17 monitoring program was funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA). Prior to 2016-17, the program was funded by the MDBA, South Australia’s Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR), Earthwatch Australia and the University of Adelaide in different years\r\nThe MDBA has made the R. tuberosa database and related resources publicly available on data.gov.au as part of its commitment to the Australian Government policy on public data and information. The terms and conditions for using the data and related resources from this website can be found at https://www.data.gov.au/about.\r\n  \r\n",

    "description": "A water allocation is the percentage of a licensed water user’s entitlement that is credited to their water account for use. We announce allocations each year on 1 July and regularly thereafter until all licence categories in a water source are fully allocated.\n\nWe allocate water using water sharing plans to ensure long-term water security and prioritised access to water across NSW. Allocations vary based on the water available in dams, river flows, and the prevailing catchment and weather conditions. In formal terms, allocations are sometimes known as Available Water Determinations.\n\nA detailed description of the AWD process is provided on the DPE-Water website and can be accessed <a href=\"https://water.dpie.nsw.gov.au/our-work/allocations-availability/allocations/how-water-is-allocated\">here.</a>\n\nThe AWD for Supplementary licence accounts is a separate process and is not dependent on the water available. It is made once at the start of the year and unless there is a management change because of the growth in use strategy, it is maintained at the maximum value prescribed in the plan, which is generally 1 megalitre per share (equivalent to 100% of entitlement). \n\n\n\n<strong>Notes</strong>\n<em>1. This dataset is included in the General Purpose Water Accounting Reports: https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-general-purpose-water-accounting-reports</em>\n\n<em>2. If you would like to ask a question, make any suggestions, or tell us how you are using this dataset, please visit the <a href=\"https://water-hub.seed.nsw.gov.au/thread/search\">NSW Water Hub which has an online forum</a> you can join.</em>",

    "description": "The Stream Metabolism and Water Quality Basin Matter seeks to evaluate the influence of Commonwealth environmental water on two key ecological processes—primary production and decomposition—which have a profound effect on ecosystem character and condition. \r\n\r\nThe CEWO’s LTIM Project examined the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and assisted the CEWO to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation was focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. These areas will continue to be monitored through the CEWO’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) Program.  \r\n\r\nData collected by monitoring at Selected Areas is used to evaluate local outcomes from watering and also contributed to the analysis and evaluation of Basin Plan objectives.\r\n\r\nStream metabolism data was collected over the duration of the LTIM Project from 2014-15 to 2018-19 in six Selected Areas* (Edward/Kolety-Wakool, Lachlan, Goulburn, Murrumbidgee, Warrego-Darling and Lower Murray).\r\n\r\n*Stream metabolism is not a Category 1 indicator in the Gwydir Selected Area.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Murray-Darling Basin LTIM Project: 2018-19 Basin-scale evaluation of Commonwealth environmental water – Stream Metabolism and Water Quality Report for the detailed method on data used for evaluation.  \r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Office acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We thank them for their knowledge and science and respect their continuing connection to culture and Country and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n",

The assessment uses the adopted hydrologic and hydraulic models for the catchment from  ‘Wianamatta South Creek Catchment Flood Study – Existing Conditions’ (Revision I, Advisian 2022) to define contemporary flood characteristics and to test a range of development and floodplain modification scenarios.\n\nThe assessment:\n- highlights the critical importance of maintaining areas of flow conveyance and flood storage. \n- developed mapping of the areas critical to the conveyance of floods that should not be disturbed or too heavily vegetated \n- provides a list of recommendations that are considered essential for mitigating the cumulative impacts of potential future development in the Wianamatta South Creek Catchment",

The data is aggregated to 2015 Primary Health Network (PHN) geographic boundaries based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe chronic kidney disease (CKD) datasets were released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to present data on prevalence, treatment (hospitalisations for CKD and dialysis) and deaths. It shows the distribution of the impact of CKD across Australia and visualises rates of CKD and the health and demographic profile for local areas.\nThe data was modelled by the AIHW from The National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) which is compiled from data supplied by the state and territories. Hospitalisation counts are counts of admitted patient episodes of care not individual patients, and would include multiple hospitalisations experienced by the same individual if the individual had more than one hospitalisation for CKD in the given time period.\nFor further information about this dataset, please visit:\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease data.\n\n\nAIHW Geographical variation in chronic kidney disease report.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nWhere data has not been published due to small numbers, \"n.p.\" in the original data, the value has been set to null.\n\n\nWhere values have been identified to have a relative root mean square error (RRMSE), a new column has been added where \"*\" presents an RRMSE between 25% and 50%. This data should be used with caution.\n\n\nThese counts do not include home dialysis services received by patients and dialysis treatment completed in Emergency Department before their hospital admission.\n\n",

This coordinated approach allows for cost effective surveying that would not be possible if council’s commissioned surveys individually.\r\n\r\nParticipation in the state-wide Local Government Community Satisfaction Survey is optional and participating councils have a range of choices as to the content of the questionnaire and the sample size to be surveyed, depending on individual strategic and financial considerations.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the survey are to assess the performance of Ballarat City Council across a range of measures and to seek insight into ways to provide improved or more effective service delivery. The survey also provides City of Ballarat with a means to fulfil some of its statutory reporting requirements as well as acting as a feedback mechanism to LGV.\r\n\r\nResults from the annual Ballarat Community Satisfaction / Perceptions Survey. \r\n\r\nAlthough all due care has been taken to ensure that these data are correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by the City of Ballarat in their use.",

    "description": "    \n\nMean annual (00) and monthly (01a|12) transpiration (mm) from the plant canopy\nfor the period 1980-1999.Interpretation:Canopy transpiration is far more\nspatially variable than potential evaporation, reflecting the effects of water\nlimitation in most areas of the continent. Both the annual mean and seasonal\npattern broadly resemble the corresponding patterns for rainfall. Canopy\ntranspiration maps have more acontrasta (relative variation) than the total\nevaporation or rainfall maps because transpiration is a small component of\ntotal evaporation in areas of low plant cover (the remainder being soil\nevaporation).The partitioning between soil evaporation and canopy\ntranspiration in the model is determined by leaf area index.Notes: These are\nmodel-based estimates from the BiosEquil model. Results are given for the\naBASEa (pre-1788) and aAGRICa (present day) conditions.

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map and can be used as a backdrop layer in conjunction with other spatial information.\n\n\nSpatial Resolution - 10 cm\nSpatial Accuracy - +/- 3 pixels @ 68% confidence (Sigma 1)\nMap Projection - Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere\nRectification Surface - DTM (supplied by DNRM in .img format)\nDescription of Rectification - High end commercial photogrammetric software and Aerometrex proprietary software has been utilised in the ortho rectification and mosaicing process. This methodology assists Aerometrex to produce a seamless geo-referenced orthophotography product.\nTile Size / Grid - 1km x 1km GeoTIFF Tiles\n\n<b>Limitations of Data</b>\nThis dataset contains imagery which has been aero-triangulated, spatially adjusted and rectified using a digital ground surface model. The stated spatial accuracy of this product is relevant for features present at ground level only. Elevated structures (roof-tops, tree canopies, etc) will be affected by relief displacement and cannot be reliably measured from this product. Spatial accuracy is reduced in areas of dense vegetation. ",

    "description": "The Flow-MER research project identification and characterisation of refuge habitat research project applied systematic conservation planning using MARXAN to identify wetlands in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB ) that may act as climate refugia.  Refuge habitats were identified as wetlands with the least deviation in water levels, that were the most feasible to manage and could supported target species, ecosystems and functions.  MARXAN uses a simulated annealing algorithm to identify a set of planning units that maximises the representation of ecological asset, while aiming to capture a defined target for each asset and minimise ‘cost’. The ‘cost’ of a planning unit was weighted by its capacity to act as a refuge (dryness anomaly), catchment condition and connectivity (River Disturbance Index) and management feasibility (previous environmental water delivery).\r\n\r\nThe two data tables join to the Australian National Aquatic Ecosystems (ANAE) v3.0 Classification of the Murray-Darling Basin (2021)  using the mapped wetland polygon UID attribute.\r\n1.\tmarxan_cost_managable_floodplain.csv contains MARXAN cost values and final solution set for all lakes and palustrine wetland within scope for water management (on the managed floodplain) in the MDB.\r\n2.\tmarxan_cost_wetlands_water_mgmnt_2014-2020.csv contains the MARXAN attributes and solution for the subset of wetlands that have previously received Commonwealth environmental water during the 6 year period 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings.\r\n\r\nWetlands and lakes are refuges for plants and animals during droughts and other hard times. Maintaining refugia in the Murray–Darling Basin is a key objective of Commonwealth environmental water management.\r\n\r\n### Project Report\r\nBennett J M, Brooks S, Bush A, Hitchcock J, Linke S (2023) Identifying and characterising refugia habitat for target organisms across the Murray–Darling Basin.

    "description": "This dataset presents information and locations related to The Super Tuesday Bike Count event in Darwin for 2016. The counts are presented as individual points which relate to the location where the counts were undertaken by volunteers.\nThe Super Tuesday Bike Count collects annual figures of bicycle riders and their movements on roads and bike paths. Since 2007, Bicycle Network has conducted bicycle counts at key intersections and corridors selected by local governments. The data is available for researchers and policymakers to plan and build cycling infrastructure to promote increased cycling activity, and to gather longitudinal insights of cycling volumes and trends.\nSuper Tuesday count data is collected visually by volunteer counters at intersections along popular commuter routes, as well as subsidiary routes with lower rider volumes. The count is conducted in southern states (VIC, NSW, SA, WA) between 7:00-9:00am on the first Tuesday of March; and in northern states (QLD, NT) between 6:30-8:30am on the first Tuesday of September. Count locations are nominated by traffic engineers, transport planners, and other transport officers from participating councils. Counters record all movement directions, rider gender, and bicycle volume per fifteen-minute increments on standardised count sheets. \nFor more information please visit the Norther Territory Government Open Data Portal or view the Bicycle Network Super Tuesday Count Report.\nPlease note: \n\nWhere there was no data available (\"no data\", \"NA\", \"#N/A\" in the original data) the values have been set to NULL.\n",

    "description": "__Note: This dataset has been superseded by the__ _Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities - Update December 2023_ available at https://doi.org/10.25814/zfjz-jt75.\r\n\r\nThe Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2020 dataset shows the location and extent of select agricultural, mining and forest product commodities, where mapped. This dataset replaces the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2018 version 2 released on 26 November 2019. This dataset is the third national compilation of catchment scale commodity data for Australia (CLUMC), current as at December 2020. It has been compiled from vector land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs through the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP). The commodities data complements the Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020 dataset (ABARES 2021).\r\n\r\n##What’s new?##\r\nThe following areas have updated mapping since the December 2018 version 2: Burnett-Mary and Fitzroy natural resource management (NRM) regions in Queensland (2017 from 2009); Sydney basin in New South Wales (2017 from 2003); the state of Tasmania (2019 from 2015). \r\nMore detail has been added in the Darwin-Litchfield and Katherine areas in Northern Territory (2016).\r\nUsers should update any references or links to previous CLUMC datasets in their databases.\r\n\r\n##Citation##\r\nThis publication (and any material sourced from it) should be attributed as: \r\nABARES 2021, Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Commodities – Update December 2020, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra, February CC BY 4.0.

The data is presented as aggregations following the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA).\nHousehold projections show the number of households that would form if demographic trends continue and if assumptions about living arrangements are realised over the projection period. A household is two or more people who share a dwelling (house, apartment, townhouse, caravan, etc.) and share food and cooking facilities, and other essentials. Household projections show the future number and type of households living in private dwellings. Private dwellings are self-contained accommodation such as houses, apartments, mobile homes or other substantial structures. It does not include accommodation such as boarding houses, nursing homes or prisons.\nThe household projections also include the implied dwelling demand for those households.  This is the likely number of private dwellings needed to accommodate future population-driven demand.\nFor more information please read the Household Projections User Guide.Please note: \n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n",

    "description": "    \n\nData provided are the scale of polygonal datasources used to generate the\npolygon derived surfaces for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.\nData modelled from area based observations made by State soil agencies.The\nfinal ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic of all of the data\nobtained from various state and federal agencies. The surfaces have been\nconstructed with the best available soil survey information available at the\ntime. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One being that an\narea weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for that polygon\nor mapunit. Another assumption made is that the lookup tables provided by\nMcKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict the soil\nattribute values for each soil type.The accuracy of the maps is most dependent\non the scale of the original polygon data sets and the level of soil survey\nthat has taken place in each state. The scale of the various soil maps used in\nderiving this map is available by accessing darasource grid, the scale is used\nas an assessment of the likely accuracy of the modelling.The Atlas of\nAustralian Soils is considered to be the least accurate dataset and has\ntherefore only been used where there is no state based data.Of the state\ndatasets Western Australian sub-systems, South Australian land systems and NSW\nsoil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping would be the most reliable based on\nscale. NSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping however, may be less\naccurate than South Australia and Western Australia as only one dominant soil\ntype per polygon was used in the estimation of attributes, compared to several\nsoil types per polygon or mapunit in South Australia and Western Australia.\nNSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping as the name suggests is\nreconnaissance level only with no laboratory data. The digital map data is\nprovided in geographical coordinates based on the World Geodetic System 1984\n(WGS84) datum.\n\nSee [further metadat](http://data.daff.gov.au/anrdl/metadata_files/pa_dams_r9cl_\n_04011a00.xml) for more detail.\n\n",

A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.",

    "description": "This publication was produced by ABARES for 'Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) Ltd'  \r\n\r\n The report presents results and analysis from a national survey of Australian sheep and cattle landholders in late 2014, in areas affected by wild dogs. The results are combined with data from a similar 2010 survey to assess longitudinal changes in wild dog impacts and management activities. \r\n\r\n Topics cover landholders' perspectives on wild dog problem severity and distribution, personal and economic impacts and collective management actions. The study also quantifies factors that influence the effectiveness of wild dog management groups and their achievement of outcomes. Around 1010 landholders participated in the 2014 survey. \r\n\r\n This study is the final phase in an ABARES research package commissioned by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. (AWI) that explores collaborative action in wild dog management activities. The research aims to assist AWI and other stakeholders design and plan future investment in wild dog management programmes to support industry viability. \r\n",

    "description": "The Joseph Bonaparte Gulf survey (SOL5117, GA survey #0325) was conducted on the R.V. Solander between 30 July and 30 September 2010 in collaboration with staff from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Museum and Art Gallery of Territory (MAGNT). This was a follow up survey from a survey in 2009 (SOL4934, GA survey #0322). The SOL5117 survey was undertaken under a Collaborative Agreement between GA and the AIMS. SOL5117 survey collected acoustic multibeam data (bathymetry and backscatter), sub-bottom profile data, as well as detailed geological (sedimentological, geochemical) and biological (towed-video, benthic sled, Smith McIntyre grabs) data for seabed environments (banks, channels and plains) from 4 offshore grids along a N-S transect.  In addition, shipboard photographs were taken of barcoded biological specimens. The aims of the survey were to map, identify and investigate potential geohazards and unique, sensitive environments that relate to infrastructure; and to use exisitng data to evaluate the capacity to predict geohazards and sensitive environments.\n\nUnderwater video footage and still photographc images (12 megapixel resolution) from towed-video were collected from 46 (Leg 1) and 33 (Leg 2) stations, although quality varies among transects and some still images were not of suitable quality for analysis. Video and image files or associated parent folders are named by station number, gear code (CAM = underwater camera system) and then the deployment number. For example, 'stn48CAM35' would represent a video transect from Station 48 that was the 35th video transect on the survey.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of solar water heater (SWH) air source heat pump systems. The data spans the months of 2012 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nAir source heat pumps were introduced into the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme in 2005 as such there is no installation data available pre-2005 for this fuel source.\n\n",

    "description": "Diversity in the ACTPS workforce from June 2012\n\nThe ACTPS continues to encourage voluntary disclosure by employees. Diversity percentages are based on total ACTPS headcount which assumes that all respondents do not identify as one or more of the diversity groups, which is likely to result in under-reporting of the actual proportion of diversity groups in the ACTPS.\nDiversity statistics are also provided in Annual Reports and monitored through the ACTPS Respect, Equity and Diversity Framework.  Workforce data in this section has been presented in a way that protects the identity of individual employees. \n\nNote on Averages: Salary averages here are inclusive of part-time and casual employees. \n\nPlease see the attached document for additional notes.\n\n[State of the Service 2012]",

    "description": "This dataset contains quality controlled meteorological observations and bulk air-sea fluxes. \n\nEnhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) - Air Sea Flux (ASF) R.V. Aurora Australis collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. \n\nData streams are fed into the existing ship data management system, and broadcast via satellite back to Australia 30 minutes. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm. \n\nA daily file of 5-minute average calculated bulk fluxes are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to eMII.\n\nThe data is contained in NetCDF format files and consists of input QC'd meteorological observations as well as calculated air-sea fluxes. The fluxes are calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux algorithm version 3.0. Input observations are selected from multiple data-streams in the cases of; wind (upwind instrument selected); air temperature and humidity (upwind instrument selected), and short (maximum value used) and long-wave (minimum value used). Other input observations included are sea surface temperatures (SST) and air pressure. Calculated fluxes include, sensible heat, latent heat, outgoing long-wave, outgoing short-wave and heat due to precipitation. The calculated skin SST value is included. Flags are provided to indicate which sensor (when multiple are available) has been used as input to compute the flux. QC flags are not provided as fluxes are only computed when good data is available.",

    "description": "A gravity core (GC09) was collected from a depth of 166m within the Capricorn Channel, southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Samples were separated into different size fractions to determine the % of each grainsize at each sample depth. Although not overly accurate, the information is correlated with analyses of other parameters to impart clues to the environmental changes within the core. This assembly of information suggests that the core reaches the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ~60cm depth, with one indicator being the increase in fine grain material (<100µm). The results also indicate fine grain dominance at a depth of 90cm.",

    "description": "The 2023-24 Budget is officially available at budget.gov.au as the authoritative source of Budget Papers (BPs) and Portfolio Budget Statement (PBS) documents. This dataset is a collection of data sources from the 2023-24 Budget, including:\r\n\r\n* PBS Excel spreadsheets (including Table 2.X.1 Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X in machine readable format) – available after PBSs are tabled in the Senate (~8.30pm Budget night); and\r\n* Selected tables from Budget Paper No. 4 (including in machine readable format) – available after the BPs are published on budget.gov.au (~7.30 pm Budget night).\r\n\r\nThe data has been provided to assist those who wish to analyse and visualise key elements of the 2023-24 Budget.\r\n\r\nData users should refer to footnotes and memoranda in the original files as these are not usually captured in machine readable CSVs.\r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback and comments below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was prepared by the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n__Information about the PBS Excel files and CSV:__ The PBS Excel files published should include the following financial tables with headings and footnotes, which are also are available in CSV. Much of the other data is also available in Budget Papers (No.1) and (No.4) in aggregate form:\r\n\r\n* Table 1.1: Entity Resource Statement\r\n* Table 1.2: Entity 2023-24 Budget Measures\r\n* Table 2.X.1: Budgeted Expenses for Outcome X\r\n* Table 2.X.2: Program Component Expenses\r\n* Table 3.1 to 3.6: Departmental Budgeted Financial Statements and\r\n* Tables 3.7 to 3.11: Administered Budgeted Financial Statements.\r\n\r\nPlease note, total expenses reported in the CSV file ‘2023-24 PBS line items dataset’ were prepared from individual entity program expense tables. Totalling these figures does not produce the total expense figure in ‘Table 1: Estimates of General Government Expenses’ (Statement 6, Budget Paper 1). Differences relate to:\r\n\r\n1. Intra entity charging for services which are eliminated for the reporting of general government financial statements\r\n2. Entity expenses that involve revaluation of assets and liabilities are reported as other economic flows in general government financial statements and\r\n3. Additional entities’ expenses are included in general government sector expenses (e.g. Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited and other entities) noting that only entities that receive funding (either directly or via portfolio department through the annual appropriation acts.\r\n\r\nThe original PBS Excel files and published documents include sub-totals and totals by entity and appropriation type which are not included in the line item CSV. These can be calculated programmatically. Where modifications are identified they will be updated as required.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the line item CSV is:\r\n\r\n* Portfolio\r\n* Department/Entity\r\n* Outcome\r\n* Program\r\n* Expense type\r\n* Appropriation type\r\n* Description\r\n* 2022-23\r\n* 2023-24\r\n* 2024-25\r\n* 2025-26\r\n* 2026-27\r\n* Source document\r\n* Source table\r\n* URL\r\n\r\nThe following Portfolios are included in the line item CSV:\r\n\r\n* Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry\r\n* Attorney-General's\r\n* Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water\r\n* Defence\r\n* Education\r\n* Employment and Workplace Relations\r\n* Finance\r\n* Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\n* Health and Aged Care\r\n* Home Affairs\r\n* Industry, Science and Resources\r\n* Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts\r\n* Prime Minister and Cabinet\r\n* Social Services\r\n* Treasury\r\n* Veterans' Affairs (part of the Defence Portfolio)\r\n* Department of the House of Representatives\r\n* Department of the Senate\r\n* Department of Parliamentary Services\r\n* Parliamentary Budget Office\r\n\r\nTables of interest found in both Budget Paper No.1 Budget Strategy and Outlook and Budget Paper No.4 Agency Resourcing are included for reference as well.",

These patterns can be relevant to deforestation, habitat loss and environment-wildlife-human interactions at a range of landscape scales. Users define their landscape using polygons or points as either shapefile or csv, and select relevant metrics at patch, class or landscape level.  Results calculated by the tool can be viewed interactively using both the table and map in the application or downloaded as a text file for further analysis.   The application uses the 10m Indonesian Hybrid Landcover 2020 - GeoTIFF and Hosted Tile Layer, derived from open source data products (i) ESRI 2020 Landcover, (ii) Global industrial and smallholder oil palm, (iii) Global Human Settlement  and (iv) Open Street Map.

The specific data used for the Evaluation was derived from Basin Plan Model Run 845 which was an earlier version of the final model run (Basin Plan Model Run 871) which was used to establish the Baseline (BDLs) and Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDLs) for the Basin Plan.\r\n\r\nFor the End-of-System Connectivity Theme, the MDBA also drew on data of estimated barrage flows in the Coorong. This data was produced through modelling of barrage flows by the MDBA. Further information on the underlying methodology can be found as part of the MDBA's publications on the [salt export objective and salinity targets for flow management.](https://www.mdba.gov.au/publications-and-data/publications/salt-export-objective-and-salinity-targets-flow-management)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional Resources\r\n\r\n[Link to content landing zone](https://www.mdba.gov.au/water-management/basin-plan/basin-plan-evaluations/2020-basin-plan-evaluation)\r\n\r\n[Link to reports and data page](https://www.mdba.gov.au/publications-and-data/publications/2020-basin-plan-evaluation-reports-and-data)\r\n\r\n[Link to Hydrology dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGM2NWUyNmMtZTY0YS00MWZjLWI1YjgtMjk4MmY0OTRjMDBhIiwidCI6IjFlMjU3ZjA5LWQ5NmItNDkxYS1hNDg4LWRjMmEzOTljYmVlNSJ9)\r\n\r\n[Link to notebook code on GitHub](https://github.com/MDBAuth/FlowAnalysis2020BPE)",

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0305S, 150.756E) between 11/07/90 and 29/08/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\n**Users should be aware that there appears to be some data corruption in the later stages of the datasets collected from 11.5m. In addition to this corruption, the decimated hourly dataset relating to the meter at 5.5m is unfortunately missing**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

In excess of 100,000 cuttlefish aggregate in this area each year to spawn.  The AUV spent one week following the Sir Joseph Banks trip being deployed at night in the shallow waters around these spawning grounds.  In all, 35 dives were completed over a 6 day/night period.  These short dives allowed the AUV to operate in very shallow waters where the cuttlefish are known to aggregate.\n\nThe dive reports from this campaign summarise AUV activity during each dive. Data for this campaign will soon be available.",

    "description": "Turtles that are collected in traps and fyke nets are identified to species and individually measured (shell size) and weighed. Turtle sampling in Flow-MER is not comprehensive and these data provide a record of presence rather than abundance. Some records will be turtles caught as by-catch in fyke nets set that were set in habitats to catch fish and not from sampling for turtles specifically.\r\n\r\nThe CEWH’s Flow-MER program examines the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the environmental objectives of the Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) and is assisting the CEWH to demonstrate environmental outcomes and adaptively manage the water holdings. Monitoring and evaluation is focused in seven Selected Areas: the Junction of the Warrego and Darling rivers, Gwydir river system, Lachlan river system, Murrumbidgee river system, Edward/Kolety-Wakool river system, Goulburn River and Lower Murray River. \r\n\r\nThis Flow-MER data set includes and extends the long-term data collected at the same sites during the Long Term Intervention Monitoring (LTIM) project (2014-2019).\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and Flow-MER program acknowledge the First Nations peoples as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the lands, waterways and skies of the Murray-Darling Basin. We respect their continuing connection to culture and Country, and we thank them for their knowledge and science and the values reflected in these data.\r\n\r\n###Citation\r\n\r\nCEWO (2024) Turtle measurements.

Utilities data supplied included fuel related infrastructure. GHD compiled the utilities data from original CAD drawings collected over many years through management of island infrastructure by the Commonwealth Department of Administrative Services. The CAD drawings were converted into ESRI shapefiles by GHD.\nIn 2006 GHD updated several of the 2001 utilities shapefiles.\nUtilities for the airport, which previously only contained data in the water supply layer, were received from the Indian Ocean Territories Administration (Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities) in January 2013. The new data was provided as dng cad file and included fuel, which was added to the relevant layers.  However the data did not include fuel tanks.\nData indicative only and not to be relied on.

The data is based on 2016 Local Government Areas (LGA) boundaries.\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.\nFor more information visit the AEDC website.\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n\n\nThree or fewer children had been assessed\n\n\nFewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores\n\n\nLess than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location\n\n\nAEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data.\n\n\nAEDC results for Unincorp. Other Territories (LGA code 99399) were split across two records in the original data, AURIN has excluded these results from this dataset.\n\n",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the number of installations of small generation unit (SGU) wind systems and their rated output in kilowatts (kW). The data spans the months of 2011 and includes the total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of SGU (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and solar water heaters (SWH) and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the 2016 ASGS POAs\n\n\nMonthly installation data is provided for months where an installation was registered.\n\n\nThe data is current as at 30-09-2018.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.\n\n\nSmall-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system. This differs for solar hot water heaters and small generation units (solar panels, wind and hydro). Further information can be found at theRenewable Energy Target FAQ.\n\n\nCapacity data has been revised to account for past data entry errors which caused significant inconsistencies. These systems were installed between 2001 and 2003. As a result of this revision, the cumulative installed capacity from 2004 onwards has reduced by 5.517MW.\n\n",

    "description": "The resource provides information on the rates of growth, competitive ability and life spans of species in the epifaunal community at Portsea.\n \nEstimates of rates of growth for all species were collected from panels immersed on 16/11/1977 except for the common barnacle (Elminius modestus) and ascidian (Didemnum augusti) which were collected from panels immersed on 24/10/1975. Length and average width of colonies or individuals and maximum height of arborescent bryozoans were made at regular intervals during the time of immersion. Colonial ascidians were the most rapid occupiers of space. In general, colonial ascidians and sponges attained a larger size and occupied space more rapidly than encrusting bryozoans. \n\nCompetitive interactions between species were examined using the same panels as described in the record 'Patterns of development in the epifaunal community at Portsea, Victoria' (File identifier: a88f2d70-ebf6-11dc-a93a-00188b4c0af8). These panels had been immersed for 2 to 42 months and fixed in formalin-sea water solution. Approximately 5500 interactions were recorded between 52 species. An interaction was defined as the overgrowth or smothering of an organism by another organism of the same or different species. For each interaction the species involved were identified, the sizes of the interacting organisms were measured and the percentage of overgrowth, if any, was estimated visually in increments of 5% overgrowth of the colony or individual. There was no single competitively dominant species in the marine epifaunal community at Portsea. The competitive ability of a species depended on the rate of growth of the species and the maximum size they could attain. The relative size of interacting colonies was often important in determining the outcome of an interaction with larger colony generally winning. \n\nThe maximum life span for each species was estimated from observations of communities on panels and on pier pilings over the 4 year period of the study (October 1975 to November 1979). The life spans of the major groups of epifauna on panesl at Portsea followed the order sponges (>24 months) > ascidians (~ 12 - 20 months) > bryozoans (~ 8 - 20 months) > barnacles, polychaetes, tubicolous amphipods and hydroids (4 - 12 months).",

    "description": "This dataset is one of a number of datasets containing geomorphological data relating to the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The dataset comprises of a digital polygon/point coverage of lakes and ponds identified from documented field observations compiled by Dr Ian D Goodwin from his own field notes as well as topographic and surface lake features identified and interpreted on aerial photographs taken by AUSLIG (now Geoscience Australia) in the 1993-94 field season. Each lake/pond is represented as a polygon with a central point label which is linked to a separate digital database (ie attribute tables) containing additional information. Sediment samples collected predominantly along the shoreline of these lakes represent a chronology of glacial events/influences on these lakes. Sediment samples taken as a profiled sequence or core can be dated using radiocarbon dating to provide a chronological picture and age occurance of deglaciation and glaciation cycles  within the Windmill Islands.",

    "description": "By quantifying the length of time after fire for obligate-seeding plant species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period), the risk of population decline under specific fire intervals can be delineated to inform local fire and conservation management. In this project, juvenile period data for serotinous obligate-seeder taxa across south-west Australia were collated from several studies. Linear models were then developed to estimate juvenile period based on measures of environmental productivity. These models were then spatially projected to the classic and drier Mediterranean agro-climatic class areas (Hutchinson et al. 2005) within south-west Australia.\nJP – 2090 RCP 8.5 - Juvenile period as years until 50% of individuals in the population have \nflowered under future conditions (30-year period centred on 2090) with the RCP 8.5 emissions \nscenario based on a model featuring annual precipitation.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the Kingfish model in the Marine Fisheries node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment.

    "description": "The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was designed to provide an overview of the impact of future climate change on all stages of production for the commodities and biosecurity risks assessed. The project used multicriteria analysis (MCA) models to produce assessments for the commodities and biosecurity risks in a consistent and comparable way, and a framework was developed to provide a rigorous, flexible and transparent process for assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change. Details of the approach and the climate data used in the assessments can be found in the Methodology Report which also details model exclusions and assumptions.\nAssessments were undertaken on commodities grouped into 6 nodes: Horticulture and Viticulture, Broadacre Cropping, Forestry, Extensive Livestock, Marine Fisheries, as well as for a set of biosecurity risks related to these primary industry sectors. The Summary Report gives details of the chosen commodities and biosecurity risks and summarises the high-level results.\nResults Reports for each commodity and biosecurity risk are being released. Visit the project's web pages to access these reports and for further information.\nThis dataset contains maps of modelled climate suitability for the sheep (June joining) model in the Extensive Livestock node of the DPIRD Climate Vulnerability Assessment. Maps are provided (in GeoTIFF format) for each element of the model: the overall climate suitability, climate suitability maps for each phenophase and also for each phenophase/climate variable combination in the model. Data is provided for each of the eight global climate models (GCMs) used in the project, as well as the climate suitability derived from historical observations, along with the ensemble median for each map.",

    "description": "This dataset presents the footprint of the percentage of adults who saw a GP for urgent medical care in the preceding 12 months. The data spans the years of 2013-2017 and is aggregated to 2015 Department of Health Primary Health Network (PHN) areas, based on the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\nThe data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016-17 Patient Experience Survey, collected between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. It also includes data from previous Patient Experience Surveys conducted in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Patient Experience Survey is conducted annually by the ABS and collects information from a representative sample of the Australian population. The Patient Experience Survey is one of several components of the Multipurpose Household Survey, as a supplement to the monthly Labour Force Survey. The Patient Experience Survey collects data on persons aged 15 years and over, who are referred to as adults for this data collection.\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Patient experiences in Australia Data Tables.\nPlease note:\n\n\nAURIN has spatially enabled the original data using the Department of Health - PHN Areas.\n\n\nPercentages are calculated based on counts that have been randomly adjusted by the ABS to avoid the release of confidential data.\n\n\nAs an indication of the accuracy of estimates, 95% confidence intervals were produced. These were calculated by the ABS using standard error estimates of the proportion.\n\n\nSome of the patient experience measures for 2016-17 have age-standardised rates presented. Age-standardised rates are hypothetical rates that would have been observed if the populations studied had the same age distribution as the standard population.\n\n\nCrude rates are provided for all years. They should be used for understanding the patterns of actual service use or level of experience in a particular PHN.\n\n\nThe Patient Experience Survey excludes persons aged less than 15 years, persons living in non-private dwellings and the Indigenous Community Strata (encompassing discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities).\n\n\nData for Northern Territory should be interpreted with caution as the Patient Experience Survey excluded the Indigenous Community Strata, which comprises around 25% of the estimated resident population of the Northern Territory living in private dwellings.\n\n\nRows that contain a \"#\" in \"Interpret with Caution\" indicates that the estimate has a relative standard error of 25% to 50%, which indicates a high level of sampling error relative to its value and must be taken into account when comparing this estimate with other values.\n\n\nNP - Not available for publication. The estimate is considered to be unreliable. Values assigned to NP in the original data have been set to null.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\n\nShort description: A network of natural and semi-natural areas which support critical ecosystem services, including connected native species habitats, and which provide for implementation of living infrastructure, active travel, climate adaptation and community wellbeing outcomes. An output of the Connecting Nature, Connecting People program, developed to guide land use and management decisions.\nCoordinate system: GDA2020 MGA zone 55\nMETHODS\nData collection / creation: The ecological network was initially derived from potential habitat and connectivity model outputs for grassland, woodland and aquatic-riparian ecosystems. These model outputs indicate potential habitat areas, fragmentation and whether a patch is big enough to provide core or corridor habitat functions for specific taxa groups. The network was created by identifying key patches of core habitat and corridors, as well as missing links that could reconnect fragmented patches. These were reviewed by several ecologists until the proposed network was agreed upon.\nThese agreed areas were converted to spatial data. Polygons were drawn around the relevant potential habitat and connectivity model outputs to simplify the data and visualise connections between habitat patches. The output was overlaid over other environmental data, including sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways and many more. Boundaries were adjusted to reflect these values as needed.\nThe ecological network was reviewed by subject matter experts and tested in a draft policy document released for public comment. Further revisions to boundaries were made following feedback. The final layer was dissolved and checked for geometry issues. \nNOTES ON USE\nQuality: The network considers an abundance and variety of datasets, including protected areas, potential habitat and connectivity maps, distribution of sensitive ecological communities, threatened species records, waterways, restoration projects, urban open spaces and community sites. Data was sourced from authoritative sources where possible. The network was verified and refined through wide distribution and review of the draft dataset, including by ACT Government ecologists and community members. Where possible, polygon boundaries were drawn around existing features (such as lakes or mapped habitat). Polygons were checked against the most recent aerial imagery to verify values and boundaries. This broad review of existing data and consultation on the output provides confidence the output represents the extent of our collective knowledge and provides a holistic illustration of known values.\nLimitations: The urban ACT Ecological network is a concept only. Polygon boundaries are hand drawn and imprecise. The data has not been ground-truthed. Boundaries should be considered approximate and verified with additional data and ground surveys. Further, the network does not assess feasibility or priorities. It does not consider species presence or absence, habitat condition, management regimes or tenure. This information should be gathered for decision making by referring to other environmental datasets, undertaking ground surveys and consulting with subject matter experts. \nData refinement: The dataset could be further improved by testing corridors against a feasibility ruleset (e.g. distance between core patches, width). Additionally, future research may support a wider range of uses by adopting a more technical approach to establish polygon boundaries or areas of interest. This would support higher spatial accuracy and enable greater certainty on what areas are within the network. A quantitative approach could support spatial statistics to aid decision making, e.g. through the ability to prioritise corridors. The Least-Cost Pathway Method is recommended for further study.\nSHARING\nLicenses/restrictions on use: Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0 (Australian Capital Territory)\nHow to cite this data: ACT Government, 2023.

    "description": "A current meter mooring was deployed in the NE section of Jervis Bay (35.0623S, 150.7672E) between 13/9/90 and 30/10/90. This mooring held two S4 Interocean current meters at depths of 11.5m and 5.5m. \n\nEach of these current meters provided two datasets. In the first, the meter integrates the signals over 2 minutes every 10 minutes, providing 10 min sample readings. The second decimated the samples using a running mean to provide hourly intervals. \n\nThe data provided includes the eastern and northern tidal components, speed, direction and temperature. The datasets providing the 10 minute sample values also give depth and salinity readings. \n\nUsers should be aware that there appears to be some distortion of data within these files. For example, the depth data recorded by the meter maintained around 11.5m produced negative values and also readings of 132m! Salinity readings from the 5.5m current meter are also missing for the start of the record.\n\n**Unfortunately one dataset is missing from this collection: The decimated hourly intervals for the meter at 5.5m have not been located, and are therefore not provided in this record**\n\nThis is one of four child records that relate to the parent, 84d67460-2ae4-11dd-a735-00188b4c0af8. A pdf outlining the structure and hierarchy of all metadata records relating to this project is available to download through this record. Also available is a pdf of a published working paper documenting this experiment and the results.",

    "description": "Modelling of landscape capacity for 75 landscape-managed NSW threatened species. \n\nLandscape capacity is a measure of how usable habitat is for supporting populations based on the quality of habitat and how easily species can move across the landscape to access sufficient resources to support a population. This project maps climate-informed landscape capacity. This mapping shows how well NSW landscapes can support fauna populations into future climate. The location of climate refugia are identified. These are areas that support species populations through time, from pre-industrial times and into the future.\n\nThe methods and descriptions of outputs are provided in the <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/publications/persistence-landscapes-project\">project report</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/d44cb0df-0242-4db3-9126-8c26aba7f80a/resource/27c36e75-690e-4fcd-88b4-b89bbdfafeba/download/plp_reportcards_final2025.pdf\">Two page species forecasts</a> summarise results for each species. \n\nEach species model is projected into NARCliM (v1.0) climate futures. The dataset comprises: individual models for 1750, 2000, 2030 and 2070 epochs; 'consensus' maps across 12 climate models for 2070; and multi-species refugia and landscape capacity across time maps (<a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/edf6e375-57c5-4f55-93f0-422a0af1900c\">for the 75 threatened species</a>, and also including site-managed species <a href=\"https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/climate-informed-plp-modelling/resource/c76d5cd9-b3d1-4622-a4d5-55aed553e38b\">here</a>). \n\nThe individual species geotiff files are grouped into zip files which are large and may take considerable time to download.\n\nThese resources are outputs of the Persistence in the Landscape Project (PLP). \n\nThis item contains landscape capacity rasters for the following species, for pre-industrial (1750), 2000, 2030 and 2070, based on NARCliM 1.0 projections:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Artamus cyanopterus cyanopterus</em>,    <strong>Dusky Woodswallow</strong></li>\n<li><em>Atrichornis rufescens</em>,  <strong>Rufous Scrub-bird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Botaurus poiciloptilus</em>, <strong>Australasian Bittern</strong></li>\n<li><em>Burhinus grallarius</em>,    <strong>Bush Stone-curlew</strong></li>\n<li><em>Callocephalon fimbriatum</em>, <strong>Gang-gang Cockatoo</strong></li>\n<li><em>Calyptorhynchus banksii samueli</em>, <strong>Red-tailed Black-Cockatoo</strong> (inland subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Calyptorhynchus lathami</em>, <strong>South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo</strong>- updated to <em>Calyptorhynchus lathami lathami</em> in the report</li>\n<li><em>Certhionyx variegatus</em>, <strong>Pied Honeyeater</strong></li>\n<li><em>Chthonicola sagittata</em>, <strong>Speckled Warbler</strong> - updated to <em>Pyrrholaemus sagittatus</em> in the report</li>\n<li><em>Cinclosoma castanotum</em>, <strong>Chestnut Quail-thrush</strong></li>\n<li><em>Circus assimilis</em>, <strong>Spotted Harrier</strong></li>\n<li><em>Climacteris picumnus victoriae</em>, <strong>Brown Treecreeper</strong> (eastern subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Coracina lineata</em>, <strong>Barred Cuckoo-shrike</strong></li>\n<li><em>Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni</em>, <strong>Coxen's Fig-Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Daphoenositta chrysoptera</em>, <strong>Varied Sittella</strong></li>\n<li><em>Dasyornis brachypterus</em>, <strong>Eastern Bristlebird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Glossopsitta pusilla</em>, <strong>Little Lorikeet</strong> - updated to <em>Parvipsitta pusilla</em> in the report </li>\n<li><em>Grantiella picta</em>, <strong>Painted Honeyeater</strong></li>\n<li><em>Hieraaetus morphnoides</em>, <strong>Little Eagle</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ixobrychus flavicollis</em>, <strong>Black Bittern</strong></li>\n<li><em>Lathamus discolor</em>, <strong>Swift Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Lophochroa leadbeateri</em>, <strong>Pink Cockatoo</strong></li>\n<li><em>Melanodryas cucullata cucullata</em>, <strong>Hooded Robin</strong> (south-eastern form)</li>\n<li><em>Melithreptus gularis gularis</em>, <strong>Black-chinned Honeyeater</strong> (eastern subspecies)</li>\n<li><em>Menura alberti</em>, <strong>Albert's Lyrebird</strong></li>\n<li><em>Neophema pulchella</em>, <strong>Turquoise Parrot</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ninox connivens</em>, <strong>Barking Owl</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ninox strenua</em>, <strong>Powerful Owl</strong></li>\n<li><em>Oxyura australis</em>, <strong>Blue-billed Duck</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pachycephala inornata</em>, <strong>Gilbert's Whistler</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pachycephala olivacea</em>, <strong>Olive Whistler</strong></li>\n<li><em>Pandion cristatus</em>, <strong>Eastern Osprey</strong></li>\n<li><em>Petroica boodang</em>, <strong>Scarlet Robin</strong></li>\n<li><em>Petroica phoenicea</em>, <strong>Flame Robin</strong></li>\n<li><em>Podargus ocellatus</em>, <strong>Marbled Frogmouth</strong></li>\n<li><em>Polytelis swainsonii</em>, <strong>Superb Parrot</strong> (breeding)</li>\n<li><em>Ptilinopus magnificus</em>, <strong>Wompoo Fruit-Dove</strong></li>\n<li><em>Ptilinopus regina</em>, <strong>Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove</strong></li>\n<li><em>Stagonopleura guttata</em>, <strong>Diamond Firetail</strong></li>\n<li><em>Stictonetta naevosa</em>, <strong>Freckled Duck</strong></li>\n<li><em>Tyto tenebricosa</em>, <strong>Sooty Owl</strong></li>\n</ul>",

Monitoring is carried out by three different boat-based sampling parties, but is co-ordinated to occur on the same day each month. \nAt each site, in-situ field measurements are taken using calibrated sensors for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Water clarity is also measured using a secchi disk. Surface and bottom water samples are collected for analysis of true color, total suspended solids(TSS), total  and dissolved nutrients, organic carbon and zinc. at most sites, depth integrated samples are also collected for chlorophyll a using a plastic tube. Bottom samples in the Middle and Outer estuary are collected using a niskin bottle. Pumps are used in the upper estuary site to fill up the bottles. All water samples are analysed at Analytical Service Tasmania, a National Association of Testing Authorities-accredited laboratory. Monitoring site depth is 2 meters",

These moorings comprise the Indonesian Throughflow array, which was deployed in June 2011. This is an important first step in the enhanced monitoring of northern Australian waters.  These shelf moorings complement the three deep-water moorings deployed in the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait to monitor inter-basin Indian-Pacific Ocean exchange.\n\nProcessed data from the first two deployments (Jun 2010 and Jan 2011) are now available.",

    "description": "In March and April, 2012, Geoscience Australia undertook a seabed characterisation survey, aimed at supporting the assessment of CO2 storage potential of the Vlaming Sub-basin, Western Australia.  The survey, undertaken as part of the National CO2 Infrastructure Plan program was targeted to provide an understanding of the link between the deep geological features of the area and the seabed, and connectivity between them as possible evidence for seal integrity.  Data was acquired in two sections of the Rottnest Shelf lying above the regional seal - the South Perth Shale - and the underlying potentially CO2-suitable reservoir, the Gage Sandstone. Seabed samples were taken from 43 stations, and included 89 seabed grab samples.  A total of 653 km2 of multibeam and backscatter data was obtained. Chirper shallow sub-bottom profile data was acquired concurrently. 6.65 km2 of side-scan sonar imagery was also obtained. The two surveyed areas, (Area 1 and Area 2), are set within a shallow sediment starved shelf setting. Area 2, situated to the southwest of Rottnest Island, is characterised by coralline red algal (rhodolith) beds, with ridges and mounds having significant rhodolith accumulations. The geomorphic expression of structural discontinuities outcropping at the seabed is evident by the presence of linear fault-like structures notable in Area 1, and north-south trending lineaments in Area 2. North-south trending structural lineaments on the outer section of Area 2 have in places, mounds standing 4-5 m above the seafloor in water depths of 80-85 m.  Although there are apparent spatial correlations between seabed geomorphology and the structural geology of the basin, the precise relationship between ridges and mounds that are overlain by rhodolith accumulations, fluid seepage, and Vlaming Sub-basin geology is uncertain, and requires further work to elucidate any links.\n\nYou can also purchase hard copies of Geoscience Australia data and other products at http://www.ga.gov.au/products-services/how-to-order-products/sales-centre.html",

    "description": "This data was collected in January 2012 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on MV L'Astrolabe (IMOS platform code: FHZI) voyage AL1112R2.\n\nDeparted:  Hobart Australia, January 06, 2012\nArrived:  \t Dumont d'Urville station, Antarctica, January, 2012\n\nData was collected from 7th-12th of January.\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube, before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards (Table 1) that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every three hours to calibrate the gas analyser. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nThe seawater intake is at about 3m depth in the bow of the ship. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) mounted in the bow thruster space near the intake. The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 50 seconds with warming usually less than 0.4ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake and supply line. Meteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ship’s logging system. The salinity values measured by the SBE21 were checked against discrete bottle samples collected on the voyage.\n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system.",

These areas are excluded from the ordinal classification as they do not have associated land-use intensity levels, thus cannot be used as a proxy for river condition.\r\n\r\nThe data was compiled using river extent data sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) [Geofabric v3.3](https://www.bom.gov.au/water/geofabric). River segments were created based on two characteristics: River Region, which are reporting regions for major river catchments in Australia, sourced from the Regions product within the BoM Geofabric v3.3; and Ecosystem Functional Group (EFG), which is the finest level of the [International Union for Conservation of Nature’s](https://iucn.org/) [Global Ecosystem Typology](https://global-ecosystems.org/) (IUCN GET) classification system.\r\n\r\nThe river segments were further broken down by assigning the LUI category for each of the corresponding time periods. Spatial layers representing Land Use Intensity were overlaid with river segments, allowing each segment to inherit the LUI classification from the adjacent land use. The subsequent river fragments were then grouped into multipart line features, with each feature representing a unique combination of River Region, EFG, and LUI for each period. This process is described in the [National Ecosystem Accounts, experimental estimates Methodology](https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/national-ecosystem-accounts-experimental-estimates-methodology/2020-21).\r\n\r\nThis dataset was used to produce summary statistics for the [National Ecosystem Accounts, experimental estimates](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/environment/environmental-accounts/national-ecosystem-accounts-experimental-estimates/2020-21). The statistics provide an overview of river condition across river regions, states and territories, based on the total length of rivers that fall within each of the LUI categories. ",

The MBRC Planning Scheme is to commence 1 February 2016. Please use this data in conjunction with the Flood Hazard and North Lakes Locality.\n\n\nPlanning schemes use zones and overlays to show the location and extent of special features that need to be considered, such as where land may be subject to hazards or other characteristics. Overlay maps may apply to all or part of your property and your property may be affected by more than one overlay. Having an overlay on your property will only affect you if you intend to develop (i.e. extent or build, change use, subdivide, clear native vegetation, fill or excavate). \nThe attribute fields are defined as per Qld Planning Provisions, Schedule 2. The Queensland Planning Provisions (QPP) are the standard planning scheme provisions made by the Minister for Planning under Chapter 2, Part 5, Division 2 and Chapter 2, Part 6 of the Sustainable Planning Act 2009.",

    "description": "This data was collected in March 2008 by the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurement research group on RV Southern Surveyor (IMOS platform code: VLHJ) voyage SS042008.\n\nDeparted: \tHobart, Tasmania, March 20, 2008\nArrived:  \tHobart, Tasmania, March 26, 2008\n\nCO2 System Overview:\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater was measured using a General Oceanics Inc. automated system (Model 8050; Pierrot et al 2009). Seawater is sprayed into an equilibration chamber and CO2 in the headspace gas equilibrates with the seawater. The headspace gas is pumped through a thermoelectric condenser followed by a nafion drying tube before flowing through a Licor 7000 non-dispersive infrared gas analyser used to measure the CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) of the dried air. The gas flow is stopped temporarily for the CO2 measurements, which are made at atmospheric pressure. A set of four CO2 standards that cover the range of CO2 values expected in the ocean are analysed about every four hours to calibrate the gas analyser. The standard gas concentrations are on the WMO-X2007 mole fraction scale for CO2-in-air. Atmospheric XCO2 (dry) is measured after the standards by pumping clean outside air from an intake on the forward mast of the ship. \n\nSeawater intake and ancillary data:\nThe seawater intake is located at about 5.5m depth in the bow of the ship. Sea surface salinity is measured using a thermosalinograph (Seabird Electronics SBE21) located next to the CO2 system. A remote temperature sensor (Seabird Electronics SBE 38) located at the intake is used to measure sea surface temperature (SST). The travel time between the intake and CO2 system is typically about 4 minutes with warming usually less than 0.6ºC. The thermosalinograph water is from the same intake, but the supply lines separate after the intake. A comparison of thermosalinograph and equilibrator temperature records shows the temperature difference in the two lines is generally less than 0.1ºC. The thermosalinograph water line travels outside the ship and is typically warmer than the equilibrator. The travel time in water line to the thermosalinograph is 2.5 minutes faster than to the equilibrator. \n\nMeteorological data, salinity, SST, and ships position and time are taken from the ships logging system. These parameters and the data quality are maintained by the Australian Marine National Facility.",
